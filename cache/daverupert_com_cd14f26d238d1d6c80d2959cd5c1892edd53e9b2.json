I wanted to surf and create content on the information super highway. Through Angelfire and AOL Pages, I stayed up late creating my own worlds on the World Wide Web.\nIn 1998, I went to college and was peer pressured to use Netscape by my roommates. Netscape had an exciting atmosphere about it, and its move to open source turned fellow Computer Science nerds into gleeful converts. That move to open source would be a critical change in the life of Netscape but also in the life of the Web and in the story of Internet Explorer.\nIn 2000, I used my student discount to get a copy of FrontPage 98. FrontPage had all these cool DHTML effects like “glow” using proprietary ActiveX controls. I liked the effects so much, I switched back to using Internet Explorer 5. The year 2001 would bring us IE6 on Windows XP with a brand new aesthetic that made Netscape feel ancient. During these years I built websites for college groups like my ultimate frisbee team and was blissfully ignorant of the fact that they didn’t work the same in non-IE browsers. This is some foreshadowing of the problems with IE’s monopoly.\nIn 2003, I saved enough money through my first fulltime job to buy my first Macbook Pro. OS X 10.1 was new at the time and Safari didn’t exist yet so I used Internet Explorer 5.5, which took the “Aqua” aesthetic to heart and had a cool feature that would ping a list of your favorite sites to check for updates; a weird precursor to RSS. Later in 2003, Apple released Safari and —Apple fanboy that I was— I switched to that.\nIn 2006, I started doing web development as a job. I read Zeldman’s Designing for Web Standards and became passionate about web standards. IE6, in a web of web standards, earned a bit of a bad rap among developers due to its bespoke box model and lack of updates (compared to Firefox, Safari, and soon Chrome). IE7 did come out, then IE8. Each one better than the one before but still with their own quirks that left them with a bad feeling. IE became the butt of every conference joke. “What about IE?” became the bane of every person talking about new web features. We put “Upgrade your browser” or “Try Firefox” banners on our sites. We collectively tried to eradicate it.\nIn 2011, Nishant Kothary invited Jason Santa Maria, Frank Chrimero, Naz Hamid, and Paravel to work on a project called “Lost World’s Fairs” to celebrate the launch of IE9 and highlight its newfound support of WOFF web fonts. A celebration of the Web and what browsers can do. IE9 was a massive improvement and it seemed like the gears of change were turning. For sure one of the funnest projects I’ve ever worked on where I got to flex my skills.\nIn 2012, in part due to the work on the Lost World’s Fair site, Paravel was able to work on the Microsoft.com homepage, right around the launch of Windows 8 (featuring the short-lived Internet Explorer 10). Gruber liked it and I heard Steve Ballmer himself gave it a thumbs up. Pretty cool.\nIn 2015, I switched back to Windows for #davegoeswindows. Part of the unpaid deal was to try and use Edge, the successor to IE, as my daily browser. It’s still impressive what the original Edge team did in an attempt to salvage a browser and its reputation. Pivoting from the old Trident rendering engine to EdgeHTML, rearchitecting its security principles, and building something modern and fast. There were leftover IE bits in Edge (e.g., F12 Developer Tools), but I got used to it and experienced using “not the most cutting edge” browser as my daily driver. The #davegoeswindows experiment was one of the most educational stunts I’ve ever done.\nThis week on June 15th, 2022, Internet Explorer reached its end of life and is no longer supported by Microsoft. I think this is something to celebrate. It’s the end of non-evergreen browsers. While “Evergreen” does not mean immediately available and saying “IE is dead” doesn’t mean someone out there isn’t using it, my hope is those people don’t become a gigantic strawman like “the boss who uses IE” did. It’s important to celebrate that outdated software licenses for governments and enterprise IT departments forcing legacy browser usage no longer control our industry or our collective conscious.

      "title": "Vibe Check №17",
      "summary": "May is over already which means the kids are now out of school, summer has begun, and work is ramping up at Luro. Here is the retelling of vibes…\n\nThe little league championship 🏆\nIn my last vibe check I mentioned my son’s little league experience and how he and his teammates talked about the playoffs, but I wasn’t sure if they existed or not. Well… the playoffs were real! A single elimination playoff bracket. Eight teams enter, one team leaves…\nOtis’s team, the Athletics, squeaked their way through to the finals and ended up winning the Northwest Little League championship. 🎉\nA happy, unexpected end to our first full season of baseball. Seeing the growth of every kid on every team over the course of a season was a treat. At the beginning of the season no one can pitch and it’s a walk-a-thon, but then the pitchers start throwing strikes, then the kids realize they can’t stand there and need to start hitting, then the kids realize they need to start fielding the ball, then they start making plays and forcing outs. It’s a how-to play baseball montage that happens over eight weeks. The coaches did a phenomenal job and fostered a great experience.\nThe road to productivity hell is paved with context switching\nIn mid-April my wife got a job at the kids’ elementary school. It’s awesome and I think the job suits her unique skills; namely she can remember everyone’s name. One side effect of this lifestyle change is we destroyed the balance of household duties we’ve established over the last ~8 years since having kids.\nWe expected the change but a lot of May was about adjusting to this new balance. A day went like this: Wake up make breakfasts and lunch → Get the kids off to school → Work for an hour or two → Interrupt my morning flow with a meeting → Work a bit and get lunch → Sit down at my desk for an hour → Get the kids from school → Get the kids to swim → The kids ask me for snacks until their mom gets home → Try to get another hour of work done…\nDarn near impossible to establish any sort of deep work rhythm with that schedule. As a result I’m not sure I was as productive as I hoped to be last month.\nThe family context switching was extra, but even work had a considerable bit of context switching. A lot of switching back and forth between backend work → frontend work but also switching from building the product → building the business → building the engineering team. In a day I might cycle between product dev work → documentation → testing → meetings → podcasts → research → learning → side projects → open source. Each of those contexts have a Brain RAM cost. Mix in my (undiagnosed) ADHD and what a wonderful tapestry of distraction and experiences.\nFor some reason I thought this would be a good month to try live streaming some side project work on Twitch. After three streams I think my streaming career is kaput. In a different multiverse where I have no kids, I’m not starting a company, or if my work duties radically change… it could potentially work.\nThe tl;dr here is I need to eliminate some extra contexts from my life. That hurts my heart but the road to burnout is paved with context switching and we don’t want that. My new goal in life —after getting a breakfast platter named after me— is to be so bored I have time to read a magazine subscription.\nNew hires and new features\nAn exciting month at the job. We managed to hire two talented folks who are going to help us build the future of Luro. One person is already onboarded and one arrives next week.\nHiring people is a lot of work. Who knew. All worth it, of course. First off, as a business, you need to know how you’re going to assess the skills and “fit” of a person. In Good to Great, Jim Collins calls this “getting the right people on the bus”, but ethically you also want to do that in a way that’s as fair and unbiased as possible. To me, this means establishing a standard interview template (with some flexibility) and devising a grading system. This complete guide to job interviewing was helpful but you need to mix in some engineering specifics.\nThen you need to comb backlogs, perform mini-explorations of near-future features, speculate far off features; all to figure out your exact skill gaps and what types of roles might fill those gaps.\nThen you need to determine if a job candidate’s skills match those gaps. This is hard for me, because I optimistically believe everyone has potential to figure out everything, but in startup land, that time and runway is somewhat precious.\nThen, if you make a hire, before they show up you have to:\n\nMake sure all your documentation is up-to-snuff\nMake sure the local dev environment stands up in minutes and not days\nCreate some Good First Issue tickets\nDevise some low- to high-challenge tasks for ramping up, hopefully providing exposure to critical parts of the application\nEstablish clear and concrete goals and objectives\n\nI’ve also decided that for every new hire I’m going make sure all module dependencies and Node versions are as updated as possible, so those problems don’t create a bad first install experience.

I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.\nYou see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” = yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” = yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” = yes, even cooler. “DAOs let communities have ownership in the projects they like” = yes, in theory1. At its core, even the basic idea of a sci-fi reality where we zlorp our space credits to each other on our holo-visors seems like a probable eventuality.\nFrom Easter 2020 to Easter 2021 I watched in my Stocks app as the price of $ETH went from $180 to $2230 (+1,288%)  and $SOL went from $0.60 to $31.70 (+5,221%). Dang. Regret. I should have bought. But two weeks later I watched as both of those coins lost 50% of their value overnight. Phew. Vindication.\nThe price of course rebounded and climbed 10× around November 2021. Dang. Regret. This was the peak NFT era, it seemed crypto was approaching a critical mass. Actual smart people I knew were holding crypto. Actual smart people I know were leaving their FAANG jobs to join Web3 projects. Every conversation I had ended up talking about crypto. The FOMO was building.\nI somehow convinced myself that I needed to go in and go in big. If my $500 turned into $600 or even $1000, that doesn’t materially change my life that much. It’s not “Buy a boat” money. It had to be a large number. So I started pooling together about $10,000 to spread over a handful of coins that I thought had a strategic advantage:\n\n$ETH - smart contracts are pretty smart\n$SOL - a greener alternative to $ETH\n$LUNA - backed by a “stablecoin” and that sounded nice\n$DOGE - for the memes but it goes up every time Elon tweets about it and you can buy a lot of it for cheap\n\nAt the pace crypto was going I was confident I could double my money over the course of a couple months. I needed to pull the trigger.\nAfter gut-checking with friends (who were like “Sure, man”), my wife (who to this day says, “I don’t get it”), my financial advisor (who was like 😬), and doing my own research… I decided not to pull the trigger. The lack of consumer protections, the surface area for criminal activity (scams, theft, laundering, wash trading), the way your cash-on-hand is also your investment portfolio, the fake scarcity, the rich getting richer, the low-quality art in the form of monkey JPGs selling at inflated prices, gas fees, and the carbon costs… those all bothered me immensely. Ultimately I felt like crypto was a 2010 solution (electricity is free!) that didn’t fit 2021 problems (we are soon approaching the 1.5ºC thresh hold!).\nInstead of investing actual money, I installed a Stock Market Simulator on my iPad and played pretend crypto. If my imaginary numbers went up, I could revisit the idea. But over the course of a couple months, I watched the numbers turn redder and redder.\n\nAs of writing this: $ETH is down 58%, $SOL is down 82%, $LUNA has lost 99.97% of its value. I’m not some genius investor that shorted the entire crypto market and made millions, but I keep thinking about how I dodged a bullet and saved about $8000 by not investing in crypto. Phew. Vindication.\nIt’s all relative. If I had bought two years ago, I’d still be up a bit. A lotta bit actually. But back then I would have invested something small like $500. Still, my $500 of imaginary $SOL would be worth $44,000. Dang. Regret. That’s incredible, yet all feels so made up. It’s like how Uber is a taxi company with no cars, crypto is an economy with no tangible goods and services.\nI could still end up with egg on my face here. The minute the market drops 10~20% and I feel vindicated about my decision to hold off, some pump’n’dump happens to spike the price up +20%. And for some reason my lizard brain still says “Dang.

      "summary": "One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.\nTake color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.\n\nThe rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.\nIn design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel, an infinitely wrapping spectrum of rainbow colors.\n\nA beautiful rainbow circle, I hope my computer is okay.\nThen… we learn about saturation. Colors can be vibrant and saturated or duller and unsaturated shades. You can tune color wheels to provide this effect, but for the best representation of color saturation, we need another axis as if color exists on an XY chart.\n\nThus color pickers! The horizontal X-axis reflects the hue across the ROYGBIV spectrum and the vertical Y-axis reflects the saturation. Adding another dimension helps explain color and saturation in a single image. Two axes are better than one.\nBut look! On this particular color picker there’s a slider to control another aspect of color: lightness, a way to tint a color lighter and darker. This hints that our XY plot isn’t enough.\nThis is where math and algorithmic representations of colors and lightwaves start coming into play. On the web, we can express over 16 million colors using a mix of red, green and blue pixels or expressing a color in an alternate method of combining hue, saturation and lightness; each three properties, three dimensions of differentiation. We actually need three axes to visualize our color possibilities which we can do in a three dimensional space.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe RGB color space looks like a gay Rubik’s cube and the HSL color space looks like a birthday cake drenched in icing. Each color-space (RGB, HSL, CMYK, Lab, etc) has its own different space of representable colors! The algorithm for each color-space gives us a different perspective. David Briggs has a collection of renderings of color spaces next to each other.\n\nThe shape of the color space is somewhat dependent on the math and algorithmic shorthand used by the color profile to derive the colors. Steve Eddins generated a beautiful rendering of a rotation of the Lab color-space and it’s one of my favorite renderings I’ve come across.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere’s more color spaces to explore! I found an old app for Windows called Gamutvision that tries to visualize these color spaces. John Austin explains the mathematical history of color spaces. Craig Hockenberry —who wrote a book on color—  wrote about Apple’s new wide-gamut displays and links to an even more in-depth look at color gamuts on Mac. There’s newer and wider gamuts on the horizon too, colors we’ve never seen on the screen before!\nPeople see color differently. Not just that they bought a nice TV or phone with a wider-gamut and more accurate algorithm, but also due to a variety of cultural or physiological differences as well.\n\nIn Japan they call the color of their verdant bamboo mountains, leafy green vegetables, green apples, and the color of the “go” signal on a traffic light; 青 (blue). I learned the history of this in college, but it always caught me by surprise an entire nation could be so collectively wrong… or was I the one who was wrong in that particular cultural setting?\nPersonal perspective factors in too, even factoring out colorblindness. My wife calls the international walk signal pictogram “the blue walking man” and while it does have a blue-ish tint, I guffaw because it’s clearly white. And don’t get me started about the color of a tennis ball; she insists it’s “fluorescent green” and I recognize it as the color “fluorescent yellow” —as in “optic yellow”, the literal color name for a tennis ball— but it’s hard to say who’s right. We’re not alone in our disagreement and the Wikipedia page for tennis ball is now locked after hundreds of edit wars over dozens of years.\nSo that’s color. It can be a spectrum and you wouldn’t be wrong, but the possibilities of color are more accurately modeled in a multi-dimensional space. I’m not anti-spectrum, they’re an improvement over binaries, but they rarely sum up the entire issue at hand. Factor in your culture’s understanding of color or your personal understanding of color via the rods and cones in your eyeballs… color is both extremely objective and extremely subjective. And on a computer, the hardware algorithm that is showing you the colors might also limit your perception of color.\nAnyways, those are my thoughts on spectrums. I feel you can apply multi-dimensional thinking to a lot of ideas: good vs. evil, gender, politics, disabilities, technology choices, kanbans, video game character balance, and the list goes on. Your mileage may vary, but I think there’s one thing we can all agree on; most dichotomies are false. 😉",

Each color-space (RGB, HSL, CMYK, Lab, etc) has its own different space of representable colors! The algorithm for each color-space gives us a different perspective. David Briggs has a collection of renderings of color spaces next to each other.\n\nThe shape of the color space is somewhat dependent on the math and algorithmic shorthand used by the color profile to derive the colors. Steve Eddins generated a beautiful rendering of a rotation of the Lab color-space and it’s one of my favorite renderings I’ve come across.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere’s more color spaces to explore! I found an old app for Windows called Gamutvision that tries to visualize these color spaces. John Austin explains the mathematical history of color spaces. Craig Hockenberry —who wrote a book on color—  wrote about Apple’s new wide-gamut displays and links to an even more in-depth look at color gamuts on Mac. There’s newer and wider gamuts on the horizon too, colors we’ve never seen on the screen before!\nPeople see color differently. Not just that they bought a nice TV or phone with a wider-gamut and more accurate algorithm, but also due to a variety of cultural or physiological differences as well.\n\nIn Japan they call the color of their verdant bamboo mountains, leafy green vegetables, green apples, and the color of the “go” signal on a traffic light; 青 (blue). I learned the history of this in college, but it always caught me by surprise an entire nation could be so collectively wrong… or was I the one who was wrong in that particular cultural setting?\nPersonal perspective factors in too, even factoring out colorblindness. My wife calls the international walk signal pictogram “the blue walking man” and while it does have a blue-ish tint, I guffaw because it’s clearly white. And don’t get me started about the color of a tennis ball; she insists it’s “fluorescent green” and I recognize it as the color “fluorescent yellow” —as in “optic yellow”, the literal color name for a tennis ball— but it’s hard to say who’s right. We’re not alone in our disagreement and the Wikipedia page for tennis ball is now locked after hundreds of edit wars over dozens of years.\nSo that’s color. It can be a spectrum and you wouldn’t be wrong, but the possibilities of color are more accurately modeled in a multi-dimensional space. I’m not anti-spectrum, they’re an improvement over binaries, but they rarely sum up the entire issue at hand. Factor in your culture’s understanding of color or your personal understanding of color via the rods and cones in your eyeballs… color is both extremely objective and extremely subjective. And on a computer, the hardware algorithm that is showing you the colors might also limit your perception of color.\nAnyways, those are my thoughts on spectrums. I feel you can apply multi-dimensional thinking to a lot of ideas: good vs. evil, gender, politics, disabilities, technology choices, kanbans, video game character balance, and the list goes on. Your mileage may vary, but I think there’s one thing we can all agree on; most dichotomies are false. 😉",

      "summary": "April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.\nA new lawn\n\nMy wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.\nSurprise remodeling project! Setting the landscape (heh), while the existing landscaping was wonderful and charming, in practice it didn’t work well for our family. My wife and I worked hard to narrow the scope and priority of the projects we needed done.\nProject #1: The front yard\nThe front yard zeroscape treatment featured two amoeba-shaped rings of grass surrounded by crushed granite rocks. Modern, low maintenance, but the slope of the front yard causes all those rocks wash into the street every time it rains. I get the joy of looking like an asshole once a month shoveling the rocks from the street back into my yard. Project #1: Replace rocks with grass.\nWe also needed some concrete steps, but I didn’t want to blow the scope of the project and delay it further by mixing trades, so this was #4 on our list of priorities.\nProject #2: The rock pit\nIn the backyard I worked hard to remove a big area of english ivy and revealed a rock pit. Yikes. A haven for snakes, roaches, and mosquitos. I removed the rocks and thankfully my other neighbor Jason took some of those rocks, but I still had two mounds of dirt surrounding the pit that must have been a pond at some point. Now every kid loves a rock pit to play in, but a flat patch of grass would be more useful to our family. Project #2: Fill pit with dirt and cover with grass.\nProject #3: The side yard\nOn the side yard, we had another english ivy zone that didn’t do much other than eat lost toys. Ideally this could be usable space where we could park our garbage cans or possibly another camper one day. This was a stretch goal. Project  #3: Convert ivy side yard to a crushed granite pad.\nI love it when a plan comes together\nI was happy to do this all as separate projects over different months, but José and his crew made some on the fly decisions that tied the projects together and made everything more efficient.\nThey removed the rocks from the front yard (Project #1) and dumped them in the side yard (Project #3). Then they took the dirt mounds from the rock pit (Project #2) and used that as fill for the front yard where the rocks were (Project #1). After about two days of work, we were ready for the four pallets of sod.\nAs we were preparing for the grass, José said he knew a concrete guy. A couple of quick conversations and we were pouring concrete within the week. The total turnaround time on the entire project was about 2 weeks. In the blink of an eye, I had a new front and back yard.\nSt. Augustine is a hearty stubborn grass that grows well here in Texas. It’s a bit water-hungry and I know that’s going to bite me in the upcoming Water Wars, but I think grass was a good choice and my microbiome seems to support it (we were the only rock yard on the street). And the results seem to have had a cooling effect on the whole property. The other grass seems happier, the trees seem happier, I’m happier; it works.\nThere’s a sense of relief and pride that comes with finishing a project that’s been on your dockett for years. We now have a usable front yard that doesn’t stab your feet as you run out to grab something from the car barefoot. With the shed, the flattened lawn, and the trampoline, we now have the backyard we’ve envisioned for awhile. It’s all come together. That project’s done. Next we battle the mosquitos.\nMy web component workshop and my web component talk\nThe second week of April I headed up to Minneapolis to do my Frontend Masters workshop. My whole year so far had been working towards that, so there’s a sense of relief to have that checked off my to-do list. A months worth of nights and weekends went into preparing the course, building an entire online guidebook for the course, and making slides. Then for that workshop day you have to upload an internet’s worth of know-how into your “Brain RAM”, it’s a bit overwhelming. But I think it went well, I learned a lot about giving workshops, and I look forward to people’s feedback when the course gets released.\nThe next week I did my web components talk at An Event Apart and a LIVE ShopTalk as well. The crew at An Event Apart work hard to put on a good conference. Wil Reynolds’s talk on SEO keeps rattling around in my brain the most. He spoke about how the context of words change when they’re next to other words, and if you manage to win the keyword lottery how do you meet customers expectations by delivering on those words. You should find this talk, I’m not doing it justice. Thanks again to AEA for having me.\nThus ends this spring conference season for me. I haven’t made any hard decisions about speaking at future conferences, but I am acknowledging to myself they are a tough fit for me and my life right now while starting a new company (Luro). As I understand my chaos brain a bit more, diverting extra brain cycles to prepare a talk while doing my job, life, kids, etc was a skill… but now it’s a pretty risky maneuver to add to the Jenga tower of obligations without careful consideration.\nBaseball and the suburban life\nWe are deep into the shuttling kids around to their activities lifestyle. While my wife does most of this, I spent a lot of April evenings down at the baseball fields with my son Otis. I didn’t know if he’d every want to try baseball again after COVID cancelled his first season of baseball. A weird side effect of parenting small kids thru COVID is its not uncommon that they might have missed some critical socialization windows or —in our case— learning how to play group sports. Thankfully they have a cohort of kids in the same boat.\nAs each week progresses Otis is getting better at hitting, throwing, and fielding. It’s great to see him start to figure out the mechanics of the game and his body. Although it wreaks havoc on bedtime routines, it’s been a fun ritual to be out watching these kids learn and play the game under the lights of the field. It’s a good little taste of Americana.\nBaseball is a bit of a flash mob event though and the season ends the first week of May. He’s excited his team has a chance to go to the championship, but I can’t tell if that’s a real thing or a thing he and his teammates made up. I think we’re already looking at signing up “fall ball”, my daughter Emi wants to play too. Looking forward to that if it happens.\nI turned 42\nAt the end of the month, I added another year to the sum of my lifespan. This happen most years so it wasn’t a shock. Somewhere Neil deGrasse Tyson is saying “Space doesn’t care about your birthday”, but birthdays are still nice to have sometimes.\nTo celebrate this year, we kept it a bit low-key and had groups of friends from different corners of my life gathered at my house in my new backyard. We ate BBQ and drank swampwater while herds of kids migrated between the house and trampoline and back, zig-zagging around us like the mosquitos. I had a great afternoon/evening and I’m thankful to know such wonderful people.\n\nStats\nWhat you all actually came for. Ugh, nerds.\n\n💪 Fitness - Mediocre performance.\n\nClosed my rings 9 times.\nI was under 240lbs (Goal! 🙌) but only for one day. I think a single HIIT workout did the trick. So will try more of those.\n\n\n🧶 Crafting - No big crafts.\n📖 Reading - Two books about the apocalypse.\n\nStation Eleven - The book that inspired the HBO show (I haven’t watched). Great book. A little too close to home with the central premise being a pandemic and whatnot.\nThe Ends of the World - Recommended by Rob Dodson, The Ends of the World a scientific retelling of the five mass extinction events that have already happened on the earth and a look how humans are catapulting ourselves towards another event. Ironically, not as anxiety inducing as the apocalyptic fiction book.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime - Mostly just YouTubes.\n\nAl Bladez - extreme tall grass lawncare\nSpeak the Truth - a look at the Ukrainian war from a tactical military perspective\nWent on a weird bender about how Egyptians built the pyramids.\nLots of “wet fart prank” videos. I ain’t proud of it, but it gave me some joy this month.\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nJoined the Overwatch 2 Beta\nStacklands by Sokpop\nKnotwords by Zach Gage (and that got me back on my Good Sudoku addiction)\nCouple of Wordle clones: Melodle, 言葉で遊ぼう\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes - A pretty standard month\n\nRecorded a workshop for Frontend Masters\nA LIVE ShopTalk at An Event Apart\nNo ShopTalk videos, but will resume in May.\n\n\n📝 Blogging - Good month of blogging. 7 new posts. I’m ahead on my blogging OKRs for the quarter. And, as you can see, I’ve started on an open redesign project. May be doing some streams soon.\n\nWhat if… one day everything got better? - The most important post I wrote this month.\n7 Web Component Tricks - Possibly my highest traffic post.\nMy Weekly Engineering Report - A quaint little process post.\nProductivity-sniped by PARA - My favorite post of the month.\nAn unplanned open redesign - Behind the scenes of the redesign.\nInspiration in the Tall Grass - An inspiration post\nServer-side vs Client-side Analytics - See my blog stats in this comparison post!\n\n\n",

A months worth of nights and weekends went into preparing the course, building an entire online guidebook for the course, and making slides. Then for that workshop day you have to upload an internet’s worth of know-how into your “Brain RAM”, it’s a bit overwhelming.

The crew at An Event Apart work hard to put on a good conference. Wil Reynolds’s talk on SEO keeps rattling around in my brain the most.

      "content_text": "April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.\nA new lawn\n\nMy wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.\nSurprise remodeling project! Setting the landscape (heh), while the existing landscaping was wonderful and charming, in practice it didn’t work well for our family. My wife and I worked hard to narrow the scope and priority of the projects we needed done.\nProject #1: The front yard\nThe front yard zeroscape treatment featured two amoeba-shaped rings of grass surrounded by crushed granite rocks. Modern, low maintenance, but the slope of the front yard causes all those rocks wash into the street every time it rains. I get the joy of looking like an asshole once a month shoveling the rocks from the street back into my yard. Project #1: Replace rocks with grass.\nWe also needed some concrete steps, but I didn’t want to blow the scope of the project and delay it further by mixing trades, so this was #4 on our list of priorities.\nProject #2: The rock pit\nIn the backyard I worked hard to remove a big area of english ivy and revealed a rock pit. Yikes. A haven for snakes, roaches, and mosquitos. I removed the rocks and thankfully my other neighbor Jason took some of those rocks, but I still had two mounds of dirt surrounding the pit that must have been a pond at some point. Now every kid loves a rock pit to play in, but a flat patch of grass would be more useful to our family. Project #2: Fill pit with dirt and cover with grass.\nProject #3: The side yard\nOn the side yard, we had another english ivy zone that didn’t do much other than eat lost toys. Ideally this could be usable space where we could park our garbage cans or possibly another camper one day. This was a stretch goal. Project  #3: Convert ivy side yard to a crushed granite pad.\nI love it when a plan comes together\nI was happy to do this all as separate projects over different months, but José and his crew made some on the fly decisions that tied the projects together and made everything more efficient.\nThey removed the rocks from the front yard (Project #1) and dumped them in the side yard (Project #3). Then they took the dirt mounds from the rock pit (Project #2) and used that as fill for the front yard where the rocks were (Project #1). After about two days of work, we were ready for the four pallets of sod.\nAs we were preparing for the grass, José said he knew a concrete guy. A couple of quick conversations and we were pouring concrete within the week. The total turnaround time on the entire project was about 2 weeks. In the blink of an eye, I had a new front and back yard.\nSt. Augustine is a hearty stubborn grass that grows well here in Texas. It’s a bit water-hungry and I know that’s going to bite me in the upcoming Water Wars, but I think grass was a good choice and my microbiome seems to support it (we were the only rock yard on the street). And the results seem to have had a cooling effect on the whole property. The other grass seems happier, the trees seem happier, I’m happier; it works.\nThere’s a sense of relief and pride that comes with finishing a project that’s been on your dockett for years. We now have a usable front yard that doesn’t stab your feet as you run out to grab something from the car barefoot. With the shed, the flattened lawn, and the trampoline, we now have the backyard we’ve envisioned for awhile. It’s all come together. That project’s done. Next we battle the mosquitos.\nMy web component workshop and my web component talk\nThe second week of April I headed up to Minneapolis to do my Frontend Masters workshop. My whole year so far had been working towards that, so there’s a sense of relief to have that checked off my to-do list. A months worth of nights and weekends went into preparing the course, building an entire online guidebook for the course, and making slides. Then for that workshop day you have to upload an internet’s worth of know-how into your “Brain RAM”, it’s a bit overwhelming. But I think it went well, I learned a lot about giving workshops, and I look forward to people’s feedback when the course gets released.\nThe next week I did my web components talk at An Event Apart and a LIVE ShopTalk as well. The crew at An Event Apart work hard to put on a good conference. Wil Reynolds’s talk on SEO keeps rattling around in my brain the most. He spoke about how the context of words change when they’re next to other words, and if you manage to win the keyword lottery how do you meet customers expectations by delivering on those words. You should find this talk, I’m not doing it justice. Thanks again to AEA for having me.\nThus ends this spring conference season for me. I haven’t made any hard decisions about speaking at future conferences, but I am acknowledging to myself they are a tough fit for me and my life right now while starting a new company (Luro). As I understand my chaos brain a bit more, diverting extra brain cycles to prepare a talk while doing my job, life, kids, etc was a skill… but now it’s a pretty risky maneuver to add to the Jenga tower of obligations without careful consideration.\nBaseball and the suburban life\nWe are deep into the shuttling kids around to their activities lifestyle. While my wife does most of this, I spent a lot of April evenings down at the baseball fields with my son Otis. I didn’t know if he’d every want to try baseball again after COVID cancelled his first season of baseball. A weird side effect of parenting small kids thru COVID is its not uncommon that they might have missed some critical socialization windows or —in our case— learning how to play group sports. Thankfully they have a cohort of kids in the same boat.\nAs each week progresses Otis is getting better at hitting, throwing, and fielding. It’s great to see him start to figure out the mechanics of the game and his body. Although it wreaks havoc on bedtime routines, it’s been a fun ritual to be out watching these kids learn and play the game under the lights of the field. It’s a good little taste of Americana.\nBaseball is a bit of a flash mob event though and the season ends the first week of May. He’s excited his team has a chance to go to the championship, but I can’t tell if that’s a real thing or a thing he and his teammates made up. I think we’re already looking at signing up “fall ball”, my daughter Emi wants to play too. Looking forward to that if it happens.\nI turned 42\nAt the end of the month, I added another year to the sum of my lifespan. This happen most years so it wasn’t a shock.

You may have noticed something is a little fishy about this data.\nBefore I jump to any conclusions, I wanted to check my data with their sources.\nFeedback from Fathom and Netlify\nI tweeted about this phenomenon in 2019…\nServer-side @netlify stats vs. Client-side @usefathom stats (over the last ~4 weeks)439k pageviews vs 12.5k pageviews44k uniques vs. 7.9k uniques pic.twitter.com/ARoW82BhAm— Dave Rupert (@davatron5000) July 11, 2019 \nAfter tweeting about it Netlify and Fathom both reached out to me. It’s a bit of a he-said/she-said situation about who’s data is most correct, but some high-level notes add value to the conversation.\n\nFathom’s point of view was that I was on the outdated community product and the SaaS product is much better and more accurate now. I don’t doubt the paid product is better, but I do doubt it would close the 18× gap on the Netlify numbers.\nNetlify’s take was pretty matter-of-fact. “Yup. This reflects the log data.” They’re not wrong, raw server logs don’t lie. Their investigation into the matter turned up two anomalies I can’t solve:\n\n80% of the hits to my Responsive Deliverables post contain a utm_campaign= query param, which tells me people love my footnote about SMACSS. Some bot (in Germany?) must be hammering that campaign URL.\nThere’s a Google Cloud Uptime Monitor health check pointed at my site. This is helpful, except that I never set one up! Another rogue bot (in Germany?) is pinging my old content thousands of times a day.\n\n\n\nFathom’s numbers seem more believable but Netlify’s data eliminates any ad blocking questions. My one small takeaway is that it’d be nice if I could filter out known bot traffic from Netlify’s reporting. That might remove the delta to an acceptable degree.\nBig conclusions about data-driven decision making\nThe data tells me I get somewhere between 12k and 26k visitors to my site who open anywhere between 18k and 333k pages. If I stare at the larger numbers, that is impressive but not actionable. Comparing 2019 to 2022, Netlify is showing a 25% drop in pageviews and a 41% drop in uniques, while Fathom is showing almost the inverse.\nThis isn’t a judgement on Netlify or Fathom, they are both incredible services that offer incredible analytics products. But it leaves me in a position of wondering who should I believe?\nMy trust level in analytics products is low\nMy trust in analytics data is at an all-time low. Browser-level privacy improvements, ad blockers, and bot traffic have obliterated the data integrity. Unless I’m a certified statistician, I’m unable to accurately assess traffic to my breakfast table.\nI used to believe people were honest, but seeing all this bot traffic on my little site I could see how someone might point bots at their own site to inflate their traffic stats, gain perceived popularity, which they then pass on to advertisers. My ad vendor’s FAQ page has a note that says “Bots account for as much as 80% of website traffic”, yikes.\nData-driven decisions can be a blindspot\nIf I believed Netlify’s data as gospel, I would be a blogging sensation! I should quit my job and do blogging fulltime. Four million eyeballs per year. Following Netlify’s data to its logical extreme, I should be structuring my new blogging business like so:\n\nWriting a lot of content about responsive design and 4K monitors.\nInvesting  a lot in German and Finnish localized content.\nI’d should be in full panic mode about my 41% drop in uniques.\n\nI love Germany (and I hear Finland is great), but I suspect they’re not my #1 and #2 markets. And those vintage 2014 posts are okay, but should not be the core of my content strategy.\nIf I, or some hypothetical manager, put too much stock into these metrics I could see it causing a firestorm of reprioritization based on bot traffic1. We’d be chasing the tail of a health check bot somewhere in Germany.\nThe point is, you can enter a McNamara Fallacy if you base your business solely on quantitative data.\nYou need more than just metrics\nProbably old advice, but you need a mixture of quantitative AND qualitative data to make good decisions.

      "title": "Inspiration in the Tall Grass",
      "summary": "I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.\n\nMy favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AP take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.\nThe circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.\nSometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy.

      "summary": "Howdy! If you frequent this website often, you’ll notice some changes. This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.\n~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.\nWithout further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…\nWebsite feature inventory\nHere’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:\n\n330+ blog posts\nArt-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SVGs\nOpen Graph images (handmade)\nsitemap.xml\nRSS feed\n███ ████\nCode samples\nCodepen, YouTube, and Vimeo embeds\nAbout Timeline (YAML-powered)\nBookshelf (YAML-powered)\nLikes (RSS-powered)\n/uses page\nService worker + offline page\n\nMy checks are all manual right now, but not rocket science. I created a “secret” page to roll up all my art-directed posts and I’m happy to report just a few are super fucked up. One day I’ll add proper visual integration tests, but today is not that day.\nWhich leads me to the next step, let’s define the goals and non-goals for this project so we can finish on time.\nGoals and non-goals\nThe goals I have outlined for myself are pretty simple:\n\nRedo my typography setup - After years and years of subtle tweaks, I ruined it. Time to start over, more fluid this time.\nNew homepage - This is the lowest priority, but nothing sings “redesign” like a new homepage.\nRemove Ads - Ads make me ~$20/mo. Originally a motivator to blog consistently, I’ve got a flow now. Ads were also an intentional third-party constraint I used to inform client work. Since I’m moving away from client work, that experiment can end.\n✅ Remove Fathom Analytics - Fathom is great, but I’m paying $5/mo to self-host and I check it zero times a year. I have Netlify’s server-side analytics running on this as well. There’s a 26× disparity between those two analytics services, enough to make me think there’s no truth to metrics at all. Jim Nielsen covers this phenomenon in his post Comparing Data in Google and Netlify Analytics.\n✅ Expose tags - I want to do a better job at tagging and categorization of posts for my own sake and I think elevating that will help.\n✅ Annual stats -  Another feature for me, I like to keep track of my progress over time.\n✅ Syntax Highlighting - I had this once with client-side Prism.js, then I took it off, now I want it back. I’m using server-side Rouge + Commonmark in Jekyll.\n✅ Support page - How can you give me $10? If I’m removing ads, might as well sell my own products and services.\n\nMy list of non-goals would include:\n\nDo not replatform the blog to Eleventy (or Astro) or whatever. I’d love to not be on Jekyll, but that’s a separate project. Tooling is a lot better on a Node stack.\nDo not go down a testing rabbit hole. Spot checks or automated webperf/accessibility tests would be beneficial, but it’d be easier on a Node stack.\nDo not automate opengraph images - Auto-generated opengraph images would be rad, but again, easier on a Node stack.\n\nWith those parameters defined, let’s do a status check…\nStatus check!\nWhat you’re looking at now is the lightly styled bones of my site. No Sass, no JavaScript, nothing but Jekyll static site compilation. I’m pleased with how the website is shaping up with basic browser defaults. I’ve got ~2.37kb of global CSS (926b gzipped) and I don’t see the need for much beyond that.\nRIP Newshammer, long live Newshammer: Astute readers will notice Newshammer is not on the site anymore. That’s not a permanent decision, but I am leaving opportunity/room to do something different.\nTypography: I’m embracing browser defaults for type right now, with two or three exceptions. I’m soft-committing to system-ui for now because I had some recent trouble rendering headings in other languages. The article H1 is the only heading I see that feels a little too small, but I’d be happy if that’s all the typesetting I need to do.\nSpacing: I have seven margin declarations and most of those are resets. Liberal usage of Grid and Flexbox using gap to manage consistent spacing. Super happy about this. Even the posts are one giant grid. I may abstract my grids into some layout utility classes…\n.layout-grid { --gap: 1.5rem; display: grid; gap: var(--gap); }\n.layout-grid > * { min-width: 0; } /* https://daverupert.com/2017/09/breaking-the-grid/ */\n.layout-grid[data-vibe=\"compact\"]     { --gap: 0.75rem }\n.layout-grid[data-vibe=\"comfortable\"] { --gap: 3rem }\n\nThis would probably remove half my existing CSS.\nCharts n’ graphs: I followed Josh Collinsworth’s post on CSS Grid bar charts for my Archive page. Happy with this. It needs some work to be fully accessible (context-less labels) but it’s presentational at its core.\nThe flagpole: One stylized component I have right now is the “flagpole” look for my Post Archives and About Timeline. I’m not attached to the flagpole treatment, but I do think visually grouping content by years is super helpful.\nBeyond that, I’ve already been able to land some accessibility fixes around my document heading structure which I’m pretty glad about. I noticed my HTML is also “over-classed” with a lot of half-baked .hentry microformats that I brought over from WordPress ten years ago, I’m looking forward to mowing those down.\nThat’s all I have for now.

When large tasks loom you don’t feel in control over your schedule and doing something you can control (like organizing your organizer) helps you feel more in control. And it did help.

There’s a table of Results I want to achieve and Metrics I’m using to gauge that progress. Overkill, I know, but it’s my overkill and it’s already helping me set some sights on personal and professional goals.\nThe biggest paradigm shift from PARA is the idea that projects have an end date. This is hard for me; a person who tends to have a lot of open-ended, never-ending projects. I’ve logged those never-ending projects like open source, podcasting, or gaming as “Areas” for now, but that feels a bit mismatched because they do require recurring participation. That said, the process has been illuminating. I’m not making major life changes yet, but it has opened my eyes to the fact that I need more “close-ended projects” in my life.\nMy Notion still needs some cleaning up but the broad strokes are working for now. I haven’t rolled this out to every digital corner, but I think this will work for at least until my next annual refactor. If you’re doing PARA in Notion, I’d love to hear about it or how you’ve modified it.\n\n\n\nPro-tip: Quarterly OKRs are working much better than Annual OKRs. ↩\n\n\n",

      "content_text": "In February, I got nerd-sniped by a mention on Twitter about a productivity system called PARA. PARA is a way to organize your digital life in to separate buckets: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.\n\nAfter watching some videos, I started applying PARA to my second brain in Notion. The timing to choose to redo my entire Notion setup was horrible, of course. I was busy with work, writing a workshop, moving ShopTalk to its own YouTube channel… why not pick up another big project and redo my entire organization system?\nThe psychology checks out though. When large tasks loom you don’t feel in control over your schedule and doing something you can control (like organizing your organizer) helps you feel more in control. And it did help. Quantifying the “Projects” I’m committed to over various “Areas” gave me a more solid perspective of what I’m doing, why I’m doing them, and when they’re due… rather than a constant state of overwhelm. I’m pleased with the results so far…\n\nInspired by Marie Poulin, I took some liberties and created a global “Task” database as well as made a dashboard for some even more meta-level “Objectives” or goals that act like personal OKRs1. There’s a table of Results I want to achieve and Metrics I’m using to gauge that progress. Overkill, I know, but it’s my overkill and it’s already helping me set some sights on personal and professional goals.\nThe biggest paradigm shift from PARA is the idea that projects have an end date. This is hard for me; a person who tends to have a lot of open-ended, never-ending projects. I’ve logged those never-ending projects like open source, podcasting, or gaming as “Areas” for now, but that feels a bit mismatched because they do require recurring participation. That said, the process has been illuminating. I’m not making major life changes yet, but it has opened my eyes to the fact that I need more “close-ended projects” in my life.\nMy Notion still needs some cleaning up but the broad strokes are working for now. I haven’t rolled this out to every digital corner, but I think this will work for at least until my next annual refactor. If you’re doing PARA in Notion, I’d love to hear about it or how you’ve modified it.\n\n\n\nPro-tip: Quarterly OKRs are working much better than Annual OKRs. ↩\n\n\n",

Coworkers are often too busy to keep track of what’s going on with engineering work, even if it’s their job to know what’s going on with engineering work. It’s generally not out of malice or lack of interest, but a lack of time and energy to chase down every issue or conversation thread. And to be fair, engineering is an opaque process where we trick the rocks inside a computer to act like a business.\nStandups are a great tool for sharing visibility. Unfortunately, not everyone loves standups. I’ve personally experienced some extremely toxic scrum master situations. Impersonal bots can have the same effect. A daily status report can feel like micromangement leading to a loss of autonomy. Also, that visibility into your work evaporates after attendees leave the call.\nFor the past four or five years, I’ve been practicing an alternative to daily standups. Rather than waiting for people to confront you, I find it better to proactively share your progress in a brief bulleted list1 in a public channel (of appropriate level). That’s the secret: share without being asked.

It’s basically a standup in newsletter form. It could be the years working in a Japanese office talking, but I don’t hate standups. They are great for mind-melding.

      "summary": "This week I finished my Frontend Masters Web Components Course. To market it celebrate that accomplishment, I wanted to share ~7 tips and tricks I’ve learned preparing my course or I feel aren’t super obvious about Web Components.\n1. You can manipulate props right on a Lit element\nThis may be something only I would do, but if you make an element with Lit that exposes its properties, you can edit those props externally using querySelector.\n<my-counter counter=\"3\"></my-counter>\n\n<script>\nconst myCounter = document.querySelector('my-counter')\nmyCounter.counter = 10\n</script>\n\n2. :host-context let’s you style an element based on its parent\nYou can use :host-context() to style an element based on its parent. Your HTML may look like this:\n<my-element></my-element>\n<div class=\"card\"><my-element></my-element></div>\n\nIn your CSS inside the Web Component, you have something like this:\n:host-context(.card) { background:pink; }\n:host-context(.card)::after { content: 'I’m in a card' }\n\nSee Example\n3. Declarative ShadowDOM\n<my-element>\n\t<template shadowroot=\"open\">\n\t  <p>I'm a spooky skeleton screen 💀</p>\n\t</template>\n</my-element>\n\nDeclarative Shadow DOM enables server-side rendering of Web Components, but one thing that’s not clear is your inlined template and the components actual template can be totally different.\nSee Example\n4. Open WC has a project starter\nIf you’re looking for a create-react-app for Web Components, the folks at Open WC have you covered.\nnpm init @open-wc\n\nYou get so much from this (local server, testing configs, a storybook, production rollup config, etc) but my favorite bit is from the sample component’s test file: it runs an accessibility audit on your Shadow DOM!\nit('passes the a11y audit', async () => {\n  const el = await fixture(html`<custom-element></custom-element>`);\n\n  await expect(el).shadowDom.to.be.accessible();\n});\n\nAccessibility out of the box! Nice.\n5. You can “rebrand” other people’s components.\nWant to mix and match components from different design systems but keep a consistent naming structure in your company? You can import a component and “rebrand” it or even add functionality.\nimport { CoolButton } from 'cool-design-system'\n\nclass OurButton extends CoolButton {\n\tconstructor { super() }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('our-button', OurButton)\n\n6. The Open WC Publishing Guides are cool\nThe OpenWC group also has some nice community guidelines for publishing Web Components.\n\n✅ Do publish latest standard EcmaScript\n✅ Do publish standard es modules\n✅ Do include \"main\": \"index.js\" and \"module\": \"index.js\" in your package.json\n✅ Do export element classes\n✅ Do export side effects separately\n✅ Do import 3rd party node modules with “bare” import specifiers\n✅ Do include file extensions in import specifiers\n❌ Do not optimize\n❌ Do not bundle\n❌ Do not minify\n❌ Do not use .mjs file extensions\n❌ Do not import polyfills\n\nThat’s helpful and hopefully provides a consistent experience, allowing for a consistent bundling story, and preventing weird footguns that might occur when trying to use other people’s Web Components in your project.\n7. You don’t need build tools until the very, very end.\nIf you want to write Web Components, you can write vanilla web components and use ES Modules to join them together. You can use a web component library like Lit with an import statement pointed at skypack.dev or unpkg.com. It’s super handy to get started with zero tooling.\nIf you want to install packages off of npm … you could try Import Maps … but otherwise you’ll need a local dev server (vite or @web/dev-server) that supports “bare import specifiers”.\nIt’s only when going to production that you need tooling specific to your site’s needs. TypeScript is optional, bundling is optional, minifying code is optional. From a Web Component perspective, these are all considered “application-level concerns” that happen at deployment time.\nRollup build script examples are out there, but Web Components don’t prescribe how to build your application, they don’t hitch you to an architecture. It could be a whole tree-shaken SPA (single page app), but Web Components also work well in a MPA (multi-page app) architecture. It’s up to you and your application to figure out what fits best.\nStay tuned for more Web Component content\nIf you want more Web Component content, stay tuned! I learned a bunch and it feels worth it to share. Also, if you’re a visual learner, my Frontend Masters course should be up soon so keep a look out over there, I’ll also post about it here, don’t worry 😉",

Open WC has a project starter\nIf you’re looking for a create-react-app for Web Components, the folks at Open WC have you covered.\nnpm init @open-wc\n\nYou get so much from this (local server, testing configs, a storybook, production rollup config, etc) but my favorite bit is from the sample component’s test file: it runs an accessibility audit on your Shadow DOM!\nit('passes the a11y audit', async () => {\n  const el = await fixture(html`<custom-element></custom-element>`);\n\n  await expect(el).shadowDom.to.be.accessible();\n});\n\nAccessibility out of the box! Nice.\n5. You can “rebrand” other people’s components.\nWant to mix and match components from different design systems but keep a consistent naming structure in your company? You can import a component and “rebrand” it or even add functionality.\nimport { CoolButton } from 'cool-design-system'\n\nclass OurButton extends CoolButton {\n\tconstructor { super() }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('our-button', OurButton)\n\n6. The Open WC Publishing Guides are cool\nThe OpenWC group also has some nice community guidelines for publishing Web Components.\n\n✅ Do publish latest standard EcmaScript\n✅ Do publish standard es modules\n✅ Do include \"main\": \"index.js\" and \"module\": \"index.js\" in your package.json\n✅ Do export element classes\n✅ Do export side effects separately\n✅ Do import 3rd party node modules with “bare” import specifiers\n✅ Do include file extensions in import specifiers\n❌ Do not optimize\n❌ Do not bundle\n❌ Do not minify\n❌ Do not use .mjs file extensions\n❌ Do not import polyfills\n\nThat’s helpful and hopefully provides a consistent experience, allowing for a consistent bundling story, and preventing weird footguns that might occur when trying to use other people’s Web Components in your project.\n7. You don’t need build tools until the very, very end.\nIf you want to write Web Components, you can write vanilla web components and use ES Modules to join them together. You can use a web component library like Lit with an import statement pointed at skypack.dev or unpkg.com. It’s super handy to get started with zero tooling.\nIf you want to install packages off of npm … you could try Import Maps … but otherwise you’ll need a local dev server (vite or @web/dev-server) that supports “bare import specifiers”.\nIt’s only when going to production that you need tooling specific to your site’s needs. TypeScript is optional, bundling is optional, minifying code is optional. From a Web Component perspective, these are all considered “application-level concerns” that happen at deployment time.\nRollup build script examples are out there, but Web Components don’t prescribe how to build your application, they don’t hitch you to an architecture. It could be a whole tree-shaken SPA (single page app), but Web Components also work well in a MPA (multi-page app) architecture. It’s up to you and your application to figure out what fits best.\nStay tuned for more Web Component content\nIf you want more Web Component content, stay tuned! I learned a bunch and it feels worth it to share. Also, if you’re a visual learner, my Frontend Masters course should be up soon so keep a look out over there, I’ll also post about it here, don’t worry 😉",

My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts.

No. Not at all. In fact, I weigh a half pound more. My consumption habits were the same, I did nothing extravagant or different.

I feel more fit, even though no one else would know it from the outside.\nThe late flight to Phoenix\nFor Spring Break we decided to visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Phoenix. Hands down one of the worst flights of my life; a woman too drunk to fly, police to escort her, and her husband (also drunk) deciding to talk back to the police. Per FAA protocol, we all had to deplane to resolve the situation. Another lesson in how much the pandemic has effected our ability to function in society.\nBut we got there, sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac for a gate, and arrived at grandma’s house in Phoenix at 3 AM Austin time. Wrecked.\nThe kids had a great visit though. Grandparents and cousins work wonders. Cousins self-propel each other. Pools, sunshine, zoo trips, and more. My wife and I could go on long walks, look at campers, and have a couple margaritas.\nThe “time off” wasn’t as restful as I needed, due in part to some lingering obligations hanging over my head…\nWork, talks, and workshops\nIt’s a busy but important time at Luro. Onboarding new customers but also figuring out next steps in the life of our startup and evaluating a pretty big architectural change (dedicated managed instances → complete multi-tenant application). Lots of discussions and ambient stress. I fried my brain one day doing a cost-benefit analysis on Rails versus Nuxt.\nAdding on to my normal workload, I prepared a talk for An Event Apart and a workshop for Frontend Masters workshop, both on Web Components. It’s been a big year for web components and I’m happy to continue talking about them.\nI enjoy presenting. I feel like it fits within my natural range of extroversion. Talks and workshops are a lot of work though piled on a busy schedule. After years of practice, I feel like I do a decent job estimating the work required and am able to plan accordingly.\nCandidly, the one thing I don’t predict well is the cloud of stress that looms over me a month or so before an event. It’s a looming feeling of excess obligations. As much as I love doing these presentations, they add a lot to a busy schedule and even busier mind. But that impulse to say “no” to future talks conflicts with my impulse to amortize my talks as much as possible.\nOne day without caffeine\nI inadvertently attempted a caffeine fast. 10am and I hadn’t had any coffee, so I decided to try it. It did not go well. I was in bed at 4pm with a cursed headache. I went to bed with a headache. I woke up with a headache. I was grumpy, irritable, and almost deleted my whole Twitter account. It took me by surprise how awful my body reacted.\nApparently 50% of people suffer caffeine withdrawal headaches and it sort of doesn’t matter how much caffeine you have (over 200mg/day). I’m in the unlucky half. I think it’s worthwhile to break chains of addiction when they present themselves, so I may attempt a fast again but may ween myself with half-caf for a bit first before I try again.\n\n💪 Fitness\n\nClosed my rings 31 times.\nDidn’t do much pickleball.\n\n\n🧶 Crafting\n\nI made a Gundam Ground Combat Urban Type and it may be my most favorite one yet. Here’s a picture\n\n\n📖 Reading - 4 books + 2 graphic novels\n\nRun - John Lewis’s retelling of America after the Civil Rights Act and his falling out with SNCC.\nThe City of Ember - My son read The City of Ember for a book report so I read the graphic novel and it’s good. I bet the book is way better tho.\nThe Four - Scott Galloway’s look at Amazon, Apple , Facebook, and Google. I liked the first half of looking at how each of the companies operate, but lost the thread in the later chapters where the personal anecdotes started coming in.\nExpressive Design Systems - Yesenia Perez-Cruz expertly outlines what makes a good, effective design system, and also how you can add life to a design system by allowing room for customization (or “seasons”). Great read.\nWhat White People Can Do Next - This one might be controversial, but sort of comes to the conclusion allyship is not the answer 😱  - the crux of the argument is that coalition building is a lot more effective and doesn’t reinforce white savior or victim tropes. I enjoyed the book and I’d be curious to hear what others thought.\nCubed - This book is so good! It’s the history of the modern workplace. I’m enjoying this book so much it’s taking twice as long to get through because I’m taking notes.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime\n\nRanking of Kings (Crunchyroll) - The story of young prince Bojji inheriting the throne of his warrior father… but Bojji is deaf, mute, and can’t swing a sword. How will he ever become king?\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nOlli Olli World\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes\n\nSpacing in Design Systems\nShopTalkShow has a vanity URL on YouTube now: https://www.youtube.com/shoptalkshow\n\n\n📝 Blogging - 2 posts this month. I still have lots of drafts, but I got sideswiped by other work obligations.\n\nGoodbye, Big Freeda - a eulogy for my old camper\nDifferent people, different ways - another songcatching post about an old Buffy Sainte Marie song from Sesame Street that we use in parenting our kids.\nI’ve also decided to redesign my blog at some point. Will need to be after the workshops and talks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically there are two days where I was one tick off on my stand goal (Mar 27) and one minute off on my workout goal (Mar 29). I’m not going to beat myself up about it. ↩\n\n\n",

      "content_text": "March came and gone. I chased fitness. We went on Spring Break. Growing a business. Baseball games. Failed on blogging. Here is a retelling of the vibes.\nClosing my rings\nThis month I decided I would undergo a challenge to close my rings on my Apple Watch every single day for the whole month and I succeeded!1\n\n\n\n\nIt’s safe to say this hasn’t ever happened. My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts. As far as workout programs go, I appreciate the body diversity in Apple Fitness+ — it’s not a bunch of yoga thin hard bodies yelling at me to touch my toes to my ears, it’s real people.\nDid it make a difference in my weight? No. Not at all. In fact, I weigh a half pound more. My consumption habits were the same, I did nothing extravagant or different. Not much to glean except that I believe this experiment showed me that my weight is not a function of exercise, even 10x my normal exercise doesn’t make a difference.\nThe best thing about the last month is that I’ve carved a bit of a routine into my life. Made some space for me. I have a good sense of what it takes to close my rings each day and it feels sustainable. I feel more fit, even though no one else would know it from the outside.\nThe late flight to Phoenix\nFor Spring Break we decided to visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Phoenix. Hands down one of the worst flights of my life; a woman too drunk to fly, police to escort her, and her husband (also drunk) deciding to talk back to the police. Per FAA protocol, we all had to deplane to resolve the situation. Another lesson in how much the pandemic has effected our ability to function in society.\nBut we got there, sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac for a gate, and arrived at grandma’s house in Phoenix at 3 AM Austin time. Wrecked.\nThe kids had a great visit though. Grandparents and cousins work wonders. Cousins self-propel each other. Pools, sunshine, zoo trips, and more. My wife and I could go on long walks, look at campers, and have a couple margaritas.\nThe “time off” wasn’t as restful as I needed, due in part to some lingering obligations hanging over my head…\nWork, talks, and workshops\nIt’s a busy but important time at Luro. Onboarding new customers but also figuring out next steps in the life of our startup and evaluating a pretty big architectural change (dedicated managed instances → complete multi-tenant application). Lots of discussions and ambient stress. I fried my brain one day doing a cost-benefit analysis on Rails versus Nuxt.\nAdding on to my normal workload, I prepared a talk for An Event Apart and a workshop for Frontend Masters workshop, both on Web Components. It’s been a big year for web components and I’m happy to continue talking about them.\nI enjoy presenting. I feel like it fits within my natural range of extroversion. Talks and workshops are a lot of work though piled on a busy schedule. After years of practice, I feel like I do a decent job estimating the work required and am able to plan accordingly.\nCandidly, the one thing I don’t predict well is the cloud of stress that looms over me a month or so before an event. It’s a looming feeling of excess obligations. As much as I love doing these presentations, they add a lot to a busy schedule and even busier mind. But that impulse to say “no” to future talks conflicts with my impulse to amortize my talks as much as possible.\nOne day without caffeine\nI inadvertently attempted a caffeine fast. 10am and I hadn’t had any coffee, so I decided to try it. It did not go well. I was in bed at 4pm with a cursed headache. I went to bed with a headache. I woke up with a headache. I was grumpy, irritable, and almost deleted my whole Twitter account. It took me by surprise how awful my body reacted.\nApparently 50% of people suffer caffeine withdrawal headaches and it sort of doesn’t matter how much caffeine you have (over 200mg/day). I’m in the unlucky half. I think it’s worthwhile to break chains of addiction when they present themselves, so I may attempt a fast again but may ween myself with half-caf for a bit first before I try again.\n\n💪 Fitness\n\nClosed my rings 31 times.\nDidn’t do much pickleball.\n\n\n🧶 Crafting\n\nI made a Gundam Ground Combat Urban Type and it may be my most favorite one yet. Here’s a picture\n\n\n📖 Reading - 4 books + 2 graphic novels\n\nRun - John Lewis’s retelling of America after the Civil Rights Act and his falling out with SNCC.\nThe City of Ember - My son read The City of Ember for a book report so I read the graphic novel and it’s good. I bet the book is way better tho.\nThe Four - Scott Galloway’s look at Amazon, Apple , Facebook, and Google. I liked the first half of looking at how each of the companies operate, but lost the thread in the later chapters where the personal anecdotes started coming in.\nExpressive Design Systems - Yesenia Perez-Cruz expertly outlines what makes a good, effective design system, and also how you can add life to a design system by allowing room for customization (or “seasons”). Great read.\nWhat White People Can Do Next - This one might be controversial, but sort of comes to the conclusion allyship is not the answer 😱  - the crux of the argument is that coalition building is a lot more effective and doesn’t reinforce white savior or victim tropes. I enjoyed the book and I’d be curious to hear what others thought.\nCubed - This book is so good! It’s the history of the modern workplace. I’m enjoying this book so much it’s taking twice as long to get through because I’m taking notes.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime\n\nRanking of Kings (Crunchyroll) - The story of young prince Bojji inheriting the throne of his warrior father… but Bojji is deaf, mute, and can’t swing a sword. How will he ever become king?\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nOlli Olli World\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes\n\nSpacing in Design Systems\nShopTalkShow has a vanity URL on YouTube now: https://www.youtube.com/shoptalkshow\n\n\n📝 Blogging - 2 posts this month.

      "summary": "February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.\nSurvived the freeze\nTexas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.\nSold the pop-up\n\nOver Valentine’s weekend, we tried to go camping with our friends, but the pop-up… didn’t… pop-up. We abandoned it at the campsite overnight and drove it to the RV lot the next day where we sold it for next to nothing. We could have put money into it and potentially sold it for more, but we needed out. It cost us ~$500 in maintenance every time we wanted to take it out and that caused me more stress than relaxation. Lots of memories, but a new chapter in camping begins… but not jumping back into the camper ownership game too soon.\nGunpla and mechanical keyboard crafting\nI made two crafts this month that I’m pleased with, but also some mixed reviews.\nXXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms\n\nA Gundam but with extra guns, the XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms. This was my first High Grade (HG) 1/144th scale gunpla. It’s a cool model with lots of expression but I was initially a bit disappointed by a wobbly waist and a leg that kept falling off. Between meetings one day I decided to rebuild the legs, found the place where I messed up, and now it’s sturdy-gurdy and much more enjoyable.\nI bought another HG model I plan on doing but am feeling the itch to go up to a Master Grade (MG) 1/100th scale model. In the meantime, I’m going to try my hand at panel lining (I bought ~$30 worth of markers!) to add some depth to my current models.\nKBDfans Mountain Ergo\n\nOn an impulse I bought the KBDfans Mountain Ergo keyboard kit. It’s an Alice-like layout (split, but staggard layout) but the tented chassis makes it a bit more ergonomic. ~$500 is a lot for a keyboard, but I regretted missing the group buy, so I impulsively bought it when restock units went on sale.\nSuch a satisfying build. The sandwiched base-plate layers, the snap and click as switches lock in to the hotswappable circuit board, and thocky keypresses of lubed stabilizers. Finished off with a (cheap) set of all-white Japanese hiragana keycaps. It’s an absolute unit and weighs more than a newborn child.\nI may post a more in-depth review, but as good and beautiful as this keyboard is… I like my Moonlander better? Or I had the Moonlander tuned a bit more ergonomically for me? It’s nice to type on though, but I think my problems are more related to 60% keyboard layouts being suboptimal for development.\nFrontend Masters Web Components Workshop\nMost February evenings went to putting together a Web Components course for Frontend Masters. I planned the workshop, made a website, and got feedback from friends in the ShopTalk Discord. Workshops aren’t my forté, but it’s coming together and feels good to be ahead of schedule rather than scrambling as the deadline approaches.\nI’m also updating my web component talk for An Event Apart: Spring Summit, so all the web component research parlays together nicely. There’s a sense of accomplishment in having turned a talk into a workshop and a website. Who knows what’s next, a book? A graphic novel? A movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Time will tell.\nLuro 📈\nAnother great month of progress on Luro. We began onboarding our first customer which brought up a lot of major and minor issues with the application, nearly tripling the number of issues in the backlog. Expected, of course, but it triggered a need for better issue management (projects, labels, etc) and taking time to triage incoming issues rather than letting them remain in memory.\nWe went with GitHub’s new beta Projects feature.

      "title": "The 15 minute fix vs the 30 day fix",
      "summary": "Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\n\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\n\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.\nThe 30 day fix\nThe 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.\nThere’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.\nBut… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.\n30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.\nExample: The case of the evolving API needs\nI built an API to retrieve posts from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.\nGET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n\nBut when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of post.title and post.id fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThen we needed to have a category filter on the /posts/lists endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThis worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these /posts/list/:category queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a limit as a query param.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nAhh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need orderBy and groupBy params for sorting, include params for an ad-hoc JOIN of related records, ability to sort JOIN records; a little less rigidity in the design.\nWe — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation. With all the added options, the /posts/list endpoint is a mess — it may not even need to exist! — and we could solve a lot of problems by sitting down and thinking about the solution a little bit harder. But I actually don’t know if we made a mistake. We were running towards getting feedback. We don’t need a big infrastructure project when sandbags would fix the issue.\nTo build or over-build, that is the question\nIt’s a tough situation that comes down to estimating. Not estimating in a “choose some fake fibonacci numbers” sense, but in an overcoming personal biases sense. Are you over-estimating your need for the 30 day fix? Are you under-estimating how well the 15 minute fix is going to work? Are you operating emotionally out of a bad experience from a previous situation? Have you overcome your personal optimism bias? What’s the pressure from management like?\nOften you don’t know the scope of the problem until you have users, so over-building at the beginning of the process is probably a mistake. The 15 minute fix gets you closer to actually learning what your codebase needs. But months down the line, you have a codebase full of 15 minute fixes that now need 30 day upgrades. Time-bombs. Could you have saved time by architecting the 30 day fix from the beginning? Or could you have saved a lot of money by chipping away at the problem with more and more 15 minute fixes?\nAnd that’s what it comes down to: economics. A 15 minute fix and a 30 day fix have colossally different costs and impacts. Can your business afford that time? Can your users afford the delay? Is it a Monty Hall Rewrite problem where the fix could actually be worse once it’s landed? I struggle with this because I hate rework, but if you think of software as evolving, then rework and maintenance is part of the job.\nHow do you decide? I don’t know. The best advice I have is: Never go to the grocery store when you’re hungry… but y’know, for software.",

      "content_text": "Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\n\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\n\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.\nThe 30 day fix\nThe 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.\nThere’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.\nBut… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.\n30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.\nExample: The case of the evolving API needs\nI built an API to retrieve posts from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.\nGET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n\nBut when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of post.title and post.id fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThen we needed to have a category filter on the /posts/lists endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThis worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these /posts/list/:category queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a limit as a query param.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nAhh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need orderBy and groupBy params for sorting, include params for an ad-hoc JOIN of related records, ability to sort JOIN records; a little less rigidity in the design.\nWe — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation.
