It’s crazy to see where this project is now compared to when I started: I always read a lot of resources and missed some sort of summary. Back then, I was blogging more often myself and so I just published my first summary on my blog. Quickly after, I realized that this makes more sense for many people to get it via email and I started using TinyLetter for my first 12 subscribers. It grew quickly to about 100 subscribers and then onwards to 500. At some point Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine asked me whether I wanted to publish the summaries on their site as well and I agreed. This gave the project a huge boost and I had to switch to the self-hosted Mailcoach + Amazon SES sending service which served me well until this year. Today I send out the mails via Mailcoach and SES to 19k subscribers. I’d never thought this would reach so many people and am humbled by the feedback and reviews I get. Over time, my own focus changed a bit but writing this newsletter is still fun and I want to do this for many more editions. \nOne last thing: I rely fully on your financial support with this project so if you can give something back from time to time, I appreciate it a lot.\nI hope you enjoy my work on this and now will give you another few articles I found interesting to read the past weeks:\nNews\n\n\tIt feels like there was a shift in the development of WebKit and Safari.

Everyone who heard or worked with PHP surely heard how awful PHP is from other people. But then, why is most of the web powered by PHP, even some of the largest platforms like Facebook?     It’s a very powerful, professional language with a huge ecosystem and it can be used to serve fast, efficient, reliable and readable codebases. I’ve seen a couple of Python services, node.js services and others that were quite inefficient and I’ve myself built a lot of websites and even some platforms with PHP that were blazing fast while serving a lot of customers. It’s always about how you use a language and how you plan (architect) a platform.\n\tI couldn’t agree more to Bramus here that dark mode toggles should be a feature of the browser, not by the website.

I think it should be easier than that to style button-like elements (something like a :button / :form-action universal selector?).\n\tThis is a short and nice example of CSS evolving over the years: A short code for a centered, flexible container where used to write media queries and hacky code before.\n\tThis article gives us another example of all the helpful CSS stuff which comes to web browsers very soon.

I really like the article because it’s honest and well documented but at the same time open for options, individual choice and not too subjective or suggestive.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tElizabeth Alli shares how to think in a conditional logic when planning, designing and coding UI components to improve the user experience. It’s applicable to every blog but even more important once you try to collect user data for your website.\n\tMega menus are quite common and improved navigation for users a lot on many bigger websites. But Vitaly Friedman now comes up with a new approach with better guidance: Navigation queries.\n\tGoogle presents its new Material Symbols, a nice icon set.

A great example how great native browser/platform features are often overlooked by developers.\n\tThis is an interesting collection of JavaScript features all engineers who work with the language should at least be aware of or know. So it’s a great reminder or learning go to to improve your JS-skills: 33 JavaScript concepts you should know.\n\tThe folks from Google Chrome labs published an open source custom element that allows you to easily put a Dark Mode 🌒 toggle or switch on your site. It initially adheres the users' preferences according to prefers-color-scheme, but allows them  override their system setting.\n\tWith more and more interactive and JS-driven web apps out there this piece of code made me cheer: performance.navigation.type === 1 can be used to find out when a user reloaded your website in the browser. This may be a hint that something broke and the user had to »turn it off and on again«. Of course it’s just one metric but an important and helpful step to debug while easy to implement.\n\tRallly is a free group meeting scheduling tool built with Next.js, Prisma & TailwindCSS. Great self-hosted alternative to the not very cheap services out there.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAhmad Shadeed shares insights into when and how to use the new :has() parent selector in CSS. It’s a great blink into the future of CSS coding but right now only Safari ships it (and Chrome behind flag).\n\tOof, what happens lately in CSS is crazy: There’s a proposal for CSS Toggles which would become incredibly useful with modern platform features such as dark/light mode or reduced motion and more toggle settings. While we currently have media queries for this, it can get quite complex and annoying to write. Toggles try to solve this in an elegant way.\n\tAdrian Roselli shares how to easily create an accessible, flexible, collapsible multiselect field with simple HTML and CSS only.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\t\nToday is my birthday. I turn 70. I’ve learned a few things so far that might be helpful to others. For the past few years, I’ve jotted down bits of unsolicited advice each year and much to my surprise I have more to add this year. So here is my birthday gift to you all: 103 bits of wisdom I wish I had known when I was young. — Kevin Kelly\n\n\n\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute here. Thank you!Anselm",

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nthis week’s links are quite interesting: A couple of web standard (proposals) that would make CSS easier again like CSS Toggles, easy progressive enhancement for form data using the web platform. But also things like a huge list of JavaScript concepts to enhance your knowledge, or simple multi-select fields without a UI library. And then, self-hosted apps seem to become more popular again as rally or planby, two open source planning/meeting/schedule tools show us. It’s always fun to collect the links for my newsletter and shows how diverse web development is. And finally, the tips from Kevin Kelly on how to see and live life are a great inspiration to become a calmer, nicer and more focused person valued in a community.\nGeneric\n\n\tTaylor Hunt says I’m not smart enough for a SPA and brings up great points on when an SPA isn’t well suited or too complex, too slow, too insecure and when to still consider it for a project. I really like the article because it’s honest and well documented but at the same time open for options, individual choice and not too subjective or suggestive.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tElizabeth Alli shares how to think in a conditional logic when planning, designing and coding UI components to improve the user experience. It’s applicable to every blog but even more important once you try to collect user data for your website.\n\tMega menus are quite common and improved navigation for users a lot on many bigger websites. But Vitaly Friedman now comes up with a new approach with better guidance: Navigation queries.\n\tGoogle presents its new Material Symbols, a nice icon set. Weirdly, it seems only available as webfont.\n\nTooling\n\n\tRegex-Vis is a super nice visual editor and tester for your regular expressions.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tPlanby is a React based component for a quick implementation of EPG, schedules, and event timelines that works interactively and very smooth.\n\tBramus Van Damme shares how to code better form validations and interactions in JavaScript using the native FormData method which progressively enhances the form automatically and with little effort. A great example how great native browser/platform features are often overlooked by developers.\n\tThis is an interesting collection of JavaScript features all engineers who work with the language should at least be aware of or know. So it’s a great reminder or learning go to to improve your JS-skills: 33 JavaScript concepts you should know.\n\tThe folks from Google Chrome labs published an open source custom element that allows you to easily put a Dark Mode 🌒 toggle or switch on your site. It initially adheres the users' preferences according to prefers-color-scheme, but allows them  override their system setting.\n\tWith more and more interactive and JS-driven web apps out there this piece of code made me cheer: performance.navigation.type === 1 can be used to find out when a user reloaded your website in the browser. This may be a hint that something broke and the user had to »turn it off and on again«. Of course it’s just one metric but an important and helpful step to debug while easy to implement.\n\tRallly is a free group meeting scheduling tool built with Next.js, Prisma & TailwindCSS. Great self-hosted alternative to the not very cheap services out there.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAhmad Shadeed shares insights into when and how to use the new :has() parent selector in CSS. It’s a great blink into the future of CSS coding but right now only Safari ships it (and Chrome behind flag).\n\tOof, what happens lately in CSS is crazy: There’s a proposal for CSS Toggles which would become incredibly useful with modern platform features such as dark/light mode or reduced motion and more toggle settings. While we currently have media queries for this, it can get quite complex and annoying to write. Toggles try to solve this in an elegant way.\n\tAdrian Roselli shares how to easily create an accessible, flexible, collapsible multiselect field with simple HTML and CSS only.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\t\nToday is my birthday. I turn 70. I’ve learned a few things so far that might be helpful to others. For the past few years, I’ve jotted down bits of unsolicited advice each year and much to my surprise I have more to add this year.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nfrom time to time my intro isn’t entirely web-focused. I always struggle a bit when this is the case because usually it’s about sensitive topics which aren’t easy to discuss in public but this is a personal newsletter. And you can always skip the next paragraph. \npersonal intro\nWhen I sent out the last edition, we were in a pandemic. Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts. Things aren’t normal since two years now and I the only way I currently see is people finding an arrangement with their inner self to deal with this. Which isn’t really a solution, more a compromise. I wish you all out there a lot of strength, passion, empathy and enough energy to find your own path and solution, to build your own opinion on things. If you’re directly affected of the war situation, I send you all the best wishes and my hope is for a peaceful together in near future again. At home, we have new neighbours since two weeks — a mother with her child. We try our best to keep them in a normal life, playing and talking with them while the husband/father is in danger and far away from them.\nweb intro\nSpeaking about the web we have much nicer topics to talk about, such as new iOS/Safari 15.4 with image lazy loading, Chrome and Firefox version 100, new Roboto Serif font and how to get better at achieving your goals. But if we don’t and make an exception, even then we have a cooler option than being annoyed about ourselves and instead accept the situation. And finally I’ve been surprised this morning to read that CSS-Tricks, one of my all time favorite sites is now part of Digital Ocean and I had to give Chris who built this site a public shoutout and thank you for all what he’s done so far for the web dev community.\nNews\n\n\tBoth Chrome and Firefox will soon reach version 100. First congrats for that. But if you rely on user agent sniffing better check your code as it may break with the first three-digit version out there.\n\tiOS 15.4 has finally added icon support in the manifest, Web Push, AR, and VR experiments, being a big improvement for web apps on Apple devices. Here’s what’s new in Safari 15.4, including the <dialog> element :has() selector, Cascade Layers, new viewport units, CSP Level 3 and more.\n\tWith Safari 15.4 we’ll get accent-color everywhere and so we can style our form inputs in a nice way cross-browser.\n\tThere is a new design for one of the best – or maybe the best – websites on frontend developer resources. Make sure to check out the MDN Web Docs.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tPHP: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for modern coding standards in PHP, trying to fight all the outdated and partially wrong solutions found on the web.\n\tWhen creating REST APIs we can make so many mistakes. Therefore it is a good idea to learn some basics. Ronald Blüthl provides a good starting point to learn about REST API design.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tYou know the Roboto font family? Here’s great news: In addition to the sans-serif there’s now the serif variant of the font family and it’s pretty cool.\n\tA well-written headline, a perfectly descriptive label, or the accurate text on a button makes all the difference. Andy Hertzfeld wrote a fun little story about choosing proper text in a user interface.\n\nTooling\n\n\tThere are good reasons (e. g. security and maintainability) to keep your programming languages, operating systems, frameworks, or libraries up to date. We can check the end-of-life dates of software on a new well-documented website.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tWhat is the environmental impact of visiting a website and what part do advertising, and analytics, play? It may be up to 70%. Here’s this interesting research saying using ad blockers could save a lot of CO2.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tRupert McKay shares common ways to do sorting in JavaScript.\n\tHere’s the guide to upgrade your apps to React v18 which is soon going to be released.\n\nCSS\n\n\tDid you know you can set up wrapper width with min() and margin-inline much cleaner these days than we’re used to? See the link for the code example.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThe software development industry is growing and growing. For new software developers, it is helpful that experienced people share their learnings. Ivan Stoev teaches us seven lessons he has learned as a software engineer.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tAdam has some nice ideas on how to manage your personal goal setting with a tiny “framework”.\n\tOn the topic of personal goal setting I found this interesting thesis that you should »never set a goal that a dead person can do better than you«. It’s about setting realistic goals that we can really achieve, not like “stop eating chocolate” which is unrealistic in so many points.\n\tSo we’ve learned that we shouldn’t just buy things and we should aim for minimalism in our lives. But well, what if we still bought something in an impulse? Stop being annoyed with yourself and make the best out of it: Use the thing now that you have it and enjoy it.\n\n\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute here. Thank you!Anselm",

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nfrom time to time my intro isn’t entirely web-focused. I always struggle a bit when this is the case because usually it’s about sensitive topics which aren’t easy to discuss in public but this is a personal newsletter. And you can always skip the next paragraph. \npersonal intro\nWhen I sent out the last edition, we were in a pandemic. Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts. Things aren’t normal since two years now and I the only way I currently see is people finding an arrangement with their inner self to deal with this. Which isn’t really a solution, more a compromise. I wish you all out there a lot of strength, passion, empathy and enough energy to find your own path and solution, to build your own opinion on things. If you’re directly affected of the war situation, I send you all the best wishes and my hope is for a peaceful together in near future again. At home, we have new neighbours since two weeks — a mother with her child. We try our best to keep them in a normal life, playing and talking with them while the husband/father is in danger and far away from them.\nweb intro\nSpeaking about the web we have much nicer topics to talk about, such as new iOS/Safari 15.4 with image lazy loading, Chrome and Firefox version 100, new Roboto Serif font and how to get better at achieving your goals. But if we don’t and make an exception, even then we have a cooler option than being annoyed about ourselves and instead accept the situation. And finally I’ve been surprised this morning to read that CSS-Tricks, one of my all time favorite sites is now part of Digital Ocean and I had to give Chris who built this site a public shoutout and thank you for all what he’s done so far for the web dev community.\nNews\n\n\tBoth Chrome and Firefox will soon reach version 100.

So I wrote something down on it on my blog. WDRL itself will turn 10 next year already which amazes me when I think about it. I want to say thank you to all who subscribe to my newsletter, who support me with recommendations to others, with money contributions or other things. You’re keeping this project alive and make it a usually joyful thing to send out a new edition.\nTo close the intro and dive into the articles, I want to share this mini documentary about my work-life in which I share how I combine web development and market gardening today as well as how to protect yourself from burn-out situations:  \n\nNews\n\n\tThis month a lot changed from a legal perspective for website owners: Two court rulings now decided that both using Google Webfonts as well as Google Analytics isn’t a legitimate interest and therefore can’t be active by default. You may still use these services if you ask for permission via Cookie Banner explicitly but it fails to serve the reason to use these services. Webfonts shouldn’t be replaced only by user action and analytics that are only collecting a small portion of user data are barely useful. So in future, self-host webfonts (from a performance perspective it’s also not worse than using the service), and use an analytics provider that’s matching GDPR rules.\n\tWhat’s new in PHP in 2022? A lot, according to this article by Brent from Stitcher.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tAlan Dávalos writes about the new baseline for web development in 2022: Now that Internet Explorer seems to die really in June this year, so now we should focus on low-spec Android devices, older Safari versions or slow networks.\n\tI’m a big fan of the paradigm “choose based on the current needs”, so when I had to prototype a recent client project on a tight budget, I made a choice that I found risky but was the best for this project: Using TailwindCSS.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tDigital products increasingly often depend on design systems. How can we evolve those design systems without breaking the products themselves? Brad Frost lays out the pros and cons about whether version the whole library or individual components.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tSimon Hearne looks at some key cache scenarios and recommend the ideal headers to set. Understanding caching is still one of the harder parts of the web and often disregarded.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tMadza shares a couple of lesser known HTML attributes that nevertheless are very helpful and may reduce JavaScript overhead.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tWe should keep learning about accessibility and make it one of our top priorities. Melanie Sumner writes about why accessibility is still seen as a side issue and how we can change it.\n\tDo you know about the CSS pseudo-class :focus-visible? Pawel Grzybek explains the difference between :focus-visible and :focus.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tChris Ferdinandi shares an easier way to write if … or checks with vanilla JavaScript by using Array.includes() when we need to check multiple conditions.\n\tZach Leatherman shares a Web Component that enhances <details> elements with very useful behaviour that I also need nearly all the time using these HTML elements. For example keyboard actions, default closed on mobile but opened on big screens.\n\nCSS\n\n\tThis is a nice collection of Tailwind CSS components to use for free. But even if you don’t use Tailwind it’s a nice inspiration for building components.\n\tOne thing that often gets neglected when discussing about Tailwind’s utility class approach is that it isn’t limited to that. You can use Tailwind’s directives and functions to make use of Tailwind’s presets inside your own CSS. That could go as far as writing completely your own class references and only using the styling inside your CSS file.\n\tWonder what fit-content is suitable for? Here’s a quick guide leading you to the use cases.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tJames Clear, the author of the bestseller book Atomic Habits, reminds us of how important it is to say no if you want to stay productive, healthy, and focused.\n\tJoel Spolsky writes about difficulties with getting started at work and why it is okay to move on one step at a time.\n\tIf you work in web design or web development, this article might be an interesting read for you. Dan Mall reflects on the business of his design systems agency in 2021. He comes up with some inspiring conclusions.\n\tIn a workplace that isn’t psychologically sound, you’ll find a culture where people fear being embarrassed or blamed or publicly shamed. Adam Blanchard on psychological safety.\n\n\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute to financing the project or just forward it to your colleagues and friends or share on social media.

Understanding caching is still one of the harder parts of the web and often disregarded.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tMadza shares a couple of lesser known HTML attributes that nevertheless are very helpful and may reduce JavaScript overhead.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tWe should keep learning about accessibility and make it one of our top priorities. Melanie Sumner writes about why accessibility is still seen as a side issue and how we can change it.\n\tDo you know about the CSS pseudo-class :focus-visible? Pawel Grzybek explains the difference between :focus-visible and :focus.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tChris Ferdinandi shares an easier way to write if … or checks with vanilla JavaScript by using Array.includes() when we need to check multiple conditions.\n\tZach Leatherman shares a Web Component that enhances <details> elements with very useful behaviour that I also need nearly all the time using these HTML elements. For example keyboard actions, default closed on mobile but opened on big screens.\n\nCSS\n\n\tThis is a nice collection of Tailwind CSS components to use for free. But even if you don’t use Tailwind it’s a nice inspiration for building components.\n\tOne thing that often gets neglected when discussing about Tailwind’s utility class approach is that it isn’t limited to that. You can use Tailwind’s directives and functions to make use of Tailwind’s presets inside your own CSS. That could go as far as writing completely your own class references and only using the styling inside your CSS file.\n\tWonder what fit-content is suitable for? Here’s a quick guide leading you to the use cases.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tJames Clear, the author of the bestseller book Atomic Habits, reminds us of how important it is to say no if you want to stay productive, healthy, and focused.\n\tJoel Spolsky writes about difficulties with getting started at work and why it is okay to move on one step at a time.\n\tIf you work in web design or web development, this article might be an interesting read for you. Dan Mall reflects on the business of his design systems agency in 2021. He comes up with some inspiring conclusions.\n\tIn a workplace that isn’t psychologically sound, you’ll find a culture where people fear being embarrassed or blamed or publicly shamed. Adam Blanchard on psychological safety.\n\n\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute to financing the project or just forward it to your colleagues and friends or share on social media.

I want to say thank you to everyone here who reads or supports this project.\nThis year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time. But nature has helped me, my child has helped me, meditation and focusing on my own opinion, on my own body, on my own health helps me staying sane. A big reveal was during my Covid infection: Once I realised how “pre-informed” I was about the disease, I stripped out this bias and listened to my body instead, my health improved next day and recovery was very quick from then on while it stalled over some days before. I share this because I think it’s very important to listen to yourself, to keep track on your own health instead of being drawn down by everyday TV shows that don’t even offer any solution but only share how bad everything is.\nMy wish for the future is to empower you to be your own you. You already have the ability, now to find out how to enable it. It may not be the easiest but probably worth it.\nThere’s a new year coming and I’d love to see that more people will trust their own mind and body again and work towards this goal. Read you next year!\nNews\n\n\tDo you like or do you not like Tailwind CSS? No matter which camp we are in, we should give love and respect to Adam and the team.

So let us treat them with respect and be friendly. On November 15th, there was an amazing Safari release. Safari Tech Preview now has lazy image loading, accent-color for browser UI controls enabled by default and supports dynamic viewport units, flex-basis: content, and rel=\"noopener/noreferrer\" for form elements. Pretty cool for just one preview release, isn’t it?\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tIvaylo Gerchev shares the Vue 3 Composition API and its advantages over previous methods. If you’re using Vue, this is a cool intro and comparison what to use for which solution.\n\tUntil near future, we need to reverse an array to find values or its index in an JavaScript array which causes an array mutation and is a memory-increasing action. Luckily, there's an ECMAscript proposal for findLast and findLastIndex.\n\tRematch.js is using the best practices from Redux but without the boilerplate and it’s super tiny (2kb).

Sticky footer means the element is on the bottom of the page even if not enough content is there while not being in fixed position on the site as well.\n\tAhmad Shadeed often writes about little findings in CSS that are super useful. Such as this one where he explains why position: sticky does not work automatically with CSS Grid and how to use them in combination.\n\tIt looks like there is finally a way to animate a dynamic height using only CSS. Nelson Menezes shows us how he achieved this in a funny and interesting read.\n\tThis is a very interesting case of why it’s best to avoid !important: While you can use !important in CSS Custom Properties, it doesn’t work as we’re used to. Instead, it’s stripped from the definition by the parser but influences the CSS cascade. See the article to understand this better.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tHabits and streaks are cool but what happens usually when we miss a day and break our streak? We tend to let the habit fall completely. When things aren’t going according to plan, Practicing with Zero is simply pausing, and deciding how we want to proceed from here. With intention.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute to financing the project.

Pretty cool for just one preview release, isn’t it?\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tIvaylo Gerchev shares the Vue 3 Composition API and its advantages over previous methods. If you’re using Vue, this is a cool intro and comparison what to use for which solution.\n\tUntil near future, we need to reverse an array to find values or its index in an JavaScript array which causes an array mutation and is a memory-increasing action. Luckily, there's an ECMAscript proposal for findLast and findLastIndex.\n\tRematch.js is using the best practices from Redux but without the boilerplate and it’s super tiny (2kb). It has TypeScript support, native async/await, a simple plugin API, and needs no configuration. Usable with React, Vue, Angular or others.\n\nCSS\n\n\tA sticky footer solution by Sílvio Rosa that only needs two lines of CSS. Sticky footer means the element is on the bottom of the page even if not enough content is there while not being in fixed position on the site as well.\n\tAhmad Shadeed often writes about little findings in CSS that are super useful. Such as this one where he explains why position: sticky does not work automatically with CSS Grid and how to use them in combination.\n\tIt looks like there is finally a way to animate a dynamic height using only CSS. Nelson Menezes shows us how he achieved this in a funny and interesting read.\n\tThis is a very interesting case of why it’s best to avoid !important: While you can use !important in CSS Custom Properties, it doesn’t work as we’re used to. Instead, it’s stripped from the definition by the parser but influences the CSS cascade. See the article to understand this better.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tHabits and streaks are cool but what happens usually when we miss a day and break our streak? We tend to let the habit fall completely. When things aren’t going according to plan, Practicing with Zero is simply pausing, and deciding how we want to proceed from here. With intention.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute to financing the project.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nthanks for all the feedback that reached me last time, it was awesome to read that so many people support me even when my schedule of writing isn’t regular. Now that I had a thought on how to continue with WDRL I realised that this project won’t be sold, won’t be transferred to someone else or such thing. It’s just too personal to do this. But Malte Riechmann will help me collect and write some links from this edition on — it’s all in the early stages but I’m glad because it will help me and save me time.\nIn the past two weeks I had the chance to think about a lot of things that are influencing our lives at the moment. It made me realise that it’s upon us how we see our worlds, how we see the problems of our world. It’s our choice how we deal with other people, whether we confront people, cut them short, or whether we’re calm, interested and open minded. I know the latter is not possible all the time, but trying is really worth it. If we understand each other better, we create emotions, we can hold together, we will get stronger and happier. We can support each other in unstable situations, when we’re not sure what to do or what to believe. It’s the community that works for humans, and it’s hate and envy that boosts the bad things in life. We choose our path every day.\nTo make this easier for myself, I blocked all major news sites via pi-hole DNS for my devices again for an unlimited time. You can also set 1.1.1.2 for families as baseline and fallback.\nNews\n\n\tSafari 15 now has WebExtensions on iOS and iPadOS, supports theme-color meta tag, supports CSS aspect-ratio, new color syntaxes. The web inspector features a CSS Grid helper, ES6 modules are now supported in  Workers and ServiceWorkers. Top-level await, Error.cause, private class methods and accessors are supported, too. And more…\n\nGeneric\n\n\tPawel Grzybek explains the history of the @. It is always interesting to know where icons and signs come from. We usually cannot remember their original meaning. E. g. think about the disc icon, which often stands for save in user interfaces.\n\tWeb development is only as complex as the belonging requirements. Therefore we should thrive for simpler solutions and fewer options. Jason Fried writes about this in one of his recent blog posts.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tArco is an intelligent design system with code and design files available. Pretty cool!\n\nTooling\n\n\tWe can now go to vscode.dev with our web browsers and a lightweight version of VS Code will start. It is pretty amazing how far web development has come. We can directly begin coding without installing anything. With Chrome and Edge we can even open entire directories into the web application using the File System Access API.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tJohan Isaksson tells us how he improved a Google app’s scroll performance 10x by simply adding an old CSS table property. What does this tell us? That we as developers should always think about whether there are native HTML or CSS solutions out there instead of JavaScript.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tWithin the last few years, all of us created hamburger menus. And probably all of us made some kind of mistake while doing so. Manuel Matuzović summarizes and explains these mistakes very well. He also shows a valid, semantic, and well-structured hamburger menu.\n\tWriting and understanding semantically correct HTML is still one of the important basics in web development. Ben Myers brings to us some details on the <dl> HTML element.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tJake Archibald shares why emotions matter when writing alt text for images.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tI love simple solutions. That’s why I love this simple in-page filter search written in a few lines of plain JavaScript. A few years ago, I’ve built something similar but back then it required a few more lines and wasn’t that neat due to missing JavaScript functions.\n\tThe JavaScript console object can do so much more than console.log(). Marko Denic shows us all the different features so we can improve our JavaScript debugging and become better web developers.\n\tThese unstyled, accessible React components are nice because we just need to style them. No need to reinvent the functionality all the time.\n\nCSS\n\n\tThis article is a good reminder of how object-fit and background-size work. Ahmad Shadeed goes into detail and explains to us when and when not to use these CSS properties. He also shows us how to fix the padding hack with the CSS property aspect-ratio.\n\tStephanie Eckles explains how to style radio buttons the modern way with CSS Grid layout, currentColor, appearance and em units. No images, no weird absolute positioning or similar.\n\tWith plain CSS we can now achieve sticky section indicators in definition lists. Pretty neat and something we had to do for years with comparably complex JavaScript code.\n\tDo you know @supports can not only check on CSS properties but on CSS selectors, too? In one of his latest articles, Chris Coyier tells us all about this helpful CSS feature.\n\tWe all have used CSS hacks. Especially in the early days, those were sometimes the only solution to problems. Today we rarely see them anymore. But have a look at this interesting CSS hack from the developers at Facebook.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.\nSecurity\n\n\tJake Archibald teaches us how we win at CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This is great because it’s one of the trickier things to test, debug and grasp CORS as a developer.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tChristian Kozalla shows the proper approach to implement and style a dialog element to show a dialog/overlay/modal to a user.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tEric Eggert explains the differences between buttons and links and why we shouldn’t just use what we want to for our web apps but the proper types instead.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tLivewire is a nice technology to use in dynamic Laravel apps. Caleb Porzio shares how it works and how to use it in a deep dive article.\n\tIf you’re using Laravel already, here’s a nice alternative to the hosted services for adding a support bubble to your website.\n\tVizzu is a library for animated data visualizations and data stories. Here’s an overview of what it can do.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares how we can do conditional border-radius today but future holds a much more readable approach for us.\n\tChris Coyier shares future additions currently in development for CSS, and they’re super cool. It would allow for native nesting, container queries and units, cascade layers, @when (native if/else), and scoping. Alle we ever wished for in the past decade.\n\tDavid Hall explains how much of a difference a well crafted drop shadow makes for interaction. I love these detailed explanations of something that looks very simple.\n\tChris Coyier on the different degrees of custom property usage and why the decision how to do it fully depends on the context of the team and project we’re working in.\n\tFirst of all I’m convinced that absolute positioning in CSS has its value and its use-cases. But in many cases it also creates new problems, especially in responsive and modular contexts. So this documentation of use-cases where we don’t need absolute positioning in CSS anymore is great.\n\tMikael Ainalem shares an approach to create pop-out effects in CSS using clip-path().\n\tWe know a lot of the techniques highlighted in this article from our work as CSS developers. But gladly with new techniques we can switch away from pseudo-element hacks to more stable solutions today.\n\tThere’s a new CSS property called accent-color which makes it quick and easy to roll out global styles.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tLong time ago I wrote this piece and had the intend to let it publish somewhere else. But it didn’t happen so here it is on my personal blog: It’s time for a healthy tech approach.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tBerwyn Powell considers the impact of a web application or website on carbon emissions and how we can reduce them as developers.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.\nSecurity\n\n\tJake Archibald teaches us how we win at CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This is great because it’s one of the trickier things to test, debug and grasp CORS as a developer.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tChristian Kozalla shows the proper approach to implement and style a dialog element to show a dialog/overlay/modal to a user.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tEric Eggert explains the differences between buttons and links and why we shouldn’t just use what we want to for our web apps but the proper types instead.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tLivewire is a nice technology to use in dynamic Laravel apps. Caleb Porzio shares how it works and how to use it in a deep dive article.\n\tIf you’re using Laravel already, here’s a nice alternative to the hosted services for adding a support bubble to your website.\n\tVizzu is a library for animated data visualizations and data stories. Here’s an overview of what it can do.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares how we can do conditional border-radius today but future holds a much more readable approach for us.\n\tChris Coyier shares future additions currently in development for CSS, and they’re super cool. It would allow for native nesting, container queries and units, cascade layers, @when (native if/else), and scoping. Alle we ever wished for in the past decade.\n\tDavid Hall explains how much of a difference a well crafted drop shadow makes for interaction.

But in many cases it also creates new problems, especially in responsive and modular contexts.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nthis time we’re going to look deeply into a lot of CSS articles together with optimising images. In CSS, we get nice tools that help us create better layouts, faster. We also look at new technologies like parent selectors, like responsive images in CSS, reverting CSS settings and container queries.\nOne thing that I recognize now that I have my gardening job is that I finally am able to look at web things from a more distant perspective. Which is nice because I now don’t spend any thoughts and nerves on discussions about »native HTML« and similar things that drive Twitter’s platform and make it so negative. When reading my Twitter feed, often a little bit later than the tweets were written, so many things seem unnecessary to me. Previously, I struggled with it a lot and spent hours wasting time on topics that in reality aren’t relevant to me as a person or for our community. I learnt that what matters really is doing something for the community instead of arguing against other people’s opinions. It’s one of the reasons why I started writing the newsletter again, it’s why I organise events here in my neighbourhood nowadays.\nEnjoy your week with a smile now, no matter what your brain says. Worth a try, isn’t it?\n—Anselm\nGeneric\n\n\tWe all love regular expressions, don’t we? Here’s a guide how to write better RegExp in PHP.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tJake Archibald shares another summary of how to serve sharp images to high density screens while saving data efficiently.\n\nCSS\n\n\tChris Coyier shares the differences and use cases for inherit, initial, unset and revert properties in CSS.\n\tAhmad Shadeed shares how to make custom scrollbars in CSS the modern way. While this is very useful, don’t style them unless you really need this. Also, keep in mind the different light/dark modes and high contrast and other media queries and helpful accessibility functionality.\n\tThis layout generator lets you create and adjust CSS Grid layouts very easily with a UI.\n\tLet’s talk about Flexbox: “How can we create equal columns with Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/)? This is the best example to show why we now have Flexbox and CSS Grid but none could ever replace the other, they’re for different purposes.\n\tLayoutIt! is another layout generator for CSS Grids, a bit different in its UI than the other one mentioned in the newsletter. Both great, try them!\n\tMax Böck on media queries in times of container queries. While we’re inclined to think container queries would replace media queries in all cases, that’s not entirely true. For page layouts itself, media queries will stay the easiest and most suitable solution. For small projects where we don’t necessarily need a huge component system, they will be the go to solution. For big projects, they will play a smaller role in future.\n\tAdrian Bece explores an early draft of :has(), a CSS parent selector that may come into our browsers soon.\n\tSomeone remembers image-set() in CSS? Safari supports it since a long time, actually before we had picture support. Now Firefox added support, so we can have another look into it and check the use-cases: Responsive images in CSS.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nthis week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.\nNews\n\n\tChrome now supports the import of JSON modules.\n\tApple just announced Safari 15 that’s coming in autumn and here are the highlights: Support for HTML attribute autocomplete=one-time-code (2FA), CSS aspect-ratio, lab(), lch(), hwb() color syntaxes, theme-color meta tag supoport, and in JavaScript top level await, ES6 Modules in Service Workers and Workers, Error.cause. Apart from that a lot of privacy and security enhancements are coming as well as WebGL2, and Web Share level 2.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tA little bit of a different view that shows the benefits of auto deleting inactive users from your platform. When you do, your database will get faster, more secure, and easier to handle and administrate. In the end, inactive users make a great number but the platform itself doesn’t benefit from them. Care about those on your platform.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tFlagpack is a set of flags we can use for internationalization and languages choosers on our apps and websites. It’s open source.\n\nTooling\n\n\tHeadlessUI is a set of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS. Designed for React and Vue.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tFork is a lightweight solution for running PHP code concurrently.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tSandrina Pereira explains us how to make disabled buttons more inclusive.\n\tKitty Giraudel shares how to implement an accessible toggle component in your app.\n\tVitaly Friedman wrote up a complete guide to accessible front-end components. This is worth reading it again from time to time.\n\nCSS\n\n\tDavid Bushell argues for using start and end as syntax instead of left and right for a more universal layout language.\n\tAdam Argyle shares how to create split-text animations and word animations the proper way.\n\tJim Nielsen reveals the system colors we can use in CSS and how useful this can be for light and dark mode themes.\n\tBarry Pollard shares how we can control font loading with less impact to the rendering with the cool new CSS Font Descriptors feature.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThis is a great piece of content on how less is often more. Kent C. Dodds shares with the example of electric cars why sometimes we need to think entirely different to what we’re used to to simplify things. Electric cars need less maintenance and are easier to build because they need less parts. If we apply that to our life, or to building websites we can save ourselves from a lot of trouble.\n\tJulia Evans shares helpful advice on how to improve the relationship to your manager by telling them thing they might not know, such as why the team might be slow, what the technical debt is, what goals you may have, the extra work people in the team are doing, and more.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nthis week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.\nNews\n\n\tChrome now supports the import of JSON modules.\n\tApple just announced Safari 15 that’s coming in autumn and here are the highlights: Support for HTML attribute autocomplete=one-time-code (2FA), CSS aspect-ratio, lab(), lch(), hwb() color syntaxes, theme-color meta tag supoport, and in JavaScript top level await, ES6 Modules in Service Workers and Workers, Error.cause. Apart from that a lot of privacy and security enhancements are coming as well as WebGL2, and Web Share level 2.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tA little bit of a different view that shows the benefits of auto deleting inactive users from your platform. When you do, your database will get faster, more secure, and easier to handle and administrate. In the end, inactive users make a great number but the platform itself doesn’t benefit from them. Care about those on your platform.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tFlagpack is a set of flags we can use for internationalization and languages choosers on our apps and websites. It’s open source.\n\nTooling\n\n\tHeadlessUI is a set of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS. Designed for React and Vue.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tFork is a lightweight solution for running PHP code concurrently.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tSandrina Pereira explains us how to make disabled buttons more inclusive.\n\tKitty Giraudel shares how to implement an accessible toggle component in your app.\n\tVitaly Friedman wrote up a complete guide to accessible front-end components. This is worth reading it again from time to time.\n\nCSS\n\n\tDavid Bushell argues for using start and end as syntax instead of left and right for a more universal layout language.\n\tAdam Argyle shares how to create split-text animations and word animations the proper way.\n\tJim Nielsen reveals the system colors we can use in CSS and how useful this can be for light and dark mode themes.\n\tBarry Pollard shares how we can control font loading with less impact to the rendering with the cool new CSS Font Descriptors feature.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThis is a great piece of content on how less is often more.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nit’s been a long while and I’ll start with a big sorry to all my loyal readers over the past years. I’ve neglected this project since January this year and just now found enough time to bring it back to life. Why to life? Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget it’s a great option.\nI’m busy with my market garden business growing lots of food which works fine despite weather surprises us here again with colder than usual temperatures and lots of rain over the past weeks. But we now serve over 40 customers, which means we give food to around 80 – 100 people every week during growing period. This is an awesome feeling!\nIn parallel I spend a lot of time seeing my son grow up, playing with him. When there’s enough time I work on small website projects and try to organize an event about soil and climate action in summer here in Germany. Let’s see if it’s possible to make this event real.\nThe political and social situation we’re currently in continues to baffle me and surprise me. Mostly not in a positive way though which means I’m spending more time reflecting on my thoughts and news, meditating for my mind and to stay sane and calm. I stuggle to accept that so many people have hardline-thoughts in a specific direction, I don’t even care so much in which one. But I think we’re still individuals and every single person should be able to think on their own and decide on their own (thinking as a social, empathic being).\nNews\n\n\tSafari 14.1 is an interesting one because it’s a minor update but brings great joy for us developers: Flexbox gap support, Date & Time Inputs on macOS (woohoo!), WebM support to name the big ones.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tUna Kravets recaps the new complexity of building modern responsive designs for the web. But there’s a new player called Container Queries in the house which makes many things for us developers easier to work with a component driven system.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tSilvestar Bistrović shares useful tools for auditing CSS.\n\tBarry Pollard explains how Core Web Vitals work and what we should do as developers to get a better score by Google.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tAmber Wilson shares the love story of HTML input fields and labels. A good reminder or starter to understand how these two play well together.\n\tAdrian Roselli shows us how to easily configure <select> elements to look custom instead of choosing a library that does get accessibility or usability wrong.\n\tKitty Giraudel shares how to build a navigation. Sounds boring? Well, we probably forget a lot of the things that went into this one in our daily work.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tEver struggled to understand DOM Events and their options? Here’s DOMEvents.dev to help you understand it better with an interactive playground.\n\tParvus is an accessible, open-source image lightbox with no dependencies.\n\tAdrian Roselli shows how to build sortable table columns in an inclusive and simple way.\n\nCSS\n\n\tMax Böck had a chance to try out container queries and shares his findings, his struggles and combines them with a good real world example.\n\tThis tutorial by Ahmad Shadeed provides nice solutions for how to put text over images so it’s still readable.\n\tThe folks from Sentry built a dark mode for their app. Now they share their path of cleaning up, refactoring variables, then building a new design system and then reimplementing the styles into their components.\n\tLea Verou has an easy solution to implement dark mode by using inverted lightness variables. This is especially useful if you’re building new projects or one that already makes use of the hsl() color mode.\n\tCallum Hart shares how to name and define variables that adapt to different contexts like Chameleons do.\n\tStephanie Eckles shares the updates to CSS that improve accessibility. She explains them so we understand better when and how to use them.\n\tMatsuko from craft cms shares how to create custom focus indicators that look great in CSS.\n\tScott Kellum on why he thinks intrinsic typography is the future of styling text on the web. With detailed comparison-view examples and code suggestions he wrote a great article that’s useful for us developers.\n\tStephanie Eckles explains all the modern CSS pseudo-class selectors like :any-link, :where() and others.\n\tChris Coyier tried out the new CSS color-contrast() function that’s in the Safari preview. A pretty cool function when we’re working with variables and in different contexts.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tLeo Babauta is great at pointing out things that we all know if we think about it but we constantly forget to think about. Here’s advice for the feeling of guilt to not working more when we’re done for the day already. A habit worth integrating into our lifestyles.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nWelcome to another new year, 2021. WDRL is now seven and a half year old already and the first edition had about twenty email subscribers. What was in there? We had webfont loading behaviour, Speedcurve, a HTML validator, GrumpIcon which created PNG fallbacks for SVG icons via Grunt (remember?), and we moved away from jQuery and started using native JS functions instead. This throwback was quite interesting for me this week. Some topics are still relevant today while others have completely disappeared or solved.\nComing 2021 we now get the ability to slowly replace old hacky code for aspect-ratio with Chrome supporting it now in the latest stable (88), Firefox as well behind flags and in Safari Tech Preview.

We still don’t know how to deal with the new kinds of diseases short and long-term. We still have no real clue and conclusion how to save our planet (means us humans, the planet will survive). Many of us now are in a state of uncertainty, of frustration, of stress. Working remotely isn’t easy for all of us, the split between childcare and work is hard,  and our social contacts have been reduced to the minimum. That’s definitely not a combination that makes our lives easy, calm and ourselves happy. That’s why I found this writing so useful: News is the last thing we need right now but it’s addictive like a drug. Reading this made me finally block all the major news sites. I’m already two weeks in, and it feels quite good. And fear not, it’s not that I don’t know about the important news, there are still enough ways to get them from other people. It’s simply that you don’t fetch them actively and don’t fall into the trap of getting caught by another handful of articles. \nI hope you all can enjoy the end of the year, make it a calm and nice time despite of all the things happening all over the world, despite all the articles here, all the news around us and all the other people sharing their fears, their concerns and annoyances with us. Let’s try to reframe it, show empathy, listen to people and try to understand them. Read you in 2021 again, thanks for everything to you, your support, your money gifts, your article suggestions, your conversations via email. I’m really grateful for this audience.\nGeneric\n\n\tEric Bailey on how we can create more eco-friendly websites. Some pretty handy tricks in there, some very simple ones, some that can’t be applied to every project.\n\tAVIF, the file format based on the AV1 video codec, is the latest addition to the next-gen image formats. Now this article shares a couple of things we should know before we blindly use this new format for everything. WebP, for example, performs better for thumbnails, and if the picture has a high entropy, JPEG can still deliver better results at a smaller size. Funnily, JPEG2000 which never kicked off really still challenges most of the other formats today. And if you’re now unsure what to do, using mozJPEG is still one of the best compromises you can use today.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAdam Silver shares why we should be more careful designing tab styles for use cases that aren’t or shouldn’t be tabs.\n\tScale is a nice set of illustrations for free, even for commercial projects. The nice thing? You can set the main color easily in the SVG and adapt them to your brand color.\n\nTooling\n\n\tBlurhash is a nice library that creates blurs for image placeholders. Now here’s alos a pure PHP implementation of it.\n\tPlaiceholder is a simple online tool where you can upload an image and get a CSS, SVG, Base64, Blurhash, or React element that acts as blur placeholder until the real image is loaded. A nice tool for when you just need this a once or a couple of times.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tKilian Valkhof shares concepts and examples of how we can integrate the prefers-reduced-data setting into our websites. With it, we can disable web font loading, not load background images, or using picture and its media query attribute to load smaller images than normal. We can even prevent preloading or autoplay of videos, disable infinite scrolling preloads (we could improve the example using IntersectionObserver). It’s super cool to see these practical implementations which don’t even require much effort but have a huge benefit to users with a limited data budget (international roaming, etc).\n\tJames Ross shares how we can use Cloudflare Workers and CSS to deliver new image formats like AVIF. It’s pretty cool that James has some real use cases here and even shows the real life impact data.\n\tNoam Rosenthal on how they made their Wikipedia page previews fast. A nice insight into JavaScript’s heavy functions and how to easily or not replace them.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tRobin Rendle explores what we can do with the <details>/<summary> elements in HTML and CSS. Ever thought that we could de-animate (pause) a gif? We can do inline-block footnotes or build tooltips with it!\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tJeremy Keith created a simple gist to save form input via localStorage to avoid content being lost when something happens to the client browser or the server resets the connection due to security.\n\nCSS\n\n\tEver tried to build a visual calendar with CSS? You may end up with tables and styling a lot of things. What’s much simpler is now that we have CSS Grid using this cool technology to build a basic calendar in three lines of CSS.\n\tIf you want to have a clickable card interface, things can easily get tricky due to the fact that we can’t nest links in HTML. Christian Heilmann shares a way how to do it the right way but always keep in mind that UX and accessibility may still be impacted by this design pattern which is why nested links aren’t a native thing in HTML.\n\tBramus Van Damme writes how to use the new aspect-ratio CSS property in browsers to replace these ugly padding-top hacks we used to apply to iframe embeds. Unfortunately, this is not baked into stable browsers yet but we can already use the setting and later strip the fallbacks from the codebase.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIt makes me really happy to see such an amazing project: Field Notes: Snowmaker. A story how to make 99999 unique snow flakes. My dream? Brendan (or someone else) is allowed and paid for drawing all these snow flakes by hand. Nature is amazing, craft is amazing and we should embrace it. Thanks Field Notes for doing this project.\n\n\nThank you for reading this. I hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nIt’s nearly the end of the year and the world is still different than we could imagine before 2020. We still don’t know how to deal with the new kinds of diseases short and long-term. We still have no real clue and conclusion how to save our planet (means us humans, the planet will survive). Many of us now are in a state of uncertainty, of frustration, of stress. Working remotely isn’t easy for all of us, the split between childcare and work is hard,  and our social contacts have been reduced to the minimum. That’s definitely not a combination that makes our lives easy, calm and ourselves happy. That’s why I found this writing so useful: News is the last thing we need right now but it’s addictive like a drug. Reading this made me finally block all the major news sites. I’m already two weeks in, and it feels quite good. And fear not, it’s not that I don’t know about the important news, there are still enough ways to get them from other people. It’s simply that you don’t fetch them actively and don’t fall into the trap of getting caught by another handful of articles. \nI hope you all can enjoy the end of the year, make it a calm and nice time despite of all the things happening all over the world, despite all the articles here, all the news around us and all the other people sharing their fears, their concerns and annoyances with us. Let’s try to reframe it, show empathy, listen to people and try to understand them. Read you in 2021 again, thanks for everything to you, your support, your money gifts, your article suggestions, your conversations via email. I’m really grateful for this audience.\nGeneric\n\n\tEric Bailey on how we can create more eco-friendly websites. Some pretty handy tricks in there, some very simple ones, some that can’t be applied to every project.\n\tAVIF, the file format based on the AV1 video codec, is the latest addition to the next-gen image formats. Now this article shares a couple of things we should know before we blindly use this new format for everything. WebP, for example, performs better for thumbnails, and if the picture has a high entropy, JPEG can still deliver better results at a smaller size. Funnily, JPEG2000 which never kicked off really still challenges most of the other formats today. And if you’re now unsure what to do, using mozJPEG is still one of the best compromises you can use today.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAdam Silver shares why we should be more careful designing tab styles for use cases that aren’t or shouldn’t be tabs.\n\tScale is a nice set of illustrations for free, even for commercial projects. The nice thing? You can set the main color easily in the SVG and adapt them to your brand color.\n\nTooling\n\n\tBlurhash is a nice library that creates blurs for image placeholders. Now here’s alos a pure PHP implementation of it.\n\tPlaiceholder is a simple online tool where you can upload an image and get a CSS, SVG, Base64, Blurhash, or React element that acts as blur placeholder until the real image is loaded. A nice tool for when you just need this a once or a couple of times.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tKilian Valkhof shares concepts and examples of how we can integrate the prefers-reduced-data setting into our websites. With it, we can disable web font loading, not load background images, or using picture and its media query attribute to load smaller images than normal. We can even prevent preloading or autoplay of videos, disable infinite scrolling preloads (we could improve the example using IntersectionObserver). It’s super cool to see these practical implementations which don’t even require much effort but have a huge benefit to users with a limited data budget (international roaming, etc).\n\tJames Ross shares how we can use Cloudflare Workers and CSS to deliver new image formats like AVIF. It’s pretty cool that James has some real use cases here and even shows the real life impact data.\n\tNoam Rosenthal on how they made their Wikipedia page previews fast. A nice insight into JavaScript’s heavy functions and how to easily or not replace them.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tRobin Rendle explores what we can do with the <details>/<summary> elements in HTML and CSS. Ever thought that we could de-animate (pause) a gif? We can do inline-block footnotes or build tooltips with it!\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tJeremy Keith created a simple gist to save form input via localStorage to avoid content being lost when something happens to the client browser or the server resets the connection due to security.\n\nCSS\n\n\tEver tried to build a visual calendar with CSS? You may end up with tables and styling a lot of things. What’s much simpler is now that we have CSS Grid using this cool technology to build a basic calendar in three lines of CSS.\n\tIf you want to have a clickable card interface, things can easily get tricky due to the fact that we can’t nest links in HTML. Christian Heilmann shares a way how to do it the right way but always keep in mind that UX and accessibility may still be impacted by this design pattern which is why nested links aren’t a native thing in HTML.\n\tBramus Van Damme writes how to use the new aspect-ratio CSS property in browsers to replace these ugly padding-top hacks we used to apply to iframe embeds. Unfortunately, this is not baked into stable browsers yet but we can already use the setting and later strip the fallbacks from the codebase.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIt makes me really happy to see such an amazing project: Field Notes: Snowmaker. A story how to make 99999 unique snow flakes. My dream? Brendan (or someone else) is allowed and paid for drawing all these snow flakes by hand. Nature is amazing, craft is amazing and we should embrace it. Thanks Field Notes for doing this project.\n\n\nThank you for reading this. I hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nNow there we go with a new writing. For me, this year has been quite different so far. And no, this is mostly not about some virus spreading across the world but about changing a lot in my work and personal life. My son keeps teaching me new skills, patience, happiness. My gardening project went well the first year and we’re scaling it next year so we can grow vegetables for more than 70 people. Not to stop here, we created a network for workshops and events where local people share their knowledge to improve farming, gardening and live a more resilient and sustainable life as humans.\nOn the other hand, being away from client work for half a year was incredibly useful. I now have a different view on some projects again, I refocused on what’s important in projects and got away from just coding and first ask about the goals, about how to achieve them before starting to dive into code. It was one part that I was missing in my job lately but didn’t realize. By talking to other people out there from a huge variety of professional backgrounds instead of constantly living in the bubble of web developers, I gained a different view of looking at and using websites, of how technology is used and how important (or sometimes unimportant) technology is for people.\nOn a last note, I’m currently available for a small frontend/fullstack project so if you know something or need someone like me, talk to me. Bonus if it’s for a sustainable company, project or has a positive environmental impact.  \nIn full honesty, Gardening is lot of fun, often really hard work, but also not super well paid. And I think I’m not ready to drop web development entirely, it can be so much fun as well!\nNews\n\n\tOh yes, two new Firefox versions are here, v82 and v83 and they bring us DevTool inspection of server-send events, the Media Session API, CSS ::file-selector-button (yay!), conic-gradient, WebRender, Pinch to zoom on desktop, and more.\n\tSafari 14 is here and brings Web Extensions, Webpage Translation, Performance improvements, interoperability and better standards and compatibility by improving Web Platform Test passes. Safari now has a privacy report that shows trackers and third party data issues on a webpage to users quite prominently, it brings WebP support, supports CSS image-orientation, :is(), :where() (resetting specificity for the selector to 0, wohoo). JavaScript gets BigInt support and optional chaining via ?..\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tBetsy Mikel shares how to write microcopy that improves the user experience even with a strategy how to analyze microcopy and how to collect feedback.\n\nTooling\n\n\tUpptime is an open source uptime and status page system, powered entirely by GitHub Actions and Issues. Cool!\n\nSecurity\n\n\tCrowdsec is an open-source, lightweight service (written in Go) to detect and respond to bad behaviours and uses a global community-wide IP reputation database. Heard of fail2ban? This is a more modern approach of the service.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tPostgres doesn’t stop to surprise me (positively). James Coleman shares some tips on how to save space nearly for free by using a custom Ruby gem.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tTomek Sułkowski gave us a nice tip in a tweet: Using autocomplete=\"one-time-code\" in a form field will auto-fill an 2-FA code from messages or other apps in some browsers like Safari. This is such a nice UX and so simple to build in.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere’s Atkinson, a new free and hyperlegible font published by the Braille institute.\n\tNataly Birch on email design accessibility best practices with a good few handful of tips what we can do better in emails and why we and our users benefit from it.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tPhilip Walton shares how to build a back/forward (“bfcache” cache for nearly instant loading of pages when a user uses the browser history buttons. To be honest, I didn’t know this exists until I read the article and it’s super interesting. It’s basically a different cache layer that keeps a live capture of the page including the JavaScript heap in a separate cache. But due to this, it’s not always easy to handle, especially if you have events running on the page so this article contains the answers how to observe the bfcache and add handlers to it. In summary it’s a super powerful feature that’s incredibly useful for web apps but a normal website doesn’t need this layer of complexity.\n\tThis date picker is very nice, flexible, pretty universal and accessible. I know there are many others out there but it’s one that’s working well, working with many coding platforms and is well usable by people.\n\tNice, Apple now lets us integrate Face ID and Touch ID on the web, building it on top of the Web Authentication API. Imagine how this can improve the logging in experience for a good part of your user base.\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can integrate the Web Share API into our websites instead of these ugly lists of social icons. Note that this depends on us how well it’s perceived and working. For example on macOS it’s supported but most apps on the Mac don’t integrate the Framework for it so they don’t show up in the list of sharing services. We should take care that our products support the native frameworks to make the web a better place.\n\tWonder which operator to use in JavaScript for a comparison? Or seen a code snippet and felt weird because you didn’t know what operator this was? Josh W Comeau has built an operator lookup.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares a nice approach of centering a container with sub-elements like a navigation with the fit-content property in CSS. Unfortunately, this still needs vendor prefixes at the moment to work in major browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the CSS Grid minmax() function with some really good examples. Most tutorials explaining this function are very generic and not practical so this was a nice read when I found it. In case you don’t fully understand the minmax syntax yet, give it a read.\n\tIf you use Tailwind CSS or consider to use it, this amazing post on color theming is for you. But also if you don’t use Tailwind there’s at least a good part of the article that we can learn something from in terms of setting colors in CSS.\n\tJosh W. Cameau has a CSS Grid full-bleed layout tutorial that’s pretty complete and includes lots of nice throwbacks into the history of the web.\n\tCSS Text effects are rarely useful but sometimes for big teaser headlines it’s what we need. And if we need them, it’s sometimes not so easy to create a nice and really good effect so this article showing five CSS Text effects is great and includes split colored text, video text, and image background text.\n\tThere are a lot of basic tutorials on CSS Variables but this one contains some pretty handy use cases for variables that go beyond the basic color variable usage but show how we can build a flexible avatar box, defining paddings or gaps by using calc() and variables together.\n\tTalking about colors in CSS, we have Josh Bader sharing how we can use CSS variables calc() and rgb() to enforce high contrast colors in our CSS design system.\n\tRachel Andrew shares how we can build a Masonry layout fully in CSS with CSS Grid Level 3.\n\tDave Rupert explores how we should define semantic variable names in the age of light and dark themes.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEngineering Manager is one of the roles that most people don’t know exactly what it’s about and what these people do. That’s why I found Karl Hughes’ »A day in the life of an Engineering Manager« a really nice one to read. He explains what he does all day and it turns out it’s a role full of soft skills like networking, explaining things or translating between two people, between company departments and to raise awareness around delivery, around process management and recruiting as well as people’s happiness in their jobs. I was Engineering Manager for quite some time as well so I can second what Karl writes here.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou know what scares me most when it comes to climate change and how we as humans perceive it? That we don’t notice that our climate is changing slowly but steadily. Every time a big tornado or wildfires destroy lots of things, our habitats, we read dozens of articles in the news, watch it in TV. But we barely notice that the climate already changed for everyone in the world, that temperatures grew already, that the four seasons changed a little bit, that we face more and more inconsistencies in the weather, more things like wildfires.  I’m not sure if it’s the protection mode in our brains that blocks this away or if it’s just too hard to notice these tiny events when so much other stuff is going on in our lives.\n\tWho is responsible for climate change? The complexity of the problem makes a simple answer elusive. And yet, responsibility matters—not just for assigning blame, but for finding strategic levers for future change. Here’s insight, here’s evidence, here’s a good article to help us understand our biggest problem of humanity yet a bit better. And remember that most plastic is made out of oil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nNow there we go with a new writing. For me, this year has been quite different so far. And no, this is mostly not about some virus spreading across the world but about changing a lot in my work and personal life. My son keeps teaching me new skills, patience, happiness. My gardening project went well the first year and we’re scaling it next year so we can grow vegetables for more than 70 people. Not to stop here, we created a network for workshops and events where local people share their knowledge to improve farming, gardening and live a more resilient and sustainable life as humans.\nOn the other hand, being away from client work for half a year was incredibly useful. I now have a different view on some projects again, I refocused on what’s important in projects and got away from just coding and first ask about the goals, about how to achieve them before starting to dive into code. It was one part that I was missing in my job lately but didn’t realize. By talking to other people out there from a huge variety of professional backgrounds instead of constantly living in the bubble of web developers, I gained a different view of looking at and using websites, of how technology is used and how important (or sometimes unimportant) technology is for people.\nOn a last note, I’m currently available for a small frontend/fullstack project so if you know something or need someone like me, talk to me. Bonus if it’s for a sustainable company, project or has a positive environmental impact.  \nIn full honesty, Gardening is lot of fun, often really hard work, but also not super well paid. And I think I’m not ready to drop web development entirely, it can be so much fun as well!\nNews\n\n\tOh yes, two new Firefox versions are here, v82 and v83 and they bring us DevTool inspection of server-send events, the Media Session API, CSS ::file-selector-button (yay!), conic-gradient, WebRender, Pinch to zoom on desktop, and more.\n\tSafari 14 is here and brings Web Extensions, Webpage Translation, Performance improvements, interoperability and better standards and compatibility by improving Web Platform Test passes. Safari now has a privacy report that shows trackers and third party data issues on a webpage to users quite prominently, it brings WebP support, supports CSS image-orientation, :is(), :where() (resetting specificity for the selector to 0, wohoo). JavaScript gets BigInt support and optional chaining via ?..\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tBetsy Mikel shares how to write microcopy that improves the user experience even with a strategy how to analyze microcopy and how to collect feedback.\n\nTooling\n\n\tUpptime is an open source uptime and status page system, powered entirely by GitHub Actions and Issues. Cool!\n\nSecurity\n\n\tCrowdsec is an open-source, lightweight service (written in Go) to detect and respond to bad behaviours and uses a global community-wide IP reputation database. Heard of fail2ban? This is a more modern approach of the service.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tPostgres doesn’t stop to surprise me (positively). James Coleman shares some tips on how to save space nearly for free by using a custom Ruby gem.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tTomek Sułkowski gave us a nice tip in a tweet: Using autocomplete=\"one-time-code\" in a form field will auto-fill an 2-FA code from messages or other apps in some browsers like Safari. This is such a nice UX and so simple to build in.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere’s Atkinson, a new free and hyperlegible font published by the Braille institute.\n\tNataly Birch on email design accessibility best practices with a good few handful of tips what we can do better in emails and why we and our users benefit from it.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tPhilip Walton shares how to build a back/forward (“bfcache” cache for nearly instant loading of pages when a user uses the browser history buttons. To be honest, I didn’t know this exists until I read the article and it’s super interesting. It’s basically a different cache layer that keeps a live capture of the page including the JavaScript heap in a separate cache. But due to this, it’s not always easy to handle, especially if you have events running on the page so this article contains the answers how to observe the bfcache and add handlers to it. In summary it’s a super powerful feature that’s incredibly useful for web apps but a normal website doesn’t need this layer of complexity.\n\tThis date picker is very nice, flexible, pretty universal and accessible. I know there are many others out there but it’s one that’s working well, working with many coding platforms and is well usable by people.\n\tNice, Apple now lets us integrate Face ID and Touch ID on the web, building it on top of the Web Authentication API. Imagine how this can improve the logging in experience for a good part of your user base.\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can integrate the Web Share API into our websites instead of these ugly lists of social icons. Note that this depends on us how well it’s perceived and working. For example on macOS it’s supported but most apps on the Mac don’t integrate the Framework for it so they don’t show up in the list of sharing services. We should take care that our products support the native frameworks to make the web a better place.\n\tWonder which operator to use in JavaScript for a comparison? Or seen a code snippet and felt weird because you didn’t know what operator this was? Josh W Comeau has built an operator lookup.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares a nice approach of centering a container with sub-elements like a navigation with the fit-content property in CSS. Unfortunately, this still needs vendor prefixes at the moment to work in major browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the CSS Grid minmax() function with some really good examples. Most tutorials explaining this function are very generic and not practical so this was a nice read when I found it. In case you don’t fully understand the minmax syntax yet, give it a read.\n\tIf you use Tailwind CSS or consider to use it, this amazing post on color theming is for you. But also if you don’t use Tailwind there’s at least a good part of the article that we can learn something from in terms of setting colors in CSS.\n\tJosh W. Cameau has a CSS Grid full-bleed layout tutorial that’s pretty complete and includes lots of nice throwbacks into the history of the web.\n\tCSS Text effects are rarely useful but sometimes for big teaser headlines it’s what we need. And if we need them, it’s sometimes not so easy to create a nice and really good effect so this article showing five CSS Text effects is great and includes split colored text, video text, and image background text.\n\tThere are a lot of basic tutorials on CSS Variables but this one contains some pretty handy use cases for variables that go beyond the basic color variable usage but show how we can build a flexible avatar box, defining paddings or gaps by using calc() and variables together.\n\tTalking about colors in CSS, we have Josh Bader sharing how we can use CSS variables calc() and rgb() to enforce high contrast colors in our CSS design system.\n\tRachel Andrew shares how we can build a Masonry layout fully in CSS with CSS Grid Level 3.\n\tDave Rupert explores how we should define semantic variable names in the age of light and dark themes.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEngineering Manager is one of the roles that most people don’t know exactly what it’s about and what these people do. That’s why I found Karl Hughes’ »A day in the life of an Engineering Manager« a really nice one to read. He explains what he does all day and it turns out it’s a role full of soft skills like networking, explaining things or translating between two people, between company departments and to raise awareness around delivery, around process management and recruiting as well as people’s happiness in their jobs. I was Engineering Manager for quite some time as well so I can second what Karl writes here.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou know what scares me most when it comes to climate change and how we as humans perceive it? That we don’t notice that our climate is changing slowly but steadily. Every time a big tornado or wildfires destroy lots of things, our habitats, we read dozens of articles in the news, watch it in TV. But we barely notice that the climate already changed for everyone in the world, that temperatures grew already, that the four seasons changed a little bit, that we face more and more inconsistencies in the weather, more things like wildfires.  I’m not sure if it’s the protection mode in our brains that blocks this away or if it’s just too hard to notice these tiny events when so much other stuff is going on in our lives.\n\tWho is responsible for climate change? The complexity of the problem makes a simple answer elusive. And yet, responsibility matters—not just for assigning blame, but for finding strategic levers for future change. Here’s insight, here’s evidence, here’s a good article to help us understand our biggest problem of humanity yet a bit better. And remember that most plastic is made out of oil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\n\n“You can run-away, run-away, run-away… you gotta face this… time is running fast…” — Snoop Lion in his song ‘Rebel Way’\n\nWe can apply this quote to a lot of matters in our lives right now. Our time to do something for ourselves, for our relatives, our animals, our planet is running fast. And whether it’s about voting, about the actions to fight a pendemic or to fight to get back our human rights and freedom in face of country lock-downs, or in the fight against global warming which is getting harder each year we don’t do enough.\nHave we considered the impact of our current system to develop, deploy, test and run our Internet services on the planet? How much energy is used to create all these Docker images, to run all the VMs and hardware machines that are just there to run Continuous Integration systems and get rebuilt from scratch each time we push a little piece of code? Now considering that no provider is yet powering their server clusters completely CO2 neutral, not event trying to count the energy and sources we need to build all the hardware in there, this suddenly shines in a not so bright light. At the same time we destroy the biggest value we have as humans: Our soil. By using farming techniques, chemicals that destroy the soil long-term and building more and more houses and business units on the soil, we destroy our ability to produce food that keeps us living. And then we face a pandemic and wonder why… it’s time to act. Not just to watch another video stream. To reduce our impact, to reduce our energy consumption, our car drives, our use of chemicals that hurt ourselves. And instead, we should focus on what’s doing good to us… nature, calmness, friendship, love, kindness.\nNews\n\n\tPostgres 13 was released and brings performance benefits, application development conveniences such as native UUIDv4 generation, or datetime() support in the JSON path. Here’s an in-depth review including code how to use the new things in v13.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tSteve Messer explains us why his website is killing the planet — or is it really? We can do something.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tChris Coyier shows us how to offer options for mailto: and tel: links in a custom popup modal.\n\tSystem UIcons is a set of icons under Unlicense so you can use without attribution for free (but it’s even cooler if you add an attribution).\n\nTooling\n\n\tumami is a simple self-hosted open web analytics platform.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tterjanq provides us with a collection of short XSS payloads that can be used in different contexts. Pretty cool to do some security testing on our applications.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\tThe browser Chrome is changing the default Referrer-Policy and is now using strict-origin-when-cross-origin by default. That will be for the benefit of the users’ privacy. Of course, if you want to enable another type of policy, you can still do.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tInfinite scrolling is used a lot across the web, especially for item listings. Now the key for this cool way to ease a flow for the user is to implement this right and without layout shift or other glitches. Addy Osmani shows how to avoid layout shifts in infinite scolling. And don’t forget to update the URL to the next paging so if something goes wrong and the user needs to reload the page, they see the same state again.\n\tAVIF is the new hot image format that we can use on the web. Finally, it’s a standard format that’s going to be implemented by probably all browsers quite quickly. Chrome already has support on Desktop and it’s coming to Android soon, Firefox is currently implementing it and Apple is part of the AV1 working group so they’ll probably add it as well soon. Anyway, you can already use the new image format by using the picture element and content negotiation methods as we do it for WebP or other formats already. But why AVIF? Well, it’s a standard that is accepted by many major software companies and it’s really good in compressing images while still looking good. In many cases it’s much better than WebP, and it’s really good for not only photos but also illustrations.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMicrosoft had it for years already as proprietary solution on their platform, now Mozilla added support for the standard Media Query prefers-contrast in Firefox. This means that some colors are enforced by the browser to ensure better contrast and now we can serve high contrast modes of our websites to more users.\n\tDave Rupert appeals for writing alt attribute values like paragraphs so in case of an image loading failure or a screen reader, the user still gets a really good description of what’s to be seen here. This is good, I do this a lot already but one thing to say is that it’s still an attribute so we can’t really write more than one paragraph there. Alternatively, you can still use figure and figcaption elements for this use case and just leave the img element’s alt attribute empty. Never omit the attribute, please, by the way.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tinclusive-dates is a really well made human-friendly datepicker that’s also fully accessible.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAna Tudor shows the future of CSS masonry solutions with CSS Grid. But as support is very limited and yet to be implemented by many browsers, we need a fallback which Ana shows as well in the tutorial.\n\tWonder how to make a gradient colored text nowadays? Serving it as an image or SVG isn’t necessary, Adam Argyle shows us in a Codepen how it can be solved using background-clip and other CSS properties.\n\tWhile we all use box-shadow a lot, the lesser known drop-shadow property is a really cool one: it creates a shadow around the element’s clippings instead of their box-model. Maybe you remember how to create triangles with just some  borders. Using drop-shadow let’s us define a shadow on such elements.\n\tAdam Argyle and Oriol Brufau share how to make custom bullets in a HTML list using the CSS ::marker pseudo-element selectors. This is good because it’s standardizing things we used to hack since years.\n\tStephanie Eckles with a new great tutorial how to apply a custom look to native HTML input fields with the latest methods.\n\tLinearly scale font-size with CSS clamp() based on the viewport. The solution we looked for since a long time is now available in browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the mindset we should use when coding CSS: Just in case.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tCaring about the climate but don’t find things to help? Climatebase is a platform that offers events and jobs to find in the fight against climate change.\n\tMatthias Ott with some simple, honest words on why the change of climate affects us, directly.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou remember I posted a link to a website that’s entirely powered by Solar? Here’s the follow-up that shares how sustainable the project is. Well, crazy how unsustainable technology most of the time is, right?\n\tNigeria′s Bayo Akomolafe: “We aren′t ′in control′ of climate crisis” This interesting read gives us some insight into other cultures and how we could treat our nature and living environment differently to how we’re used to do right now.\n\tWhy soil matters. A good summary of why we should take more care on the soil we live on, we live from. I myself am going to hold workshops and talks beginning next year here in southern Germany about solutions how to take care of soil, how to restore it, preserve it and bind CO2 in the atmosphere in the soil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\n\n“You can run-away, run-away, run-away… you gotta face this… time is running fast…” — Snoop Lion in his song ‘Rebel Way’\n\nWe can apply this quote to a lot of matters in our lives right now. Our time to do something for ourselves, for our relatives, our animals, our planet is running fast. And whether it’s about voting, about the actions to fight a pendemic or to fight to get back our human rights and freedom in face of country lock-downs, or in the fight against global warming which is getting harder each year we don’t do enough.\nHave we considered the impact of our current system to develop, deploy, test and run our Internet services on the planet? How much energy is used to create all these Docker images, to run all the VMs and hardware machines that are just there to run Continuous Integration systems and get rebuilt from scratch each time we push a little piece of code? Now considering that no provider is yet powering their server clusters completely CO2 neutral, not event trying to count the energy and sources we need to build all the hardware in there, this suddenly shines in a not so bright light. At the same time we destroy the biggest value we have as humans: Our soil. By using farming techniques, chemicals that destroy the soil long-term and building more and more houses and business units on the soil, we destroy our ability to produce food that keeps us living. And then we face a pandemic and wonder why… it’s time to act. Not just to watch another video stream. To reduce our impact, to reduce our energy consumption, our car drives, our use of chemicals that hurt ourselves. And instead, we should focus on what’s doing good to us… nature, calmness, friendship, love, kindness.\nNews\n\n\tPostgres 13 was released and brings performance benefits, application development conveniences such as native UUIDv4 generation, or datetime() support in the JSON path. Here’s an in-depth review including code how to use the new things in v13.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tSteve Messer explains us why his website is killing the planet — or is it really? We can do something.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tChris Coyier shows us how to offer options for mailto: and tel: links in a custom popup modal.\n\tSystem UIcons is a set of icons under Unlicense so you can use without attribution for free (but it’s even cooler if you add an attribution).\n\nTooling\n\n\tumami is a simple self-hosted open web analytics platform.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tterjanq provides us with a collection of short XSS payloads that can be used in different contexts. Pretty cool to do some security testing on our applications.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\tThe browser Chrome is changing the default Referrer-Policy and is now using strict-origin-when-cross-origin by default. That will be for the benefit of the users’ privacy. Of course, if you want to enable another type of policy, you can still do.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tInfinite scrolling is used a lot across the web, especially for item listings. Now the key for this cool way to ease a flow for the user is to implement this right and without layout shift or other glitches. Addy Osmani shows how to avoid layout shifts in infinite scolling. And don’t forget to update the URL to the next paging so if something goes wrong and the user needs to reload the page, they see the same state again.\n\tAVIF is the new hot image format that we can use on the web. Finally, it’s a standard format that’s going to be implemented by probably all browsers quite quickly. Chrome already has support on Desktop and it’s coming to Android soon, Firefox is currently implementing it and Apple is part of the AV1 working group so they’ll probably add it as well soon. Anyway, you can already use the new image format by using the picture element and content negotiation methods as we do it for WebP or other formats already. But why AVIF? Well, it’s a standard that is accepted by many major software companies and it’s really good in compressing images while still looking good. In many cases it’s much better than WebP, and it’s really good for not only photos but also illustrations.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMicrosoft had it for years already as proprietary solution on their platform, now Mozilla added support for the standard Media Query prefers-contrast in Firefox. This means that some colors are enforced by the browser to ensure better contrast and now we can serve high contrast modes of our websites to more users.\n\tDave Rupert appeals for writing alt attribute values like paragraphs so in case of an image loading failure or a screen reader, the user still gets a really good description of what’s to be seen here. This is good, I do this a lot already but one thing to say is that it’s still an attribute so we can’t really write more than one paragraph there. Alternatively, you can still use figure and figcaption elements for this use case and just leave the img element’s alt attribute empty. Never omit the attribute, please, by the way.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tinclusive-dates is a really well made human-friendly datepicker that’s also fully accessible.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAna Tudor shows the future of CSS masonry solutions with CSS Grid. But as support is very limited and yet to be implemented by many browsers, we need a fallback which Ana shows as well in the tutorial.\n\tWonder how to make a gradient colored text nowadays? Serving it as an image or SVG isn’t necessary, Adam Argyle shows us in a Codepen how it can be solved using background-clip and other CSS properties.\n\tWhile we all use box-shadow a lot, the lesser known drop-shadow property is a really cool one: it creates a shadow around the element’s clippings instead of their box-model. Maybe you remember how to create triangles with just some  borders. Using drop-shadow let’s us define a shadow on such elements.\n\tAdam Argyle and Oriol Brufau share how to make custom bullets in a HTML list using the CSS ::marker pseudo-element selectors. This is good because it’s standardizing things we used to hack since years.\n\tStephanie Eckles with a new great tutorial how to apply a custom look to native HTML input fields with the latest methods.\n\tLinearly scale font-size with CSS clamp() based on the viewport. The solution we looked for since a long time is now available in browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the mindset we should use when coding CSS: Just in case.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tCaring about the climate but don’t find things to help? Climatebase is a platform that offers events and jobs to find in the fight against climate change.\n\tMatthias Ott with some simple, honest words on why the change of climate affects us, directly.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou remember I posted a link to a website that’s entirely powered by Solar? Here’s the follow-up that shares how sustainable the project is. Well, crazy how unsustainable technology most of the time is, right?\n\tNigeria′s Bayo Akomolafe: “We aren′t ′in control′ of climate crisis” This interesting read gives us some insight into other cultures and how we could treat our nature and living environment differently to how we’re used to do right now.\n\tWhy soil matters. A good summary of why we should take more care on the soil we live on, we live from. I myself am going to hold workshops and talks beginning next year here in southern Germany about solutions how to take care of soil, how to restore it, preserve it and bind CO2 in the atmosphere in the soil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nWow, time flies and I realise that I not only negelected this newsletter for a long time but since I started the draft for this edition, nearly two months of life happened. I’ll have to see how often I can write this again but the goal is to just publish it when I write the draft and not let it wait in the queue for such a long time. If you want to know what happened recently in my life, at least a part of it can be seen here and there are some notes on my Garden (in German only for now). My own blog has been neglected as well but maybe I’ll find more time over the next weeks to give back some life to it. Now over to this weeks topic:\nIt’s our money that rules the world. We together still own more money than anyone else on the planet. What we spend our money on is going to shape the direction where we as society go. We influence whether there will be a war, how many cars are produced, how many pesticides are sprayed across our planet, how many trees in the rainforests are cut, how many planes are polluting  the air we breathe. Every single cent is spent either to a good cause or a bad cause and if we’d bear that in mind every day, we probably would change our shopping behaviour.\nWe can opt for renewable energy in our homes, at the workplace, we can buy natural, organic, non processed food. We don’t need to buy a new iPhone every year, a new car every two or five years, we don’t need to fly to far away destinations just for vacation. We don’t need to buy cheap meat, plastics, a pair of Jeans manufactured by poor children who breath chemicals and colors every day because of what we buy.\nWe’re a small dot in evolution but we can change where we are on the line. More importantly, we, and only we or maximum our children will decide whether the line continues or whether humans go extinct. Like dinosaurs in the past.\nGeneric\n\n\tThe Climate Strike Github organisation created an open source license we can use which prevents oil and gas companies from co-opting our hard work to extracting more fossil fuels.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAhmad Shadeed on how to align a logo image correctly in layouts.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tiOS 14 will bring App-Bound Domains to WKWebView, a new mechanism that will offer better privacy for users in an app’s web view. Until now, the app could monitor any user activity in a web view; with the new App-Bound domain concept that won’t be the case anymore. That comes with the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) being enabled in WKWebView starting with iOS14 as well.\n\tDid you know that you can capture CSP violation events in the browser with JavaScript? The SecurityPolicyViolationEvent does this and tells you all the details we want to know about such an issue. With that, we can easily build a simple reporting tool for our services.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\t“Being a Facebook-Free Business means your customers can trust that you aren’t collaborators with the Facebook machine. That when you spend your money with a Facebook-Free Business, none of that money will find its way back to Facebook’s coffers.”—DHH in Become A Facebook-Free Business. I personally highly value companies that don’t spend money on Facebook (incl Insta, etc.) advertising.\n\tA good example of why one browser alone isn’t making a good ecosystem for us and only diversity, transparency can create a safer product for us users. Chrome’s marketplace was recently cleaned from browser extensions that were installed on 32million browser instances. The fatal thing here is that they didn’t serve the purpose they advertised but instead captured all the browser history and user activity and sent it to shady databases for spam, advertising and retargeting purposes. Better don’t install any extension even from a “trusted marketplace” like Google’s.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tLearn how to design beautiful and accessible link focus states in this tutorial by Ethan Marcotte.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tAda Rose Cannon shares how we can animate DOM changes in JavaScript.\n\tIf we want to look for a specific index in JavaScript we don’t need to use any complex loop with a stop anymore but instead can use Array.prototype.findIndex() which returns the index of the first match of our testing function.\n\tWenson Hsieh shares how to use the Async Clipboard API and the differences and advantages over the methods we used in the past.\n\tiOS Safari 13.4+ allows us to block back and forward navigation gestures. This is very useful for media galleries and image croppers where users interact with elements on the side of the viewport and most likely don’t want to navigate to another page, as Rik Schennink explains.\n\tFluor.js is a cool small library that lets us animate a lot of details on websites. Quite nice!\n\nCSS\n\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can use the new shiny CSS property aspect-ratio in our layouts and with that finally replace various hacks we used to use for over a decade now.\n\tLea Verou with a guide on CSS Variables that handles the basic concepts and real practical use cases.\n\tBram Van Damme shares how to use CSS Grid layout Level 2 to create a Masonry layout.\n\tSara Soueidan on how she uses global and component style settings with CSS Custom Properties.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tAfter a month of trial, the Buffer team now is moving entirely to a 4-day work week as the results of significantly reduced stress, higher autonomy, and higher work happiness, more motivation, better collaboration while productivity surprisingly didn’t suffer.\n\tWhy it’s important to connect productivity with our purpose to make it essential and meaningful productivity. Because what doesn’t serve the mission is burning ourselves out which happens if we just strive for more productivity when it doesn’t serve our own deepest mission.\n\tFinally, there’s a resource to find ethical job sites for freelancers instead of ending up on sites that try to exploit us.\n\tLucas Miller is neuroscientist and he sees Slack as a particularly “scary offender” in stopping people getting their work done because it encourages them to be constantly distracted. Of course that isn’t only about Slack but about all the messenger style chat systems we use — no matter if made by an independent company, Microsoft, Facebook or any other.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIf we frame our own life a little bit different, in evolutionary context, everything we do, everything we see as given or as inherited by our parents can be seen a bit different. We’re then only a small dot in evolution and yet, we are the only ones who can still decide whether the human species will continue to be part of evolution on our planet or not. Evolution is a quite simple concept.\n\tLet’s try to understand why biodiversity is collapsing worldwide at the moment. It means that less species of animals are around in our ecosystem and climate change is fueling it while our agriculture is actively killing the living ground and plants these species need to live. Weirdly, we fail to understand that we won’t get any food, wood and other things that are vital to our health and ability to live if there is no biodiversity anymore. Technology won’t save us in that case, it can only help understand the issue and maybe help improve the situation but the major impact is how we act, what we buy and how we farm.\n\tWe are facing one of the biggest decisions of humankind — a decision on how to face the climate crisis. This is a huge responsibility and at the same time an opportunity. Our chance to work together to initiate a comprehensive change towards a more just society. Here’s the Grassroots Climate Plan with a solid plan what we need and can do to change the current state of burning down our own habitat.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nWow, time flies and I realise that I not only negelected this newsletter for a long time but since I started the draft for this edition, nearly two months of life happened. I’ll have to see how often I can write this again but the goal is to just publish it when I write the draft and not let it wait in the queue for such a long time. If you want to know what happened recently in my life, at least a part of it can be seen here and there are some notes on my Garden (in German only for now). My own blog has been neglected as well but maybe I’ll find more time over the next weeks to give back some life to it. Now over to this weeks topic:\nIt’s our money that rules the world. We together still own more money than anyone else on the planet. What we spend our money on is going to shape the direction where we as society go. We influence whether there will be a war, how many cars are produced, how many pesticides are sprayed across our planet, how many trees in the rainforests are cut, how many planes are polluting  the air we breathe. Every single cent is spent either to a good cause or a bad cause and if we’d bear that in mind every day, we probably would change our shopping behaviour.\nWe can opt for renewable energy in our homes, at the workplace, we can buy natural, organic, non processed food. We don’t need to buy a new iPhone every year, a new car every two or five years, we don’t need to fly to far away destinations just for vacation. We don’t need to buy cheap meat, plastics, a pair of Jeans manufactured by poor children who breath chemicals and colors every day because of what we buy.\nWe’re a small dot in evolution but we can change where we are on the line. More importantly, we, and only we or maximum our children will decide whether the line continues or whether humans go extinct. Like dinosaurs in the past.\nGeneric\n\n\tThe Climate Strike Github organisation created an open source license we can use which prevents oil and gas companies from co-opting our hard work to extracting more fossil fuels.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAhmad Shadeed on how to align a logo image correctly in layouts.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tiOS 14 will bring App-Bound Domains to WKWebView, a new mechanism that will offer better privacy for users in an app’s web view. Until now, the app could monitor any user activity in a web view; with the new App-Bound domain concept that won’t be the case anymore. That comes with the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) being enabled in WKWebView starting with iOS14 as well.\n\tDid you know that you can capture CSP violation events in the browser with JavaScript? The SecurityPolicyViolationEvent does this and tells you all the details we want to know about such an issue. With that, we can easily build a simple reporting tool for our services.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\t“Being a Facebook-Free Business means your customers can trust that you aren’t collaborators with the Facebook machine. That when you spend your money with a Facebook-Free Business, none of that money will find its way back to Facebook’s coffers.”—DHH in Become A Facebook-Free Business. I personally highly value companies that don’t spend money on Facebook (incl Insta, etc.) advertising.\n\tA good example of why one browser alone isn’t making a good ecosystem for us and only diversity, transparency can create a safer product for us users. Chrome’s marketplace was recently cleaned from browser extensions that were installed on 32million browser instances. The fatal thing here is that they didn’t serve the purpose they advertised but instead captured all the browser history and user activity and sent it to shady databases for spam, advertising and retargeting purposes. Better don’t install any extension even from a “trusted marketplace” like Google’s.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tLearn how to design beautiful and accessible link focus states in this tutorial by Ethan Marcotte.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tAda Rose Cannon shares how we can animate DOM changes in JavaScript.\n\tIf we want to look for a specific index in JavaScript we don’t need to use any complex loop with a stop anymore but instead can use Array.prototype.findIndex() which returns the index of the first match of our testing function.\n\tWenson Hsieh shares how to use the Async Clipboard API and the differences and advantages over the methods we used in the past.\n\tiOS Safari 13.4+ allows us to block back and forward navigation gestures. This is very useful for media galleries and image croppers where users interact with elements on the side of the viewport and most likely don’t want to navigate to another page, as Rik Schennink explains.\n\tFluor.js is a cool small library that lets us animate a lot of details on websites. Quite nice!\n\nCSS\n\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can use the new shiny CSS property aspect-ratio in our layouts and with that finally replace various hacks we used to use for over a decade now.\n\tLea Verou with a guide on CSS Variables that handles the basic concepts and real practical use cases.\n\tBram Van Damme shares how to use CSS Grid layout Level 2 to create a Masonry layout.\n\tSara Soueidan on how she uses global and component style settings with CSS Custom Properties.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tAfter a month of trial, the Buffer team now is moving entirely to a 4-day work week as the results of significantly reduced stress, higher autonomy, and higher work happiness, more motivation, better collaboration while productivity surprisingly didn’t suffer.\n\tWhy it’s important to connect productivity with our purpose to make it essential and meaningful productivity. Because what doesn’t serve the mission is burning ourselves out which happens if we just strive for more productivity when it doesn’t serve our own deepest mission.\n\tFinally, there’s a resource to find ethical job sites for freelancers instead of ending up on sites that try to exploit us.\n\tLucas Miller is neuroscientist and he sees Slack as a particularly “scary offender” in stopping people getting their work done because it encourages them to be constantly distracted. Of course that isn’t only about Slack but about all the messenger style chat systems we use — no matter if made by an independent company, Microsoft, Facebook or any other.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIf we frame our own life a little bit different, in evolutionary context, everything we do, everything we see as given or as inherited by our parents can be seen a bit different. We’re then only a small dot in evolution and yet, we are the only ones who can still decide whether the human species will continue to be part of evolution on our planet or not. Evolution is a quite simple concept.\n\tLet’s try to understand why biodiversity is collapsing worldwide at the moment.

      "title": "WDRL — Edition 282: Welcome back again, the web has changed, work as well.",
      "summary": "Hey,\n\nHello my fellow readers! After months of silence I’m back. Since my last update in February a lot has changed, not only in my life but in everyones’. A virus makes us living differently than we are  used to and work has changed with it. A lot of people work from home these days, others lost their jobs and many are facing a change of rules in any part of life. Kids can’t go to school, vacation is not allowed for a specific time or in other cases is enforced to use during the calm times.\nFor myself, my life changed quite a bit in March and April. I started with a new field to grow vegetables nearby in March and it keeps me busy for most of the week right now. It’s a CSA and we can already give ten families including our own nearly enough vegetables for the week with the amount growing every week. In April, my son was born, right in the middle of a weird time that enabled us to welcome him calm and easy to our world.\nThe Web… where to start? For me, now just watching from outside as I laid down all my jobs during the past months to enjoy family time and do the garden, it felt weird to read about all the technological changes during a virus that changes the lives of many people. On the other hand, life goes on, work goes on, and it’s great to see that some people continue to build amazing things, to make better browsers, to invent technologies and services that help all the other people out there struggling right now.\nOur own species to me remains a mystery: While during the crisis and lockdowns, we achieved to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, this quickly goes back or even worse since we “recover” from the lockdowns. I lost my hope that people will fly less now for private and business purposes and may rethink their lives and get on a more sustainable track. I read a lot about how to prevent getting sick, how to stay sane during this heavy, exhausting times and it’s all about your inner peace, about health and about happiness. Many solutions how to achieve it are going outside right where you are, meditate, get rid of stuff you don’t use or need. Most people in my country know less about cities and villages or areas in their own country than in Italy or France or even more abroad. Why is it still not cool to go on vacation in your own country or neighbour country? It takes you only 1 – 3 hours by train instead of a flight that takes 16 hours just to enjoy another beach that’s no different to what you could visit also with a 2 – 3 hours flight. We all watch nature and outdoor adventure documentaries on Netflix but we don’t do it ourselves. I’ve never been truly happier at work than in the past months being outdoors on my field every day, no matter which weather. My back does not hurt anymore, I’m less stressed out and overall way happier. I don’t earn a lot of money right now and we all know that earning money with growing  vegetables by hand and with love doesn’t pay a lot of bills. But I decided now that it just needs to pay my bills. I’ll continue to be a freelance developer to earn a baseline of money but splitting my work into two jobs was by far the best I could do for myself lately.\nAs always, my thoughts are thought as a trigger to you. Disregard it if you don’t want to think about it or don’t have the time right now. Reply to me if you think you want to say something or have a question. Share it, if you think you know someone who would benefit from it or write your own thoughts to the public if you think they’ll benefit others.\nNews\n\n\tUhm, so there’s Firefox 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77 out since my last update. The most important news are: Better WebRTC privacy protections, faster search bar, locally cached trusted Web PKI Certificate Authority certificates, support for the loading attribute on img elements, Picture-in-picture support, Audio Worklet support, and support for the JavaScript API String.prototype.replaceAll().\n\tWebKit in the meanwhile introduced Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking to improve privacy for users. Quite a big change although we could see it coming.\n\tChrome 80, 81, 83 now supports Module Workers, optional chaining in JavaScript, trusted types, new default form styles, support for the native file system API, and new cross-origin policies.\n\tSafari 13.1 adds support for the Web Animation API, Async Clipboard API, JavaScript replaceAll, nullish coalesing operator, ResizeObserver, the enterkeyhint attribute for form inputs, Picture-in-Picture API, and the RemotePlayback API.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tJosé Manrique López de la Fuente on Ethics and Open Source Software Development. The plea for an ethical license for copyleft comes up again.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAlex Holachek shares her experiences on how to make form inputs better for mobile users by choosing the right input types, attributes, validators.\n\t“It is not uncommon that I raise an accessibility or usability issue with a client’s design or implementation and am met with either ‘But Google does this,’ or ‘But Apple does this.’” Adrian Roselli in a revealing, open statement on why we really shouldn’t care about what the big companies do because they don’t know either.\n\nTooling\n\n\tTobias Tom shares how to use bash operators effectively and shows that there’s more than just the && operator.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tdeSEC is a free and secure DNS hosting running on open source software and sounds pretty cool. It even has an anycast so it’s fast around the world while offering more security than most other services that you pay for.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tTim Kadlec on building web solutions with friction and why he loves the concept of Bundlephobia, a tool that warns you about your JavaScript bundle size.\n\tDanny van Kooten is the author of a very common Wordpress plugin. He made some simple changes and with it saved probably about 59000kg of CO2, all by removing a 20kb JavaScript dependency. There’s little chance you can similarly easy cut your personal emissions so this gives us a clue how important it is to not be careless about what we do on the web.\n\tHow fast is PHP 8 going to be? Although there are only prereleases available yet, it’s probably a lot faster than version 7.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere are the Standards for Writing Code Accessibly.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tArrays, arrays, arrays, one of the most common things we use in programming languages. Here’s Rebecca Uranga explaining the most common modern JavaScript Array methods and when to use which one.\n\tArrow functions are handy but they’re also not very great when we need to debug them. But Dmitri Pavlutin shares how to write better arrow functions.\n\nCSS\n\n\tJhey Tompkins shows us how we can create a responsive CSS Motion Path.\n\tDiagonal layouts are pretty common in the past years, but they often were hacked together quite ugly to achieve the look. However, in 2020 we can do it quite nicely with modern CSS techniques and Nils Binder shares how.\n\tSometimes the specification is the best documentation. Inside the CSS Values and Units Module Level 4 you can learn about the min(), max() but more importantly about the clamp() function in CSS that allows you to e.g. force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px by stating: font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px); All we ever wanted for fonts, right?\n\tOh, what if we could style form inputs nicely and with simple CSS? Aaron Iker shares how we can do it.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThis news made me very unhappy. It’s one of the main reasons I chose to change my profession, to do something actively against climate change, to become a climate farmer: “One in five children have had nightmares about climate change while more than half do not think they are being listened to on the subject, a survey has found”. It’s upon us, parents, uncles/aunts, and friends of parents to fix this problem, so that these kids don’t need to suffer from bad dreams.\n\tLeo Babauta on the heartbreaking effects of being only partly committed to most things.\n\t“When you bought your first smartphone, did you know you would spend more than 1,000 hours a year looking at it? […] If we wasted money the way we waste time, we’d all be bankrupt.” — Seth Godin\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tEricsson gives us a “quick guide” to our digital carbon footprint that shows our impact of using all the online services. And while the subtitle says it’s little, it also reveals that there’s potential to reduce the impact by 80 percent if providers would use greener energy and infrastructure.\n\tSo who would think about farming when we’re talking about air quality and clean air? Well, it seems that California’s regulations help farms produce more food since the trees’ photosynthesis is more efficient when there’s less ground ozone.\n\tHow does climate change impact Europe? Because common news mostly include other areas in the world, we know little about it. But this great interactive maps model shows the change of weather in a simple way. Heavy rains, forest fires, agricultural issues, draughts will all become more serious and more frequent, it seems.\n\tAs a company you can stand up and protect your clients, you can be political. See the example of Basecamp who now deny to offer their products to employee-surveillance products and services.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better. The next edition will hopefully be served to your inboxes way sooner again and I already have a couple of thoughts and links in the queue.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nHello my fellow readers! After months of silence I’m back. Since my last update in February a lot has changed, not only in my life but in everyones’. A virus makes us living differently than we are  used to and work has changed with it. A lot of people work from home these days, others lost their jobs and many are facing a change of rules in any part of life. Kids can’t go to school, vacation is not allowed for a specific time or in other cases is enforced to use during the calm times.\nFor myself, my life changed quite a bit in March and April. I started with a new field to grow vegetables nearby in March and it keeps me busy for most of the week right now. It’s a CSA and we can already give ten families including our own nearly enough vegetables for the week with the amount growing every week. In April, my son was born, right in the middle of a weird time that enabled us to welcome him calm and easy to our world.\nThe Web… where to start? For me, now just watching from outside as I laid down all my jobs during the past months to enjoy family time and do the garden, it felt weird to read about all the technological changes during a virus that changes the lives of many people. On the other hand, life goes on, work goes on, and it’s great to see that some people continue to build amazing things, to make better browsers, to invent technologies and services that help all the other people out there struggling right now.\nOur own species to me remains a mystery: While during the crisis and lockdowns, we achieved to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, this quickly goes back or even worse since we “recover” from the lockdowns. I lost my hope that people will fly less now for private and business purposes and may rethink their lives and get on a more sustainable track. I read a lot about how to prevent getting sick, how to stay sane during this heavy, exhausting times and it’s all about your inner peace, about health and about happiness. Many solutions how to achieve it are going outside right where you are, meditate, get rid of stuff you don’t use or need. Most people in my country know less about cities and villages or areas in their own country than in Italy or France or even more abroad. Why is it still not cool to go on vacation in your own country or neighbour country? It takes you only 1 – 3 hours by train instead of a flight that takes 16 hours just to enjoy another beach that’s no different to what you could visit also with a 2 – 3 hours flight. We all watch nature and outdoor adventure documentaries on Netflix but we don’t do it ourselves. I’ve never been truly happier at work than in the past months being outdoors on my field every day, no matter which weather. My back does not hurt anymore, I’m less stressed out and overall way happier. I don’t earn a lot of money right now and we all know that earning money with growing  vegetables by hand and with love doesn’t pay a lot of bills. But I decided now that it just needs to pay my bills. I’ll continue to be a freelance developer to earn a baseline of money but splitting my work into two jobs was by far the best I could do for myself lately.\nAs always, my thoughts are thought as a trigger to you. Disregard it if you don’t want to think about it or don’t have the time right now. Reply to me if you think you want to say something or have a question. Share it, if you think you know someone who would benefit from it or write your own thoughts to the public if you think they’ll benefit others.\nNews\n\n\tUhm, so there’s Firefox 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77 out since my last update. The most important news are: Better WebRTC privacy protections, faster search bar, locally cached trusted Web PKI Certificate Authority certificates, support for the loading attribute on img elements, Picture-in-picture support, Audio Worklet support, and support for the JavaScript API String.prototype.replaceAll().\n\tWebKit in the meanwhile introduced Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking to improve privacy for users. Quite a big change although we could see it coming.\n\tChrome 80, 81, 83 now supports Module Workers, optional chaining in JavaScript, trusted types, new default form styles, support for the native file system API, and new cross-origin policies.\n\tSafari 13.1 adds support for the Web Animation API, Async Clipboard API, JavaScript replaceAll, nullish coalesing operator, ResizeObserver, the enterkeyhint attribute for form inputs, Picture-in-Picture API, and the RemotePlayback API.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tJosé Manrique López de la Fuente on Ethics and Open Source Software Development. The plea for an ethical license for copyleft comes up again.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAlex Holachek shares her experiences on how to make form inputs better for mobile users by choosing the right input types, attributes, validators.\n\t“It is not uncommon that I raise an accessibility or usability issue with a client’s design or implementation and am met with either ‘But Google does this,’ or ‘But Apple does this.’” Adrian Roselli in a revealing, open statement on why we really shouldn’t care about what the big companies do because they don’t know either.\n\nTooling\n\n\tTobias Tom shares how to use bash operators effectively and shows that there’s more than just the && operator.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tdeSEC is a free and secure DNS hosting running on open source software and sounds pretty cool. It even has an anycast so it’s fast around the world while offering more security than most other services that you pay for.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tTim Kadlec on building web solutions with friction and why he loves the concept of Bundlephobia, a tool that warns you about your JavaScript bundle size.\n\tDanny van Kooten is the author of a very common Wordpress plugin. He made some simple changes and with it saved probably about 59000kg of CO2, all by removing a 20kb JavaScript dependency. There’s little chance you can similarly easy cut your personal emissions so this gives us a clue how important it is to not be careless about what we do on the web.\n\tHow fast is PHP 8 going to be? Although there are only prereleases available yet, it’s probably a lot faster than version 7.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere are the Standards for Writing Code Accessibly.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tArrays, arrays, arrays, one of the most common things we use in programming languages. Here’s Rebecca Uranga explaining the most common modern JavaScript Array methods and when to use which one.\n\tArrow functions are handy but they’re also not very great when we need to debug them. But Dmitri Pavlutin shares how to write better arrow functions.\n\nCSS\n\n\tJhey Tompkins shows us how we can create a responsive CSS Motion Path.\n\tDiagonal layouts are pretty common in the past years, but they often were hacked together quite ugly to achieve the look. However, in 2020 we can do it quite nicely with modern CSS techniques and Nils Binder shares how.\n\tSometimes the specification is the best documentation. Inside the CSS Values and Units Module Level 4 you can learn about the min(), max() but more importantly about the clamp() function in CSS that allows you to e.g. force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px by stating: font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px); All we ever wanted for fonts, right?\n\tOh, what if we could style form inputs nicely and with simple CSS?

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nThere’s so much potential in all of us. There’s so much distraction in our lives today. We tend to continue doing not something different because we have too much on our plates, we are too distracted. We don’t have time to focus on what we really want to do, focus on what we want to change, focus on helping other people or focus on self-care.\nIn 2020 I opened a Community Supported Agriculture to provide local, naturally grown and healthy food to people nearby. No need for them to buy it in the supermarket where it was transported many hundred kilometers through the country and isn’t fresh anymore. My action to foster local community, to do something for the better, for the climate, for other people with a real impact.\nI will also take three months of parental leave time for my family (my wife and soon my newborn child) and for myself, to get focus on the things that are in my mind but never find time to think properly about. This means no work, no WDRL, no other developer related stuff during that time so an entirely different lifestyle for a limited time. Let’s see what this brings.\nNews\n\n\tPHP 7.4 is the latest version but v8 is in the works and Brent shares what’s new in PHP 8: We’ll likely get Union types, a Just in time compiler, a static return type, weak maps, ::class on objects as easier form of writing get_class(), it lets us create DateTime objects from an interface, and some more. What’s changing?  Concatenation precedence, error reporting types, and error silencing via @ suppression.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tHugo Giraudel shares the path of how they transformed a very MVP app into a great, modern web app that’s scalable, fast and accessible: Lessons from building N26 for the web.\n\tThe Architecture of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine, circa 2019. A deep dive into Microservices, Kubernetes and more. Real time indexing with Kafka, Cassandra; Deployments with Ansible, Salt and Terraform. A lot and this is still just a snapshot of a fast changing ecosystem.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tJonathon Colman analyzed mobile app designs and 36% is the right amount of text in mobile apps. An interesting design journey through countless apps that shows the importance of text in design.\n\nTooling\n\n\tNow this site is incredibly useful for configuring PostgreSQL as it’s a complete config guide written for humans.\n\tSpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. What’s that? A tool that integrates with every data source available and analyses them, making that data easy to navigate in a UI.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMarcus Herrmann shows us how to build accessible routing in Vue.js.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tThis is <progressive-image>,  a custom element that progressively enhances image placeholders once they are in the viewport, made by André Ruffert. It lazy loads, has a dave data option, produces no reflow, and has no dependencies.\n\tPhilip Walton shares how we can serve way smaller HTML payloads in applications by using Service Workers for them.\n\nCSS\n\n\tIt’s interesting to see where we started with CSS over twenty years ago and where we are now. I myself built my first website in 2001 with Framesets and inline CSS and HTML 4 style attributes. Quickly after, I learned a bit how to use tables to create layouts (Photoshop could write most of the code, huh!) but gladly this didn’t take long until we had CSS2.1 which allowed us to create way better and more semantic layouts.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEnough is enough. But what’s enough? Having less stuff (aka “minimalism”) can’t be successful for us long-term, it can only serve as a path to sufficiency and satisfaction. The goal needs to be that we solve enough for us, that we realize and incorporate that we don’t need more, that we have enough.\n\tFrank Chimero with a list of things that foster burnout: Our achievement culture, hyperactive comparison, isolation, the lack of work ethics, unnecessary self-improvement thoughts, and a couple more. It’s the first step to identify these points and then take care that not too many in parallel are true for our lives.\n\tA new guide 'With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility' arrives during a period of backlash on campuses, where tech companies like Amazon and Palantir recruit. It’s by Mozilla and it wants young people to consider ‘Ethical Issues’ before taking jobs in tech. It’s on healthy work places, healthy company and startup culture, working on real problems in the world and not causing any harm with our work we do.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tHow your clothes become microfibre pollution in the sea. We buy plastic fibre clothes, wash them and the plastic is slowly dissolving into microplastic in the washing mashine and the sewage treatment plants can’t filter it so it gets into the rivers which end up in the sea.\n\tParis, France, 2020: The mayor announces that they plan to make the city fully cyclist friendly in the next four years. But what does it mean and how will the city change? It’s a great plan that ensures cycling is )the most efficient way to navigate from A to B.\n\tSimon Weckert is an artist and he has a fun project where he hacks Google’s traffic jam algorithm by walking on empty streets with a dozen phones using Google Maps directions. The result? More empty streets because Google reroutes other cars to avoid the jam.\n\tThe open climate science group has analyzed the past 2k years and this shows the development of global temperature in a visual way between year 1 and 2019 AD. It’s super interesting to see that how unusual the current period of the past 150–200 years is in terms of our planet’s climate. See, humans exists since way longer than 1AD so this visualization also shows us where the solution to fix climate change would be. We have to look back and adapt our lifestyle a bit. Local, following the year rythm, slower, and happier.\n\n\nFinally, let me recommend you the printed books of Cabins that are simple and serve the one purpose we all strive for: A space that spellbind us in its warmth and ingenious simplicity.\nIf you want to support produce WDRL, contribute via PayPal or Stripe. Every small amount you pledge will help pay my costs. Thanks a lot!Anselm",

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nThere’s so much potential in all of us. There’s so much distraction in our lives today. We tend to continue doing not something different because we have too much on our plates, we are too distracted. We don’t have time to focus on what we really want to do, focus on what we want to change, focus on helping other people or focus on self-care.\nIn 2020 I opened a Community Supported Agriculture to provide local, naturally grown and healthy food to people nearby. No need for them to buy it in the supermarket where it was transported many hundred kilometers through the country and isn’t fresh anymore. My action to foster local community, to do something for the better, for the climate, for other people with a real impact.\nI will also take three months of parental leave time for my family (my wife and soon my newborn child) and for myself, to get focus on the things that are in my mind but never find time to think properly about. This means no work, no WDRL, no other developer related stuff during that time so an entirely different lifestyle for a limited time. Let’s see what this brings.\nNews\n\n\tPHP 7.4 is the latest version but v8 is in the works and Brent shares what’s new in PHP 8: We’ll likely get Union types, a Just in time compiler, a static return type, weak maps, ::class on objects as easier form of writing get_class(), it lets us create DateTime objects from an interface, and some more. What’s changing?  Concatenation precedence, error reporting types, and error silencing via @ suppression.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tHugo Giraudel shares the path of how they transformed a very MVP app into a great, modern web app that’s scalable, fast and accessible: Lessons from building N26 for the web.\n\tThe Architecture of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine, circa 2019. A deep dive into Microservices, Kubernetes and more. Real time indexing with Kafka, Cassandra; Deployments with Ansible, Salt and Terraform. A lot and this is still just a snapshot of a fast changing ecosystem.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tJonathon Colman analyzed mobile app designs and 36% is the right amount of text in mobile apps. An interesting design journey through countless apps that shows the importance of text in design.\n\nTooling\n\n\tNow this site is incredibly useful for configuring PostgreSQL as it’s a complete config guide written for humans.\n\tSpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. What’s that? A tool that integrates with every data source available and analyses them, making that data easy to navigate in a UI.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMarcus Herrmann shows us how to build accessible routing in Vue.js.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tThis is <progressive-image>,  a custom element that progressively enhances image placeholders once they are in the viewport, made by André Ruffert. It lazy loads, has a dave data option, produces no reflow, and has no dependencies.\n\tPhilip Walton shares how we can serve way smaller HTML payloads in applications by using Service Workers for them.\n\nCSS\n\n\tIt’s interesting to see where we started with CSS over twenty years ago and where we are now. I myself built my first website in 2001 with Framesets and inline CSS and HTML 4 style attributes. Quickly after, I learned a bit how to use tables to create layouts (Photoshop could write most of the code, huh!) but gladly this didn’t take long until we had CSS2.1 which allowed us to create way better and more semantic layouts.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEnough is enough. But what’s enough? Having less stuff (aka “minimalism”) can’t be successful for us long-term, it can only serve as a path to sufficiency and satisfaction. The goal needs to be that we solve enough for us, that we realize and incorporate that we don’t need more, that we have enough.\n\tFrank Chimero with a list of things that foster burnout: Our achievement culture, hyperactive comparison, isolation, the lack of work ethics, unnecessary self-improvement thoughts, and a couple more. It’s the first step to identify these points and then take care that not too many in parallel are true for our lives.\n\tA new guide 'With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility' arrives during a period of backlash on campuses, where tech companies like Amazon and Palantir recruit.

We buy plastic fibre clothes, wash them and the plastic is slowly dissolving into microplastic in the washing mashine and the sewage treatment plants can’t filter it so it gets into the rivers which end up in the sea.\n\tParis, France, 2020: The mayor announces that they plan to make the city fully cyclist friendly in the next four years. But what does it mean and how will the city change?
