One of them exploded. To this day I work with one eye. My dad decided that I would have to stay on the farm. But I insisted.

He would later pass entry exams for the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, graduating in 1959.</p>\n<p>“I went to Warsaw with only a few zlotys with me, which my mother gave me for a roll, but that was not enough for food or for the train. So I admit that I was riding on a fake ticket. In the spot, I ate in a cheap bar in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariensztat\">Mariensztat</a>, where one meal had to be enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I remember it was a rhubarb soup and a thin macaroon. It was the only thing I could do.”</p>\n<p>“The scholarship was absolutely not enough for me. I also used to smoke cigarettes. I had no choice but to earn some extra money somewhere. In the second year, thanks to a friend, we won orders in a scientific and technical publishing house for the design of book covers, and when we were in the third year, it was this publishing house that announced a nationwide competition for a graphic sign. I had no idea about this area of ​​design, so I would go to the library and see what these characters look like, what they are. I tried and sent a few proposals for the competition. It was attended by an older generation of pre-war graphic artists who were still working and doing beautiful things. When I saw their works next to mine at the post-competition exhibition I was extremely ashamed. How could I send such scribbles?! It had nothing to do with a professionally designed sign, it was some kind of smear on a napkin in a coffee shop.”</p>\n<p>You can read more of this time in Karol’s life, and how his energy turned from painting to design, in an insightful interview on <a href=\"https://weekend.gazeta.pl/weekend/7,177333,22815308,karol-sliwka-leonarda-i-michala-aniola-poznalem-dzieki-ksiazkom.html\">weekend.gazeta.pl</a> (in Polish, I used Chrome’s translate).

      "content_text": "\n\nBorn in 1932 in the Silesian Foothills in Harbutowice, southern Poland, Karol Śliwka began his art education in 1946 at the Evening School of Painting, Sculpture and Graphics in Bielsko-Biała.\n“I was 13 years old and I had been disarming mines in the field. One of them exploded. To this day I work with one eye. My dad decided that I would have to stay on the farm. But I insisted. I said I would learn, and it happened.”\n\n\n\nHis education continued at the State Secondary School of Art Techniques, graduating with a diploma in 1953. He would later pass entry exams for the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, graduating in 1959.\n“I went to Warsaw with only a few zlotys with me, which my mother gave me for a roll, but that was not enough for food or for the train. So I admit that I was riding on a fake ticket. In the spot, I ate in a cheap bar in Mariensztat, where one meal had to be enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I remember it was a rhubarb soup and a thin macaroon. It was the only thing I could do.”\n“The scholarship was absolutely not enough for me. I also used to smoke cigarettes. I had no choice but to earn some extra money somewhere. In the second year, thanks to a friend, we won orders in a scientific and technical publishing house for the design of book covers, and when we were in the third year, it was this publishing house that announced a nationwide competition for a graphic sign. I had no idea about this area of ​​design, so I would go to the library and see what these characters look like, what they are. I tried and sent a few proposals for the competition. It was attended by an older generation of pre-war graphic artists who were still working and doing beautiful things. When I saw their works next to mine at the post-competition exhibition I was extremely ashamed. How could I send such scribbles?! It had nothing to do with a professionally designed sign, it was some kind of smear on a napkin in a coffee shop.”\nYou can read more of this time in Karol’s life, and how his energy turned from painting to design, in an insightful interview on weekend.gazeta.pl (in Polish, I used Chrome’s translate). Or if you prefer to listen and watch, there’s an interview on YouTube that’s very well pieced together, first aired (I think) during the 2018 exhibition of his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his fine art graduation (studying graphic design at night as it wasn’t an option in Warsaw at the time) he began working in the field of applied graphics, later joining the Association of Polish Artists and Designers and the Society of Authors ZAiKS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book above (photos via czytamaja.pl) can be picked up here (also reviewed on YouTube by Christophe De Pelsemaker). Patrick Hardziej is the designer behind the book (among many other interesting design ventures), and he took time out to be interviewed by Counter Print’s Jon Dowling. Worth a read.\n\n\n\nKarol received the Award of the Minister of Culture and Art for his graphic art at the first Polish Exhibition of Graphic Marks in 1969.\nOther awards and distinctions included (to name just a few):\nFirst Degree Prize of the Prime Minister, the Golden Olympic Laurel, in the field of art.

      "content_text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 1,000 items in the collection. As well as logos you’ll find historical posters, stamps, book and record covers.\n“There have been few attempts to narrate or document Uruguayan design tradition; because of this, the country appears to lack a design history. A commitment to my profession, my discipline, and my nation led me to want to fill those gaps, so we founded an archive of Uruguayan graphic design on July 10, 2018.” — Amijai Benderski\nI was surprised to see Edward Johnston’s 1918 London Underground logo in the mix. Turns out he was born in Uruguay before his Scottish parents moved back across the ocean to England when he was just three.\nThe Underground roundel is one of Amijai’s favourites. In his words, “What I idolise about the accomplishment of Edward Johnston is that it is an everlasting design that has transformed into a symbol of British culture.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Lamont interviewed Amijai for Design Reviewed and asked if he felt Uruguayan design is under-represented in design history.\n“I don’t feel that Uruguayan design is under-represented, I know it is.

It’s an independent award scheme by designer Kyle Courtright. Kyle and I have yet to meet in person, but we’ve come to know each other online over the years and I have a lot of respect for him as a family man and as a designer. Kyle kindly answered some questions to give us an insight into the awards.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you want to start a logo competition?</strong></p>\n<p>Like many ideas, Logo Wave was born out of necessity.

      "content_text": "\n\nI’ve been judging the Logo Wave awards for a number of years now. It’s an independent award scheme by designer Kyle Courtright. Kyle and I have yet to meet in person, but we’ve come to know each other online over the years and I have a lot of respect for him as a family man and as a designer. Kyle kindly answered some questions to give us an insight into the awards.\nWhat made you want to start a logo competition?\nLike many ideas, Logo Wave was born out of necessity. I wanted to enter my own work into a logo awards competition and felt frustrated with the antiquated and drawn-out submission process. At that point, I knew I wanted to start a design awards to help support my fellow creatives, and I had three criteria out of the gate:\n\nMust be centered around logos\nMust encourage and give value to creatives\nMust fill a gap in the design awards space\n\nAfter feeling like each of those boxes had the potential to be checked (and getting the green light from my wife), I decided to move forward.

The investment\nWe’re one of the most affordable design awards and we’ve intentionally maintained a wallet-friendly, prize-heavy platform.\n4.

Alfred returned to his hometown from Leipzig after the Second World War to find that all his work had been destroyed.\n\n\n\nThe Aspen Festival logo was by Austrian-born artist, sculptor, photographer, architect, and designer Herbert Bayer (1900–1985).\n\n\n\nAnd this for Machinenfabrik Molins was crafted by the renowned FHK Henrion (1914–1990).\n\n\n\nUsed copies are available from AbeBooks. Also, Stephen Coles’ @typographica profile on Twitter is worth a follow.\n\n\n\nRelated, you might like this 1976 book, Signet Signal Symbol, by Walter Diethelm.",

He learned Spanish to be able to translate Lorca from his mother tongue. From 1949–55 he studied at IDGSA Painting Department in Istanbul, graduating from Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu Workshop.</p>\n<p>As a side job between 1955 and 1960 Maden designed logos, billboard displays, theatre decors, and cinema posters. It wasn’t until after 1960 when he focused on the graphic design discipline, concentrating mainly on publication design. He designed around 8,000 book and magazine covers for many publishing houses, as well as periodicals, brochures, packaging, labels, and around 500 logos. He crafted some of the fonts used in his books, and was the designer of many political election posters. In 1964 he established his own private workshop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01.jpg\" alt=\"Sait Maden photo\" width=\"700\" height=\"789\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5916\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01-266x300.jpg 266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/168229518?h=8ed78ebb57&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<em>Trailer for the Sait Maden documentary by <a href=\"https://www.miracguldogan.com\">Miraç Güldoğan</a>.</em></p>\n<p>He was among the founders of the Graphic Artists Association in 1969, spending a period as chairman of the association. In 1979, in an effort to document the history of Turkish graphic design, Sait started the book project “Turkish Graphic Art from the Beginning to the Present.” This would be the first book of its kind for his country. Although he couldn’t complete the book due to a lack of time and support, parts of the project were published in the “Graphic Art” magazine, and a section was published in the journal “Cevre.” Sait’s attention to the lack of design awareness in Turkey and his comments on the absence of a graphic designer in the museum are thought to explain the lack of support for his work.</p>\n\n<img

Sadly out of print, as far as I can tell. In the preface he wrote, “Since my first award-winning icon was drawn in 1955, I have been an observer and practitioner for fifty years. In these fifty years, I have drawn hundreds of symbols.” <a href=\"https://saltonline.org/en/2238/sadik-karamustafa-ile-solun-70lerdeki-gorsel-seruveni-uzerine\">Sadık Karamustafa</a> said the following about Sait, “It would be fair to say that he is the designer who brought the contemporary typographic approach to Turkish graphic design.”</p>\n<p>In 1996, he founded Çekirdek Publishing in order to publish poetry and translation books. He reflected the different moods that literature brought him into his various illustration styles.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-02.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Sait Maden photo\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5918\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5918\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-02.jpg 1500w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-02-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-02-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" />\n\n<p>Various retrospective exhibitions were publicly shown between 2009 and 2019, and the Turkish design great passed away on June 19th, 2013.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-logos-02.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Sait Maden logos\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5917\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5917\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-logos-02.jpg 1200w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-logos-02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-logos-02-700x524.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-logos-02-768x575.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" />\n\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Sait Maden photo\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5919\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5919\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03.jpg 1920w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03-300x120.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03-700x279.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03-768x306.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03-1536x612.jpg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03-1200x478.jpg 1200w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-03-1860x741.jpg 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />\n\n<p>Sait Maden’s page on the <a href=\"https://ankarakitapligi.org/sait-maden/\">Ankara Library</a> website (in Turkish).</p>\n<p>The logos in this post are archived with more details in the <a href=\"http://www.logobook.com/designer/sait-maden/\">Sait Maden section</a> of the excellent <a href=\"http://www.logobook.com\">Logo Book</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have any stories about Sait, or resources for his work, please comment or get in touch.</p>",
      "content_text": "\n\nBorn on May 3rd, 1931, in Çorum, Turkey, Sait Maden started writing poetry at the age of 13 and began learning French and Ottoman at the age of 16. He learned Spanish to be able to translate Lorca from his mother tongue. From 1949–55 he studied at IDGSA Painting Department in Istanbul, graduating from Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu Workshop.\nAs a side job between 1955 and 1960 Maden designed logos, billboard displays, theatre decors, and cinema posters. It wasn’t until after 1960 when he focused on the graphic design discipline, concentrating mainly on publication design. He designed around 8,000 book and magazine covers for many publishing houses, as well as periodicals, brochures, packaging, labels, and around 500 logos. He crafted some of the fonts used in his books, and was the designer of many political election posters. In 1964 he established his own private workshop.\n\n\nTrailer for the Sait Maden documentary by Miraç Güldoğan.\nHe was among the founders of the Graphic Artists Association in 1969, spending a period as chairman of the association. In 1979, in an effort to document the history of Turkish graphic design, Sait started the book project “Turkish Graphic Art from the Beginning to the Present.” This would be the first book of its kind for his country. Although he couldn’t complete the book due to a lack of time and support, parts of the project were published in the “Graphic Art” magazine, and a section was published in the journal “Cevre.” Sait’s attention to the lack of design awareness in Turkey and his comments on the absence of a graphic designer in the museum are thought to explain the lack of support for his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSait collated his logo designs for his book titled “Simgeler” (Icons) published in 1990. Sadly out of print, as far as I can tell. In the preface he wrote, “Since my first award-winning icon was drawn in 1955, I have been an observer and practitioner for fifty years. In these fifty years, I have drawn hundreds of symbols.” Sadık Karamustafa said the following about Sait, “It would be fair to say that he is the designer who brought the contemporary typographic approach to Turkish graphic design.”\nIn 1996, he founded Çekirdek Publishing in order to publish poetry and translation books. He reflected the different moods that literature brought him into his various illustration styles.\n\n\n\nVarious retrospective exhibitions were publicly shown between 2009 and 2019, and the Turkish design great passed away on June 19th, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSait Maden’s page on the Ankara Library website (in Turkish).\nThe logos in this post are archived with more details in the Sait Maden section of the excellent Logo Book.\nIf you have any stories about Sait, or resources for his work, please comment or get in touch.",

As founder and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine, he employed an illustrator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Robinson_Sykes\">Charles Sykes</a>, and a private secretary, <a href=\"https://www.beaulieu.co.uk/news/women-in-motorsport-social-history-eleanor-thornton/\">Eleanor Velasco Thornton</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1909, Lord Montagu commissioned Sykes (who was also a sculptor) to make a mascot for his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Sykes produced a statue of a young woman in fluttering robes, which he named “The Whisper.” The figure is holding a finger to her lips, which some claim is a reference to Lord Montagu’s close relationship with Eleanor. Others suggest, more prosaically, that it relates to the engine’s quietness.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"The Whisper, Rolls-Royce, Charles Sykes\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5893\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5893\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-700x435.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-768x477.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-1200x746.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>Whatever the truth, The Whisper went on to adorn every Montagu Rolls-Royce. Soon, other owners were having their own ornaments made, much to the displeasure of Rolls-Royce general managing director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Johnson\">Claude Johnson</a>. In 1910, Johnson commissioned Sykes to make an official mascot to protect the company’s products from these unsightly additions. Sykes subtly reinterpreted The Whisper, and created what become known as the Spirit of Ecstasy.</p>\n\n<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Charles Sykes Spirit of Ecstasy\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5878\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5878\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01.jpg 2000w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-700x490.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1536x1075.jpg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1200x840.jpg 1200w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1860x1302.jpg 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" />\n\n<p>Challenging the social conventions of the time, her appearance became instantly iconic, leaning into the wind, arms outstretched, her dress billowing as if in flight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04.jpg\" alt=\"Spirit of Ecstasy\" width=\"700\" height=\"992\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5887\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04-212x300.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Charles Sykes made the mascots from February 1911, until his daughter, Jo, took over in 1928. Jo, the only child of Charles and Jessica Sykes, made the mascots from then until 1939, and has written that her mascot production was about seven per week. This suggests that only about forty percent of the Rolls-Royce cars manufactured between 1911 and 1939 were ordered with mascots (an optional extra). We know that the Sykes’ ceased mascot manufacture after 1939 but most pre-WWII Rolls-Royce cars seen today wear mascots. That would mean that perhaps half of the mascots now on these cars are copies, not made by Charles or his daughter.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Spirit of Ecstasy\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5886\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5886\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>The most common question asked by Rolls-Royce owners is whether their mascot is original. The answer depends on what’s defined as “original.” Charles Sykes’ master models are obviously original. From these he made copies, usually four. He then used these as masters to make agar jelly moulds from which in turn he cast wax patterns to be used to make castings. He then polished these castings and sold them to Rolls-Royce to be put on cars. Almost everyone would call these last original, even though they are copies of copies of Sykes’ original sculpture.</p>\n<p>In recent years the emblem was carefully redrawn by Marina Willer’s team at <a href=\"https://www.pentagram.com/work/rolls-royce-3/story\">Pentagram</a> in London.</p>\n\n<img width=\"2236\" height=\"1319\"

      "content_text": "\n\nLord Montagu of Beaulieu was one of Britain’s motoring pioneers. As founder and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine, he employed an illustrator, Charles Sykes, and a private secretary, Eleanor Velasco Thornton.\nIn 1909, Lord Montagu commissioned Sykes (who was also a sculptor) to make a mascot for his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Sykes produced a statue of a young woman in fluttering robes, which he named “The Whisper.” The figure is holding a finger to her lips, which some claim is a reference to Lord Montagu’s close relationship with Eleanor. Others suggest, more prosaically, that it relates to the engine’s quietness.\n\n\n\nWhatever the truth, The Whisper went on to adorn every Montagu Rolls-Royce. Soon, other owners were having their own ornaments made, much to the displeasure of Rolls-Royce general managing director Claude Johnson. In 1910, Johnson commissioned Sykes to make an official mascot to protect the company’s products from these unsightly additions. Sykes subtly reinterpreted The Whisper, and created what become known as the Spirit of Ecstasy.\n\n\n\nChallenging the social conventions of the time, her appearance became instantly iconic, leaning into the wind, arms outstretched, her dress billowing as if in flight.\n\nCharles Sykes made the mascots from February 1911, until his daughter, Jo, took over in 1928. Jo, the only child of Charles and Jessica Sykes, made the mascots from then until 1939, and has written that her mascot production was about seven per week. This suggests that only about forty percent of the Rolls-Royce cars manufactured between 1911 and 1939 were ordered with mascots (an optional extra). We know that the Sykes’ ceased mascot manufacture after 1939 but most pre-WWII Rolls-Royce cars seen today wear mascots. That would mean that perhaps half of the mascots now on these cars are copies, not made by Charles or his daughter.\n\n\n\nThe most common question asked by Rolls-Royce owners is whether their mascot is original. The answer depends on what’s defined as “original.” Charles Sykes’ master models are obviously original. From these he made copies, usually four. He then used these as masters to make agar jelly moulds from which in turn he cast wax patterns to be used to make castings. He then polished these castings and sold them to Rolls-Royce to be put on cars. Almost everyone would call these last original, even though they are copies of copies of Sykes’ original sculpture.\nIn recent years the emblem was carefully redrawn by Marina Willer’s team at Pentagram in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe static interpretation was combined with Pentagram’s “expression generator,” adding some flexibility, freshness, and distinction to the Rolls-Royce identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, each Spirit of Ecstasy ornament is cast in Southampton, England, and can be produced in 24-carat gold, sterling silver, glass, stainless steel, and even illuminated. The Black Badge cars feature a black Spirit of Ecstasy, and for security the figurine retracts when the ignition is turned off.\n\n\n\nIt’s still unclear whether The Whisper or the Spirit of Ecstasy were truly based on Eleanor Thornton.
