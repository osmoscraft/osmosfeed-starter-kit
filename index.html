    <p class="article__summary">A few days ago, my friend Nathan Smith reminded me of my favorite way to write if...or checks when you want to see if a variable is one of a handful of values: using Array.includes() instead.
Let’s dig in!
A traditional if...or check Let’s say you have a variable, wizard. You want to check if it has a value of Merlin or Gandalf.
Traditionally, you might do something like this.</p>

Today, let’s talk about it!
First, a quick aside on 4g versus 3g Alan’s article notes:
 When using lab tools such as Lighthouse, the network is tethered to simulate 3G, but mobile networks worldwide have changed recently. According to a May 2020 report by Opensignal, the worldwide average availability for 4G is 86.</p>

A few years ago, I realized that helping others have that “aha” moment, seeing them build cool stuff, sharing that excitement at landing their first developer job… that’s way more exciting to me than doing client work.
So now, I get to focus all of my energy on doing more of that! 🤗
Plans for 2022 I’ve got a lot of exciting stuff planned for this year.</p>

The String.padStart() method accepts two arguments: the length the string should be, and what characters to add if it’s not that length.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">I focus a lot on JavaScript here, and I often get asked if I have any recommendations on where to learn HTML and CSS basics.
Today, I wanted to share a cool new project from Bree Hall: 30 Day Beginner HTML &amp; CSS Coding Calendar. Bree explains how it works in this video.
  This 30 day calendar will take you on a journey of learning, understanding, and practicing the fundamentals of HTML and CSS through free videos, practice exercises, and games that can be found online.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">I’ve been using the same computer for almost a decade, but recently upgraded my computer.
By default, macOS uses Apple’s TextEdit app for any text file, and it’s pretty bad. Years ago, on my old machine, I setup Sublime to be my default editor for everything, but couldn’t remember how I did.
I eventually stumbled onto a thread on StackExchange with a working solution. I wanted to document it here so I wouldn’t forget again next time.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">Last week, I wrote an article for CSS Tricks on the one thing I wish everyone would do to make the web better in 2022.
 One of the best things you can do for your website in 2022 is add a service worker, if you don’t have one in place already. Service workers give your website super powers. Today, I want to show you some of the amazing things that they can do, and give you a paint-by-numbers boilerplate that you can use to start using them on your site right away.</p>

My JavaScript education business is actually a side-hustle. It’s a pretty successful one, but not enough to be my full-time thing… yet.
I’d like to make 2022 the year that changes, but I need your help.
To make my JS education work fully self-sustaining, I need to reach more people. If you’ve enjoyed learning from me, here are some specific ways you can help…</p>

 If you prefer self-paced learning, my video courses and ebooks are a great choice. You’ll learn the ins-and-outs of a topic in about an hour. For a more deep and immersive experience, a new session of my workshop series starts in January.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">Buckle up. This month turned out to be a big one. Writing it all out feels like an entire year went by, so I’ll start with the bad that happened at the beginning of the month and move towards the good.
Got COVID
When I posted my Vibe Check №12 and End of 2021 posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.
Thankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tell.
I don’t plan on getting COVID again, but if there’s a silver lining, it’s that at least the general fear of getting it has gone away. But that’s a me-centric perspective when 887,780+ people have passed away from this thing.
Rest in peace, Jackson
On January 4th a friend of our family unexpectedly passed away. Jackson taught me a lot over the years and had a helluva life story. During the civil war in his home country of Liberia, he and some other boys were taken out and left in the desert to die. He survived and came to the US as a young boy in a shipping container. He married (later divorced) and had four wonderful kids. Despite the challenges in his life, he always had an impossible sense of hope which could brighten your day.
Through Jackson I saw first hand how difficult the US immigration system is when a single stain on your record makes you a target for deportation. No pathways, delayed work permits, years of unemployment, immigration lawyers fees, health issues, doctors bills; I saw how unfair the system was to him and his family.
But he loved his kids. Every ounce of concern and every penny he made went to providing for his kids. His kids are nearly grown up now, the first is going off to college on scholarship, and I know they’re going to miss him but I know they know how much he loved them. It’s a sad situation to lose a dedicated parent in high school. If you can spare a prayer for Jackson’s kids and our neighbor Cleo (who was like a mother to Jackson), thank you.
2022 Mantras
It’s been a rough start to the year for sure, but we’re getting through it. I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.

2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent) - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.
2022: Be less disgusting - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.

And for grown-ups, I got another one.

2022: Buy your happiness - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.

I hate how consumerist that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!
Episode 500 of ShopTalk
I wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.
And celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.
I built my first Gunpla

On a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.
Making my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.
I have a new ergonomic keyboard to build, a book of Frank Lloyd Wright kirigami papercraft models, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.
Another big refactor on Luro
One of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on Luro. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a tech de jour it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.
tl;dr— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with boring technology, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.
Statistics
Because I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.

💪 Fitness - Closed my rings 5 days this month

Back doing Apple Fitness
Back doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off


📖 Reading

Peril - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books? You base content heirarchy on what’s before and what’s after?
Violence. Speed. Momentum. - The Dr. Disrespect origin story. 100% toxic action figure masculinity and 100% YAYAYAYAYAYA.
ApocalyptiGirl - I enjoyed this simple post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi.
Head Lopper Vol 4 - Possibly my least favorite Head Lopper, but still Head Lopper so it’s weird and good.


📺 TV, Movies, and Anime - Got COVID, so I had time to watch some shows.

Foundation (AppleTV) - A sci-fi story based on the books by Isaac Asimov. The story lines are a bit drummed up but it makes for better TV.
Komi Can’t Communicate (Netflix) - A shonen story about a boy helping a classmate who has a fear of talking. The supporting cast helps carry the show.
New Game (Crunchyroll) - A show about new situation anxiety centered around a recent high school graduate joining a game studio.
Gundam I (Netflix) - 13 TV episodes smashed into one long movie with fight scenes every 12 minutes.


👾 Video games - Playing some

Return of the Obra Dinn - A murder mystery on a pirate ship
Twelve Minutes - A murder mystery in your own apartment


🎙 Podcasts - One big celebration and one podcast series you should check out.

Recorded

500th Episode of ShopTalk - 🎉
An HTML Select element that is… actually styleable - Chris and I look at the new &lt;selectmenu&gt; prototype built by some folks in Open UI.


Listened

Scene on Radio S4: The Land That Never Has Been Yet - I had to pick my jaw up off the floor as I learned, for the first time, about some of the racist and oligarchic systems embedded in the founding of America that still impact our country today.




📝 Blogging - Some observational posts and a “shitty sci-fi” post which I plan on doing more of.

HTML is general, ARIA is specific - Observational tech blogging. Mixed feedback on this, not sure if I explained it the best, so I’ll keep exploring.
The man playing the ukulele at the doctor’s office. - Observational blogging
The Vacation - A short sci-fi story based on my lament that everything costs money these days.
Five Hundred ShopTalks - A celebration of 10 years of podcasting

    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-31T21:31:00.000Z">2022-01-31T21:31:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.
It’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handful of series that capture snapshots of the industry which I find offer up a neat vantage point of “what’s happening now” from tons of different voices. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to gain perspectives outside my own.
I’m lucky enough to have worked on some cool projects (I once made the Microsoft.com homepage in my spare bedroom), but ShopTalk stands out as a distinct career highlight due to its consistency over time. On a hard drive somewhere I have a graveyard of abandoned side projects, apps, podcasts, and games… yet ShopTalk still stands. We log in every week and do it. Hopefully, getting a smidge better every time. Not all projects need to go 10+ years — and that’s something I still need to learn, it’s okay for them to go away, they can and should change — but it’s rewarding when you’re still having fun doing the thing you started doing so long ago. Fine wine, yadda yadda.
Lessons learned
The biggest lesson I’ve learned about podcasting over the last 10 years: it’s all about consistency and quality. Releasing on a consistent day/week/etc (whatever that is for your show) and making sure the show you send to people’s earbuds and cars is a good quality audio file; that means good mic, good edit, decent music and audio cues.
For your podcast or (in more contemporary parlance) your livestream focus on finding one easy thing that can boost your quality. I’m a firm believer in the 80:20 rule, there’s often a trick you can do that makes your thing 80% better with 20% of the effort. Often that’s a microphone or learning proper mic technique. Figure it out for your situation, it’s worth it.
The other thing Chris and I talk about often is that whenever we’ve needed to make a decision we’ve always sided on making our lives easier and we have no regrets. This allows us to continue to enjoy the podcasting with less stress. For example, I use a USB mic with no audio interface, because easier. We don’t do high concept shows that often, because easier. We don’t typically have more than two guests, because easier. We pay an audio editor, because easier. “Easier” has been a good compass for us.
Looking forward
It’s tough to predict the future of ShopTalk, but it’s more of the same I think. We flamed out a bit on getting guests lined up during the pandemic but I think there’s energy to get back on track. We’ve invested in our “studio” a bit and are using Riverside.fm to make having guests and capturing quality audio even easier.
The biggest change going forward is that we’ve branched out into video over on the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel. Be sure to smash that like button and subscribe. We’ve made ~24 episodes since September which isn’t too shabby for a buncha dads.
The final thing is the ShopTalk D-D-D-Discord. We’ve pivoted a smidge from being a broadcast-only podcast to being more of an active community. Lots of friendly folks in there now and because it’s a global chatroom so there’s messages and activity happening from when I wake up to when I go to bed. That’s exciting. There’s a lot more we could be doing (weekly hangouts or whatever) and hope to explore that more going forward.
And lastly,
Thanks to all the people we’ve brought on board to help with the show. First was Aaron Dowd editing, then Chris Enns took over at the audio editor helm, the folks at BuySellAds helping sell ads, Tina Pham at Pham Transcription Services, Miranda Mulligan for helping us with the books, Chris Taylor for the theme songs, the D-D-D-Discord for inspiration, WordPress devs and plugin authors who have helped work on the site, and countless guests who have let us pick their brains over the years. Thanks to everyone who has helped out.
Thank you, dear listener, for downloading ShopTalk in your podcatcher of choice. It means a lot to me that you’d take the time to listen, even once. Thank you. Shopomaniacs 4 lyfe.
And finally, thanks to Chris Coyier, my partner in podcast crimes. It’s been a blast.

    <p class="article__summary">I situated myself in the premium white leather chair, lowered the rollercoaster-like safety harness over my torso, and carefully weighed options on the console in front of me.
&gt; Evening . . . . . . . . 20/person
&gt; Overnight . . . . . . . 100/person
&gt; Weekend . . . . . . . . 250/person
&gt; Week (BEST VALUE!)  . . 5000/family (Limit: 5)

I looked over my right shoulder to see my wife and kids’ anxious faces gleaming back at me, ready with the nervous energy of a thousand suns to embark on our well-earned vacation. It’s been awhile. Some rough, lean years working like hell but through sacrifices and extreme budgeting we had finally saved up enough.
I hesitated to tap the screen. A nervous laugh. A moment of internal calculus. Maybe a handful of evenings would be enough. Would it have the same effect? A couple weekends would surely be enough to reset. More economical. And then we’d have a little left over, just in case.
I sensed my wife’s mind-reading. I sensed her fear I would succumb to my inner self-doubt. She has been working the hardest for this. Sacrificing to create these memories. I needed to shake those miser habits we’ve formed out of years of austerity, what has become my identity.
“Oh, alright. Here we go,” I groaned and grimaced as I tapped the screen.
“You selected One Week” chimed the female voice of the console. Our chairs tilted slightly back, I felt the credits debit from my account, we were off. Finally.
The hiss of the pneumatic syringes, the sting on the spinal column, the cool and heavy breeze of the sedatives, the warm cocktail of endorphins and dopamine to stimulate our deepest dreams and desires, the chairs and harnesses catching our weight as we drifted away from consciousness. The lights in the room slowly dimmed. We would be back in a week.</p>

Twitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.
I mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click &gt; Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.
Ok. Whatever. Then Twitter’s implementation took it a step further and when you add your NFT as a pfp (which you could do before), it added a hexagonal clipping mask to NFT profile pictures. Users that have NFTs get a hexagon, users that don’t get regular old circles. That distinction, that ability to broadcast status, is now coded into the entire application.
It’s weird. NFT pfps already had a strong sense of in-group membership and status performance. You could already spot a crypto enthusiast by their gaudy, semi-generative, ape-themed or pixelated punk profile pic. Thousands of minted NFTs already had a consistent square format (for use as profile pictures) but Twitter added hexagons to the mix for… pizazz? As a watermark to assert ownership?
The crypto community is not short on memes and social signifiers: apes, whales, pixel punks, diamond hands, to the moon, laser eyes, “gm”, WAGMI, probably nothing, .eth usernames, and a slew of in-group words no one else uses like “airdrop”, “fiat”, “petrodollar”, etc. Plenty of indicators, why add another?
I shouldn’t get worked up about a shape, but what I specifically don’t like about the hexagons are that they create another form of “otherism”; haves and have-nots. HODLers and NGMIs. Two camps. In-group and out-group. It’s creating division in a place where the world didn’t need any help creating division. The world doesn’t need more us versus them, yet we willingly apply feature glitter to increse the divide.
Somewhat apropos to this whole situation we’ve found ourselves in, the hexagon is just a thin veneer of symbolism; a mask applied to the mundane giving it the appearance of something special. An illusion of value.

    <p class="article__summary">I was leaving a doctor’s appointment and as I rounded the corner to the waiting room I could hear the dulcet tones of a ukulele, but it sounded close.
My first reaction was “What in the fuck is going on?” as I scanned the ceiling for the speaker where the Muzak was coming from. Then in the waiting room I saw an older white man with a ponytail and a Hawaiian shirt calmly strumming his ukulele.
Again, I reacted, “What the fuck is going on?”
Then I caught myself. This… is… weird.
Why was he playing it in the doctors office? Was he a minstrel? Was he calming the souls of fellow patients?  A minister? A minister to himself? Does he just love Hawaii and goddamn it ain’t no one gonna stop him not even the cops at the doctors office?
I think this moment struck me like a ton of bricks because it’s been awhile since I’ve encountered weird due to the pandemic. Angry? Oh, I’ve encountered plenty of angry. Hot-headed assholes losing their shit in a Chic-fil-A drive thru, yeah I’ve seen that, but been awhile since I’ve seen weird.
The world could use a little more weird.
I miss weird. I miss old Austin.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed &lt;popupdialog&gt; element should have, if any…
The proposed &lt;popupdialog&gt; element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a &lt;div&gt; or a &lt;span&gt; but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?
All good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.
What struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.
HTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. &lt;div&gt;? Sure, that can be a div. &lt;article&gt;? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. &lt;video&gt;? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a &lt;button&gt; and a &lt;button&gt; for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.
There’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">How do you quantify a whole year? I’ve attempted it before and this one is different because I didn’t set out to achieve anything. The mantra for the year was “No goals, only vibes” and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.
Some highlights include:

🙁 Started the year in Stage 5 Covid
😃 Paid off our car!
🙁🙁🙁 Witnessed an insurrection
😢 Lost my grandma Joyce
😃 Started a ShopTalk Discord
😃😃😃 Got a new backyard office shed
🥶🥶🥶 Lost power for 75 hours during the Texas Freeze
😃 Spoke on Accessibility Backlogs at axe-con
😢 Lost my aunt Renee
😃 Got vaccinated
😃 Spoke on Web Components at An Event Apart
🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my camper fixed
😃 Turned 41
😐 Went river camping, but camper broke
😃 Beach camped on a Texas beach
😃😃😃 Rupert family reunion with white water rafting and hiking in Colorado
🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my car fixed (the one I paid off)
😃 Worked with Open UI on Spicy Sections (aka, tabs)
😃😃 Started playing pickle ball
😃 Kids went back to school
😃😃😃 Building a product called Luro with my compadres at Paravel
😃😃😃 Started making ShopTalk YouTubes with Chris
😃 More camping with friends
😃 Blogtober’d
😢 Lost great grandma Jeanne
🙁🙁🙁 Got skin cancer
🙁🙁🙁 Got Mohs surgery
😐 Healed
😢 Lost great grandpa Ed
😵‍💫😵‍💫 Drove across America (twice)
😃😃😃 Saw my family for the holidays
😐 Ending the year in Stage 4 Covid

… and those are more or less the emotional beats in my story of last year. It’s been a year. Ups and downs. A big change for me and for this blog was that I documented it all in my monthly Vibe Checks. That was successful and enjoyable so I plan on continuing those. They’re great to look back on and for rounding up miscellaneous thoughts.
Getting diagnosed with skin cancer and having it removed with Mohs surgery was a big emotional part of the year. I describe it as “ambient stress”, a whiny noise in the background that you try not to pay attention but is affecting your mood. I’m a post-processor so I’m sure it’ll be a bit before that all sinks in. But the general health of my personhood is at the forefront of my mind.
Books and social media
I picked up 40 books this year, down from ~80 last year. A lot of the books and facts in similar genres started repeating themselves. I may have exhausted some of the self-help and popular science genres, it’s all rehashed Malcom Gladwell at some point. Losing steam, I paused on audiobooks and plowed thru podcast arcs instead. Those are fun and immersive. I think next year I’m going to try more paper books and sci-fi.
Media-wise, I broke up with Twitter and deleted it from my phone and iPad. Had a fling with TikTok but that too felt like wasting time. Now my phone is boring. I spent a good amount of time clearing out RSS and podcatcher feeds were my mainstays towards the end of the year.
Work and health
I worked on some cool projects this year like a Covid response dashboard for the CDC of Africa, I got to collab with the fine folks at Happy Cog which felt like a childhood dream come true, and I even made progress on building a product with Paravel — but I’m exhausted. Professionally fulfilled, but exhausted. Can’t remember a single “slow” week. This sounds dour, but it’s sort of how it works out running and starting your own company. I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.
I’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority. And to make a priority I think that needs to a part of my main priority (work) in some way. The plan is to trick my brain into thinking that fitness is part of my job.
Some goals
Plucking some goals for next year…

Make my personal health part of my job
Read 40 books, at least 10 paper books and 10 sci-fi books
Figure out what truly relaxes me

Yeah. I’m doing goals again. Feel free to ask me about ‘em.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">Phew. December. The most hectic month. End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.
But we made it.
The minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained. This happens every year, to the extent that my wife’s family used to think I was faking a sickness to avoid them, but no, I actually like them, it’s my body giving up when work stops.
It’s weird.
Christmas this year was an interstate affair. After realizing flights cost $3200, we resolved to drive to Nebraska to celebrate with my family this year. It’s about ~1000 miles each way. The payoff is seeing my enormous divorced family, brother and step-brothers and their wives, aunts, uncles, cousins, their kids, and 11 of my 23 nieces and nephews. There’s something special about kids playing with their cousins, calling the same people grandma and grandpa has magical properties. Endless screaming, yelling, video games, and snowy mountains of Ready Whip sprayed atop mini-waffles.
Good times.
Hauling Christmas across America isn’t my favorite thing, by air or by land. But driving across America is a neat rite of passage and it’s also the thing that will make me run for public office so we can get some bullet trains in this god forsaken country. Seeing family and celebrating the great magical fat norseman are special times, but I don’t feel super “restored” coming back from vacation.
Lord, I’m tired. I’m weak. I’m worn.


🚙 Drove: 1,890+ miles
📖 Reading

Disciplined Entrepreneurship - A quick and easy startup bootcamp with a 24 step process. A good listen, but probably need the actual book for visualizations to hit hard.
Saving Capitalism - Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and I get upset about the same issues. This book outlines some of the structural problems in regards to wealth generation in our capitalistic democracy.
Project Hail Mary - Science’ing shit in space. Another wonderful page-turner book by Andy Weir.


📝 Blogging - I wrote a lot but published little.

Sustaining Maintaining - a thinkpiece about how there’s little education in open source beyond setting up repos and installing CI/CD; without education everyone learns the hard way, leading to burnout.
Five good feelings - a short dissertation about books


🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes

Shop Talk is inching closer to Episode 500
I took part in the Frontend Horse Holiday Snowtacular where we raised money for TeamSeas to remove over 5 tons of trash from the ocean. I talked about blogs. Brief but fun.
YouTubes - After a month break due to surgery and general busy-ness, ShopTalk managed to cut two episodes.

Astro - 20 minutes of playing with Astro, I used a VTuber skin because my nose was still fucked up.
Play video onscroll - Intersection Observers and the HTML Media Element API, sorta my wheelhouse.


Listened

Rabbit Hole - a NYT investigation into algorithmic radicalization (YouTube, Facebook, etc). A must listen, IMO.

    <p class="article__summary">You see it all the time; a repo with a thousand issues, a hundred open PRs, a thousand forks. v2.0 is on the way but there’s no clear roadmap or communication. Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.
My open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.
The critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.
For every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.
It would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.
But financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source &amp; Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”

From the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.
Towards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:

With the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.

“Burnout”. There’s the word.
I sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.
If I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:

Differentiating between support requests and Issues
Issue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)
How to handle volume without losing your soul
Landing pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)
Setting up testing and continuous integration
How to get Sponsors
How and why to use Discussions
How and why to use Projects and Milestones
How to write good documentation
Setting boundaries and office hours
Effective and clear communication
Choosing an open source business model

Or what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.
I think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.
There’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.
These are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t? My weary soul wants to know.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.
Earlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outage. The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an undefined function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.
Speaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret. It’s called Luro and we think you’ll love it. Before we open the doors, we need to let it bake a bit more with our first cohort of beta testing customers. Then we’ll have more to talk about and show.
Other vibes
I spent a lot of mental energy learning and establishing my thoughts about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs this month. Some of that thinking leaked out on Shop Talk Show #490. I think I’m out for now. There’s a lot to say. Solving ledger-like problems seems okay. DAOs are (probably unenforcable, but) interesting. But truly, nothing compelling other than FOMO right now. Money charts going up is cool and produces a great amount of envy, but I read a lot, listened to a lot of podcasts, challenged myself to be open-minded and not old man yells at cloud, yet … I can’t. And that’s where I’m at on that, for now at least.
All the Web3 hype (as well as Politics Twitter) actually made me uninstall Twitter from my iPad and iPhone… and I kind of love it. I’m unplugged from the outrage machine and it’s much quieter. Stomping the urge to reinstall the app or log in from Mobile Safari for some dumb tweet is the hardest part, but I’m so far successful.
With time to kill, I spent a lot of time watching TikToks and roleplaying videos, both popular DnD5E series (like Critical Role (Campaign 3), Battle for Beyond, The Adventure Zone: Imbalance) and for one-shots systems like Lasers and Feelings. I’m enchanted by the idea of running a one-shot and may try to put one together in one of my Discords. But for now I’ll live vicariously through watching videos and pretend I’m pretending… wait.
I’m even starting to think about making a video game again…
Stats

📖 Reading: Opted for podcasts over audiobooks this month, but still managed to squeeze in three books.

The Bomber Mafia - Continuing my quest to read all the Malcom Gladwell novels. This book was a bit dull, but the theme around “Is there an ethical way to bomb during war?” and the exploration of that theme was interesting enough to sustain me.
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team - A business classic! An interesting look at how different personalities and attitudes can impact a team.
Effortless - Another good, thought-provoking book by Greg McKeown. “How do you not feel overwhelmed even when you become an essentialist?” McKeown shares some strategies for creating “effortless” work. Not 100% practical, but challenging at least.


📝 Blogging: Did not ride the blogging train into November as I hoped, but it’s fine, I watched TikToks instead.

Status Performance Analysis in Team Fortress 2


💪 Fitness: Mild setback as I may have injured a butt cheek swinging a pickaxe while clearing the nandina out of the side yard with my neighbor.
🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes: Released a normal amount of podcasts. Shop Talk is careening towards Episode 500 (which we’ll hit next year).

Released 4 Shop Talk Videos:

Playing with the MD Nichrome Microsite
Random Grids
Knobs
VideoPress


Listens: Cleared out some podcast series I had lingering in the old queue.

The Adventure Zone: Ethersea - I love this universe.
Clearleft Podcast (Season 2 + 3) - An remarkable industry podcast. Incredible editing and incredible guests. It covers a lot of burgeoning design/UX concerns and constantly asks “How can we do X better?”
Wolverine: The Lost Trail (Season 2) - Logan runs from Weapon X, blah blah, not as good as the first season, but entertaining and I love the old-timey serial radio show vibe.

In 2013 Chong-U Lim wrote a research paper for MIT wordily titled Modeling Player Performance in Avatar Customization Using Social Network Data: A Case Study Using Virtual Items in Team Fortress 2. It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI &amp; Games YouTube channel breaks it down.
One interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s social status (social interactions) based on their status performance (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting. Louis Vuitton, but Loot Boxes.

    <p class="article__summary">It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

Twitter has been fever-pitched about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs. It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.
I spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.
NFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.
Two weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">Gamers aren’t known for being the most intelligent people around…
Oh no Tim... 🌎@timthetatman pic.twitter.com/njLv2c59Jy— Wipz (@Wipz) July 29, 2020 
While IQ may be at an all time low, I think there’s actually a wealth of emotional intelligence (EQ) within competitive gaming. It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:

nerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality
buff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality
salty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.
toxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.
tilted - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.
meta - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.
meta shift - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.
mental - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.
chalked - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.
blender - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”
game sense - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions
psychic damage - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&amp;D)

Through gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be tilted. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.
Taking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, salty, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a blender helps let the psychic damage roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.
The concept of meta shifts is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.
Cooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage. There’s not one uniform metric for success, if you measure solely on damage dealt that skews the reality of how success happens.
Bringing this full circle, even your worst performing player — who it would be easy to throw under the bus — might be adding immeasurable value…

    <p class="article__summary">Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.
I needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.
I hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.
Goodbye Grandma Jeanne
My wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.
She was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.
I never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.
The case of the ill-fitting jacket
While trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.
That… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.
Thus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.
Autumnal Camping
In the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.
We are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.
Starting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂
Business-wise
Business-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.
Stats-based Vibe Gamification

📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.

I Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.
The Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.
Artemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.
Monumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction. This is a story I hadn’t heard and needs to be retold more often. The problems then mirror our problems today. If it were not for Dunn’s untimely death, America might be a different place.

    <p class="article__summary">My kids hold beef. And they hold it forever. If one kid in the neighborhood did something they’ll talk about it every other day like it happened yesterday. The friend’s neighbor who is slightly younger but was annoying once? Annoying forever! Even if you’ve played with him since! That new friend who said she saw a dinosaur in her backyard? A liar. Forever.
I don’t get it. I try to counsel them out of their beef. Maybe that girl who saw the dinosaur was just pretending, she has a big imagination (and that’s good!), or maybe someone in a dinosaur suit really ran thru the yard. I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don’t know. And it doesn’t matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.
Oh, but they’ll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying “But remember that time…”
I don’t get it. I don’t see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn’t a beef holder either. She’s one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.</p>

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-02-03T00:00:00.000Z">2022-02-03T00:00:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">
Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.

Chrome 99 beta was released on February 3, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in early March, 2022.
# Remove Battery Status API on insecure origins
Battery Status API is no longer supported on insecure origins,
such as HTTP pages or HTTPS iframes embedded in HTTP pages. The Battery Status
API allows web developers to access, among other things, a system&#039;s battery
charging level and whether it is being charged. It is a powerful feature that
has been around for over a decade and, as such, was originally designed with
different security constraints.
# Remove font-family -webkit-standard
This version of Chrome
removes support for the font-family value &quot;-webkit-standard&quot;.
This value is merely an alias for the proprietary keyword &quot;-webkit-body&quot; and
is only exposed because it&#039;s inherited from WebKit. Removing this improves
alignment with the CSS specifications and with Firefox.
# Remove GamepadList
The
[navigator.getGamepads()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getGamepads)
method now returns an array of
Gamepad objects
instead of a GamepadList.
GamepadList is no longer supported in Chrome. This brings Chrome in line with
specification and with Gecko and Webkit. For information on Gamepads generally, see Play
the Chrome dino game with your gamepad.
# Remove the document.domain setter
The document.domain setter, which allows developers to relax the same-origin
policy has been removed.
This setter complicates the fundamental security boundary Chrome aims to
maintain, and puts roadblocks in the way of post-Spectre changes to Chromium&#039;s
process model.
Chromium&#039;s threat model
requires us to consider a process as the only defensible security boundary. To
do that, it&#039;s necessary to align origins with processes. The document.domain
setter makes this a difficult task, as we don&#039;t know whether the same-origin
policy will be relaxed until runtime, when it&#039;s too late to change the process
into which a document has committed. We have some opt-out mechanisms; ideally
this would switch to an opt-in.
# Update WebCodecs to match the specification
Chrome has removed two
items because of
recent changes in the WebCodecs specification.
The EncodedVideoChunkOutputCallback() method takes an
EncodedVideoChunkMetadata dictionary. Previously a member called
temporalLayerId was located at EncodedVideoChunkMetadata.temporalLayerId. In
line with the specification, it is now located at
EncodedVideoChunkMetadata.SvcOutputMetadata.temporalLayerId.
The specification requires that the VideoFrame() constructor include a timestamp
argument (VideoFrameInit.timestamp) for CanvasImageSource types that don&#039;t
implicitly have a timestamp (for example, HTMLCanvasElement). Failing to include the
timestamp should result in a TypeError, but Chrome previously defaulted the
timestamp to zero. This seems helpful, but is problematic if you then send the
VideoFrame to a VideoEncoder, where timestamps are used to guide bitrate
control.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:

They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.

Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#039;s,
essentially:

Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.

You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

    <p class="article__summary"># The permissions UX until now
When a user visits a site that requests a permission, a bubble pops up to prompt the user to make a
decision. For example, below you can see the geolocation permission prompt as implemented in Chrome
up to version 96. (You can try this and other permissions on our demo site
permission.site.)

# Most permission prompts are ignored or dismissed
Chrome&#039;s telemetry data proves that a lot of permission prompts are ignored. You can explore the
notification permission data
in the Chrome UX report yourself. For now, consider the table below that shows
how Windows users reacted to the geolocation and the notification prompts on sites in an accumulated way:




Action
Percent of geolocation prompts
Percent of notification prompts

Given an ignore/dismiss rate of approximately 85%, and especially given how much the prompt stands out and
insists on users making a decision immediately, there is a conflict between the level of urgency
assumed by the browser versus the user&#039;s preference for waiting to make a decision. This creates the
perception that it&#039;s &quot;annoying&quot; for a site to ask for a permission.
# New design
From Chrome 97 on, we therefore introduced an animated chip UI which appears next to the lock
whenever a permission is requested. This consists of an icon and label describing the permission being
requested. Our aim was to improve the experience of web browsing while avoiding permission requests
that are generally unnecessary for the vast majority of users and frequently ignored or dismissed.

The existing prompt bubble will be shown when the request chip is clicked (if not already shown) and
the request UI is automatically augmented with the request bubble based on the heuristics listed
below:

The permission was triggered through a user gesture when interacting with the site itself rather
than automatically triggered by the site.
The permission is deemed essential and generally non-spammy. Currently this includes camera,
microphone, and camera paired with microphone.

# Flow of the new design
# Without user gesture
For non-essential permissions not triggered by a gesture, the prompt no longer intrudes on the site
contents, and does not insist on an immediate decision. The user can ignore the request chip until
they have enough information to make a decision.

# Without interaction
With no interaction, and after a short delay, the request chip will automatically collapse to just a
blocked icon (to indicate the permission being temporarily blocked), before being dismissed
entirely. The aim is to get out of the way of users who choose not to make a decision letting them do so
without any interaction.

# Expected short-term impact
In the short term, and until users get used to the new UI, it is likely that site owners will observe
lower grant rates for sites, especially for those that auto-request permissions without priming or
demanding a user gesture (which is considered a bad practice anyway). This
acknowledged downside is vastly outweighed by the less interruptive experience.
# Best practices
It is up to the site to ensure it provides the necessary context and only requests permissions at
the appropriate and expected moment. Permissions that have been temporarily blocked—through a user
ignoring the request or dismissing the prompt—can request the permission again within the same
session. Only do this if the permission is essential for the site or feature to work, otherwise it
runs the risk of annoying users and getting auto blocked. In those cases we show the
quiet messaging that
was introduced in Chrome 80. For more general guidance, see
Permission UX.
# Outlook and conclusions
At the moment, the chip appears side-by-side with the padlock, but the intention is to override
the padlock in the future and add closer association between permissions and the site information
surface. There are also plans to show a confirmation with additional feedback on the user&#039;s decision.
The Chrome team is also investigating potentially more aggressive auto-blocking of permissions
based on prior behavior. You will learn about the news here once these plans mature.
Concluding, the new UI reduces the perceived insistence on a decision and improves the browsing
experience. Since most permission prompts are blocked or ignored, the met objective was to improve the
general experience of browsing, while not breaking user flows when showing a permission prompt,
especially in situations where permissions are required to complete a use case.

    <p class="article__summary">Episode 28: by Mark Cogan in Paris, France (January, 2022)
Previous episodes
In 2022, Chrome on iOS will celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Chrome is one of the most widely used iOS apps—it&#039;s currently the number 2 Utility app in the US App Store.
Chrome on iOS provides all of the great Chrome features our users love, including Sync, Translate, Incognito, Password Manager, Autofill, and many more.
Chrome on iOS also integrates with native iOS features such as multi-window and device-wide password autofill.
However, there&#039;s one major thing that makes Chrome on iOS very different from all other Chrome platform implementations.
Chrome on iOS doesn&#039;t use Blink.
Because of Apple&#039;s App Store rules, Chrome on iOS has to use the iOS platform APIs for fetching and rendering web content. So Chrome on iOS uses WebKit, Nitro and CFNetwork where other Chrome platforms are using Blink, V8 and //net. Due to this, and the limited API available for iOS apps to interact with web page content, many Chrome features that use the //content APIs are implemented in Chrome on iOS using JavaScript injection.
Cross-platform features in //components are structured to share as much code as possible across all platforms while keeping //content dependencies siloed:
ls components/some_componentcontent/        # code with dependencies on //content.core/           # cross-platform code with no //content dependencies.ios/            # iOS implementation using JavaScript injection.
Other important differences between Chrome on iOS and other platforms include:

iOS apps are required to be single-process, so Chrome on iOS can&#039;t fork().
Chrome on iOS is written in Objective-C++ (a mix of C++ and Objective-C), along with some Swift.
While you can compile and run Chrome on iOS directly on an iOS device, you can also do a lot of feature development in the quite capable device simulator that Apple provides.

# Get started with Chrome on iOS
You will need:

A macOS computer, 64-bit, running macOS 11.3 or higher. Apple Silicon is supported.
Xcode, the IDE for Apple platforms, version 13.0 or higher.
The current version of the JDK.

See the build instructions for more information.
Fetching the source is much like other platforms:
mkdir ${HOME}/chromium-ioscd ${HOME}/chromium-iosfetch ios
After that, you can build from the command line (or from Xcode):
autoninja -C out/Debug-iphonesimulator chrome
# Learn more about Chrome on iOS feature development
We encourage you to refer to the Chromium style guide. Read Apple&#039;s developer documentation to learn more about Swift, xCode, and other iOS-specific resources.
If you&#039;re typically an iOS developer and new to Chromium, refer to the documentation on important abstractions and data structures.</p>

Here&#039;s what you need to know:

If you’ve tried the Auto Dark Theme origin trial, there’s a new way to
opt out at a per element level.
There’s now support for COLRv1, an evolution of the COLRv0 font
format.
And there&#039;s plenty more.

I&#039;m Pete LePage. Let&#039;s dive in and
see what&#039;s new for developers in Chrome 98.
# Opting out of auto-dark themes on Android
In Chrome 96, we started an origin trial for
Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, if your site is light themed and the user’s OS is in dark
mode, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to your site.
If you&#039;ve signed up for the origin trial, and you want to opt out of the
automatically generated dark theme for a specific page, you can use a meta tag.
&lt;meta name=&quot;color-scheme&quot; content=&quot;only light&quot;&gt;
Or you can opt-out by setting color-scheme: only light on the :root
element.
:root {  color-scheme: only light;}
But the main advantage of this method, is that you can opt out on a
per-element basis by applying a specific style to that element.
.only-light,#my-element {  color-scheme: only light;}
Check out the How to opt-out of Auto Dark Theme section
in Auto Dark Themes on Android for complete details.
# COLRv1 font support
In Chrome 98, there’s now support for COLRv1, an evolution of
the COLRv0 font format. It adds gradients, compositing and blending, and
improved shape reuse for crisp and compact font files that compress well.
A color font makes visual highlights, headlines, and banners really pop out.

One of my favorite use cases for COLRv1 means consistent emojis across all
platforms. You don&#039;t need to replace emojis with image files, because font
files become smaller, and easier to include on your page.

We’re working on ways to improve feature detection, since it’s not as easy as
it should be yet. But this is something to keep an eye on.
Check out COLRv1 Color Gradient Vector Fonts in Chrome 98 for
more details and how you can create your own fonts.
# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string
In just a few months, we&#039;ll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number.
Any code that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be
checked to make sure it handles three digits.
There&#039;s a flag called #force-major-version-to-100 that
will change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure
everything works as expected.

# And more!
Of course there&#039;s plenty more.
CORS preflight requests are now sent ahead of private
network requests for subresources, asking for explicit permission from the
target server.
There’s a new origin trial for Region Capture, an API for
cropping a self-capture video track. Ideal for screen sharing in video
conferencing apps so you don’t create a hall of mirror effect!
Window overlay controls had been planned for Chrome 98, but due to issues found
at the last minute, did not make it in. We are still working on it, and
expect to see it land in the next few releases.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z">2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Cascade layers (the @layer CSS rule) are coming to Chromium 99, Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4 Beta. They enable more explicit control of your CSS files to prevent style-specificity conflicts. This is particularly useful for large codebases, design systems, and when managing third party styles in applications.
Layering your CSS in a clear way prevents unexpected style overrides and promotes better CSS architecture.
# CSS specificity and the cascade
CSS specificity is how CSS decides which styles to apply to which elements. The different selectors you can use  determine the specificity of any style rule. For example, elements are less specific than classes or attributes, which are in turn less specific than IDs. This is an elemental part of learning CSS.
Folks turn to CSS naming conventions like BEM to prevent overriding specificity unintentionally. By giving everything a single classname, everything is placed on the same specificity plane. However, it’s not always possible to maintain such organized styles, especially when working with third-party code and design systems.

    
    An illustrated example of BEM naming from keepinguptodate.com.
    

Cascade layers aim to solve this problem. They introduce a new layer to the CSS cascade. With layered styles, the precedence of a layer always beats the specificity of a selector.
For example, the selector .post a.link has higher specificity than .card a. If trying to style a link, inside a card, within a post you will find that the more specific selector will be applied.
By using @layer, you can be more explicit about the style-specificity of each, and make sure that your card link’s styles override the post link’s styles, even though the specificity might numerically be lower if all your CSS was on the same plane. This is because of cascade precedence. Layered styles create new cascade &quot;planes.&quot;



# @layer in action

    
    See demo on Codepen.
    

This example showcases the power of cascade layers, using @layer. There are several links shown: some without any additional class names applied, one with a .link class, and one with a .pink class. The CSS then adds three layers: base, typography, and utilities as follows:
@layer base {  a {    font-weight: 800;    color: red; /* ignored */  }  .link {    color: blue; /* ignored */  }}@layer typography {  a {    color: green; /* styles *all* links */  }}@layer utilities {  .pink {    color: hotpink;  /* styles *all* .pink&#039;s */  }}
Ultimately, all the links are either green or pink. This is because: while .link has a higher selector-level specificity than a, there is a color style on a in a higher-precedence @layer. a { color: green } overrides .link { color: blue } when the green rule is in a layer after the blue rule.
Layer precedence beats the element specificity.
# Organizing layers
You can organize layers directly on the page, as shown above, or you can organize them at the top of a file.
Layer order is established by the first time each layer name appears in your code.
That means, if you add the following to the top of the file, the links would all appear red, and the link with class .link would appear blue:
@layer utilities, typography, base;
This is because the layer order is now reversed, putting utilities first and base last. Hence, the style rules in the base layer will always have a higher specificity than the style rules in the typography layer. They are no longer going to be green links, but instead red or blue.

    
    See demo on Codepen.
    


ITCSS, or inverted-triangle CSS, is Harry Robert’s invention of a CSS methodology that helps with ideal style organization with the fewest overrides and complexities. This is an ideal way to structure your layered styles: from least to most specific, and a great convention to follow when writing layered styles.

# Organizing imports
Another way to use @layer is with import files. You can do this directly when you import styles, using a layer() function as in the following example.:
/* Base */@import &#039;../styles/base/normalize.css&#039; layer(base); /* normalize or rest file */@import &#039;../styles/base/base.css&#039; layer(base); /* body and base styles */@import &#039;../styles/base/theme.css&#039; layer(theme); /* theme variables */@import &#039;../styles/base/typography.css&#039; layer(theme); /* theme typography */@import &#039;../styles/base/utilities.css&#039; layer(utilities); /* base utilities *//* Layouts */@import &#039;../styles/components/post.css&#039; layer(layouts); /* post layout *//* Components */@import &#039;../styles/components/cards.css&#039; layer(components); /* imports card */@import &#039;../styles/components/footer.css&#039; layer(components); /* footer component */
The above code snippet has three layers: base,layouts, and components. The normalize, theme, and typography files in base, with a post file in layouts, and cards and footer both in components. On import of the file, the layers are instantiated using the layer function. An alternative approach would be to organize your layers at the top of the file, declaring them before any imports:
@layer base,       theme,       layouts,       components,       utilities;
Now, the order in which you @import your styles won’t matter to the layer order, since it’s already established at the first instance of the layer name. That&#039;s one less thing to worry about. You can still set imported files to specific layers, but the ordering is already established.

    
    Explore the project on Codepen.
    


Importing styles in a CSS file like this chain as they load, so it&#039;s more performant to include everything in a style tag within your HTML. Stylesheets included via link are the most performant, but don&#039;t currently have the ability to load as layers. This is currently an open issue with the WHATWG.

# Layers and the cascade
Let’s take a step back and see where layers are used as it relates to the wider cascade:

The order of precedence is such:

User Agent normal (lowest precedence)
Local User @layer
Local User normal
Author @layers
Author normal
Author !important
Author @layer !important
Local User !important
User Agent !important** (highest precedence)

You may notice here that @layer !important styles are inverted. Instead of being less specific than non-layered (normal) styles, they have higher precedence. This is because of how !important works in the cascade: it breaks the normal cascading in your stylesheets and reverses the normal layer-level specificity (precedence).
# Nested layers
Layers can also be nested within other layers. The following example comes from the Cascade Layers explainer from Miriam Suzanne:
@layer default {  p { max-width: 70ch; }}@layer framework {  @layer default {    p { margin-block: 0.75em; }  }  p { margin-bottom: 1em; }}
In the above code snippet, you can access framework.default, using a . as a signifier of the default layer being nested within framework. You can also write this in a more shorthand format:
@layer.default {  p { margin-block: 0.75em }}
The resulting layers and layer-order are:

default
framework.default
framework unlayered
unlayered


Shadow DOM: Layers encapsulated within the shadow DOM do not cross the Shadow DOM boundary. Therefore, identically named layers in the shadow DOM have no impact on the order of layers in the light DOM and vice versa.

# Things to look out for
Cascade layers can be great if you use them correctly, but they can also create additional confusion and unexpected results. Look out for the following when working with cascade layers:
# Rule 1: Don’t use @layer for scoping
Cascade layers do not solve scoping. If you have  a CSS file with an @layer, say card.css and want to style all of the links within card, do not write styles like:
a {  …}
This will lead to all of the a tags in your file getting this override. It’s still important to scope your styles properly:
.card a {  …}
# Rule 2: cascade layers are ordered behind non-layered CSS
It’s important to note that a layered CSS file will not override non-layered CSS. This was an intentional decision to make it easier to introduce layers in a more sensible way to work with your existing codebase. Using a reset.css file, for example, is a good starting point and use case for cascade layers.
# Rule 3: !important inverts cascade specificity
While layered styles are less specific than unlayered styles in general, using !important reverses this. In a layer, declarations with the !important rule are more specific than unlayered styles.
In that case, the !important styles invert their specificity. The diagram above shows this for reference: author @layers have less precedence than author normal which have less precedence than author !important which have less precedence than author @layer !important.
If you have multiple layers, the first layer with !important would take the !important precedence and be the most specific style.
# Rule 4: Understand injection points
Since layer order is established by the first time each layer name appears in your code, if you put an @layer declaration after importing and setting layer()’s, or after a different @layer statement, it can be ignored. Unlike in CSS, where the style rule furthest down on the page is applied for cascade layers, order is established at first instance.
This can be in a list, in a layer block, or in an import. If you put @layer after an import list with layer(), it won’t do anything. Putting it at the top of the file will make it set the layer order, and help you clearly see the layers within the architecture.
# Rule #5: Watch your specificity
With cascade layers, a less-specific selector (like a) will override a more-specific selector (like .link) if that less-specific selector is on a more specific layer. Consider the following:
a in layer(components) would override .pink in layer(utilities) if: @layer utilities, components was specified. While an intentional part of the API, this could be confusing and frustrating if you’re not expecting it.
So if you’re writing utility classes, always include them as a higher-order layer than the components you intend to override them with. You might think “I just added this .pink class to change the color and it&#039;s not being applied”.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z">2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">For a long time, you had to resort to custom widget libraries or hacks to show a
date picker. The web platform now ships with the HTMLInputElement showPicker() method,
a canonical way to show a browser picker not only for dates, but also time,
color, and files.
# Background
A frequent request we hear from web developers is:

  
    How do I programmatically
    show a picker for controls like date?
  
  
    Stack Overflow
  

Current answers are not great; they rely on external libraries, CSS hacks, or
specific browser behaviors like simulating a user interaction with click().
I&#039;m happy to share that those days will be over soon as the web platform is
introducing a canonical way to show a browser picker for &lt;input&gt; elements with
these types: &quot;date&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;week&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;datetime-local&quot;,
&quot;color&quot;, and &quot;file&quot;. It will also work for &lt;input&gt; elements with
suggestions powered by &lt;datalist&gt; or &quot;autocomplete&quot; which we&#039;ll cover as
well in this article.


  Browser date pickers in Chrome desktop, Chrome mobile, Safari desktop, Safari mobile, and Firefox desktop (July 2021).


Unlike a third-party picker widget, a browser picker is familiar to the user,
has great platform-specific support, and is always maintained as part of the
browser.

# How to show a picker
Calling showPicker() on an &lt;input&gt; element shows a browser picker to the
user. It must be called in response to a user gesture such as a touch gesture or
mouse click; otherwise it will fail with a NotAllowedError exception.
For security reasons, it will throw a SecurityError exception when
it&#039;s called in a cross-origin iframe.
A browser picker is shown when the &lt;input&gt; element is one of these types:
&quot;date&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;week&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;datetime-local&quot;, &quot;color&quot;, or
&quot;file&quot;.
The example below shows you how to open a browser date picker.
&lt;input type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;&lt;button&gt;Show the date picker&lt;/button&gt;&lt;script&gt;  const button = document.querySelector(&quot;button&quot;);  const dateInput = document.querySelector(&quot;input&quot;);  button.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; {    try {      dateInput.showPicker();      // A date picker is shown.    } catch (error) {      // Use external library when this fails.    }  });&lt;/script&gt;
A browser picker can also be prepopulated with items from &lt;datalist&gt; or
&quot;autocomplete&quot;.
The example below shows you how to open a browser picker with &lt;datalist&gt;.
&lt;datalist id=&quot;ice-cream-flavors&quot;&gt;  &lt;option value=&quot;Chocolate&quot;&gt; &lt;/option&gt;  &lt;option value=&quot;Coconut&quot;&gt; &lt;/option&gt;  &lt;option value=&quot;Mint&quot;&gt; &lt;/option&gt;  &lt;option value=&quot;Strawberry&quot;&gt; &lt;/option&gt;  &lt;option value=&quot;Vanilla&quot;&gt; &lt;/option&gt;&lt;/datalist&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; list=&quot;ice-cream-flavors&quot;&gt;&lt;button&gt;Show the suggestions&lt;/button&gt;&lt;script&gt;  const button = document.querySelector(&quot;button&quot;);  const iceCreamFlavorsInput = document.querySelector(&quot;input&quot;);  button.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; {    try {      iceCreamFlavorsInput.showPicker();      // A picker containing some ice cream flavors is shown.    } catch (error) {      // Use external library when this fails.    }  });&lt;/script&gt;
# Feature detection
To check if showPicker() is supported, use:
if (&#039;showPicker&#039; in HTMLInputElement.prototype) {  // showPicker() is supported.}
# Demo
A demo is available at https://show-picker.glitch.me/demo.html for you
to play with all pickers supported by the browser.
          
# Browser support
showPicker() is available in Chrome 99 or later.
# What&#039;s next
At the time of writing, showPicker() is new to the web platform. The feature
may need additional work in the future:

We may want to add a similar showPicker() to the &lt;select&gt; element in the
future, if web developers ask for it.
It&#039;s possible closePicker() might be useful, and we could consider adding
that if web developers ask for it.
We could add a permissions policy which allows cross-origin iframes to show
browser pickers when their parent chain allows them to do so.

# Feedback
The Chrome team and the web standards community want to hear about your
experiences with showPicker().

# Who is this article for?
This post is a technical reference to the current iteration of the experimental FLEDGE API.


The FLEDGE API is a less technical overview of the proposal.


The FLEDGE demo provides a walkthrough of a basic FLEDGE
deployment.



🔎 There is a glossary of FLEDGE terms at the end of The FLEDGE API


# What is FLEDGE?
FLEDGE is a Privacy Sandbox proposal to serve
remarketing and custom audience use cases, designed so that it cannot be used by
third parties to track user browsing behavior across sites. The API enables on-device auctions by
the browser, to choose relevant ads for websites the user has previously visited.
FLEDGE is the first experiment to be implemented in Chromium within the
TURTLEDOVE family of proposals.
The diagram below provides an overview of the FLEDGE lifecycle:
view a larger version.

  



# How can I try FLEDGE?
# FLEDGE demo
A walkthrough of a basic FLEDGE deployment across a shopping, travel and publisher site is
available at fledge-demo.glitch.me.

Plans for the first FLEDGE origin trial are
under discussion.
Proposed First FLEDGE Origin Trial Details
provides more details about the goals of the trial and what features are proposed for support.


# Test with feature flags
The current iteration of FLEDGE is not yet available in an origin trial, but can be tested by a
single user running a current version of Chrome, Chrome Beta or Chrome Canary with feature flags
set from the command line.

This is the in-progress version of FLEDGE for early testing, so it should not be considered
feature complete or indicative of the final implementation.
FLEDGE progress and status are discussed in the regular WICG meetings. The
minutes
for the 2021-05-12 WICG call provide detail on what is and is not supported in the current
implementation.
Run Chromium with flags
explains how to set flags when running Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers from the command
line.

The Privacy Sandbox timeline provides implementation timing
information for FLEDGE and other Privacy Sandbox proposals.
# Frames and fenced frames
When enabling FLEDGE for testing with feature flags, ads can be rendered in an &lt;iframe&gt; or a
&lt;fencedframe&gt;, depending on which flags are
set.
Using &lt;fencedframe&gt; to render ads:
--enable-features=InterestGroupStorage,AdInterestGroupAPI,Fledge,FencedFrames
Using &lt;iframe&gt; to render ads:
--enable-features=InterestGroupStorage,AdInterestGroupAPI,Fledge,AllowURNsInIframes --disable-features=FencedFrames
# What features are supported behind these feature flags in the latest version of Chrome?
FLEDGE is being made available behind feature flags in Chromium as a first
experiment to test the following features of the FLEDGE proposal:

Interest groups: stored by the browser, with associated metadata to configure ad bidding
and rendering.
On-device bidding by buyers (DSP or advertiser): based on stored interest groups and signals
from the seller.
On-device ad selection by the seller (SSP or publisher): based on auction bids and
metadata from buyers.
Ad rendering in a temporarily relaxed version of Fenced Frames: with network access and
logging allowed for ad rendering.

The API explainer provides more detail
about feature support and constraints.
# Interest group permissions
The default in the current implementation of FLEDGE is to allow calling joinAdInterestGroup() from
anywhere in a page, even from cross-domain iframes. In the future, once site owners have had time
to adjust their cross-domain iframe permissions policies, the plan is to disallow calls from
cross-domain iframes, as the explainer describes.
# Trusted servers
As part of a FLEDGE ad auction, the browser can access a
trusted server
that returns simple key-value pairs to provide information to an ad buyer, such as remaining
campaign budget. The FLEDGE proposal mandates
that this server &quot;performs no event-level logging and has no other side effects based on these
requests&quot;.  However, in the current initial experimental phase for testing FLEDGE, the seller
and buyers can run trusted servers themselves (a
&quot;Bring Your Own Server&quot;
model). Discussion is underway about how trusted servers are managed and owned.

# Debug FLEDGE worklets
From Chrome Canary 98.0.4718.0, it&#039;s possible to debug FLEDGE worklets within Chrome DevTools.
The first step is to set breakpoints via a new category in the Event Listener Breakpoints pane
in the Sources panel.

When a breakpoint triggers, execution is paused before the first statement at the top-level of the
worklet script. You can use regular breakpoints or step commands to get to the bidding/scoring/reporting
function itself.
Live worklet scripts will also show up under the Threads panel.

Since some worklets may run in parallel, multiple threads may end up in the &quot;paused&quot; state there;
you can use the thread list to switch between threads, and resume or inspect them more closely as
appropriate.

# How does the FLEDGE API work?
In this example, a user browses the website of a custom bike maker, then later visits a news website
and is shown an ad for a new bike from the bike maker.
Warning
Not all features described in this post have been implemented (or fully implemented) in the version
of the FLEDGE API currently being tested in Chrome. Test with feature flags
explains what FLEDGE features are currently available for testing in Chrome run from the command line
using feature flags.
We expect the features of FLEDGE will be added over time as work on implementation continues. Once
the API reaches the origin trial stage, we&#039;ll provide a regularly-updated list of which parts are
already implemented and what&#039;s still in progress.

# 1. A user visits an advertiser site

Imagine that a user visits the website of a custom bike maker (the advertiser in
this example) and spends some time on the product page for a handmade steel bike. This provides the
bike maker with a remarketing opportunity.
Key Term
A demand-side platform (DSP) is an adtech service used to automate ad purchasing. DSPs are
used by advertisers to buy ad impressions
across a range of publisher sites. Publishers put their ad inventory up for sale
through marketplaces called ad exchanges, and DSPs decide programmatically which available ad
impression makes most sense for an advertiser to buy.
A supply-side platform (SSP) is an adtech service used to automate selling ad inventory. SSPs
allow publishers to offer their inventory (empty rectangles where ads will go) to multiple ad
exchanges, DSPs, and networks. This enables a wide range of potential buyers to bid for ad space.

⬇︎
# 2. The user&#039;s browser is asked to add an interest group

Explainer section: Browsers Record Interest Groups
The advertiser&#039;s demand-side platform (DSP) (or the advertiser itself) calls
navigator.joinAdInterestGroup() to ask the browser to add an interest group to the list of groups
the browser is a member of. In this example, the group is named custom-bikes, and the owner is
dsp.example. The interest group owner (in this case, the DSP) will be a buyer
in the ad auction described in step 4. Interest group membership is stored by the
browser, on the user&#039;s device, and is not shared with the browser vendor or anyone else.
joinAdInterestGroup() requires permission from:

The site being visited
The interest group owner

For example: it must not be possible for malicious.example to call
joinAdInterestGroup() with dsp.example as owner without the permission of
dsp.example.
# Permission from the site being visited
Same origin: By default, permission is implicitly granted for joinAdInterestGroup() calls from
the same origin as the site being visited, i.e. from the same origin as the top-level frame of the
current page. Sites can use a FLEDGE permissions policy header
join-ad-interest-group directive to disable joinAdInterestGroup() calls.
Cross origin: Calling joinAdInterestGroup() from origins that are different from the current
page can only succeed if the site being visited has set a permissions policy that allows calls to
joinAdInterestGroup() from cross-origin iframes.

The default in the current implementation of FLEDGE is to allow calls to joinAdInterestGroup()
from anywhere in a page, even from cross-origin iframes. In the future, once site owners have had
time to adjust their permissions policies, the plan is by default to disallow calls from
cross-origin iframes, as described in the FLEDGE explainer.

# Permission from the interest group owner
Interest group owner permission is implicitly granted by calling joinAdInterestGroup()
from an iframe with the same origin as that of the interest group&#039;s owner. For example, a dsp.example
iframe can call joinAdInterestGroup() for interest groups owned by dsp.example.
The proposal is that joinAdInterestGroup() can run in a page or iframe in the owner&#039;s domain, or
be delegated to other domains provided using a list at a .well-known URL.
# Using navigator.joinAdInterestGroup()
Here&#039;s an example of how the API might be used:

const interestGroup = {  owner: &#039;https://dsp.example&#039;,  name: &#039;custom-bikes&#039;,  biddingLogicUrl: ...,  dailyUpdateUrl: ...,  trustedBiddingSignalsUrl: ...,  trustedBiddingSignalsKeys: [&#039;key1&#039;, &#039;key2&#039;],  userBiddingSignals: {...},  ads: [bikeAd1, bikeAd2, bikeAd3],  adComponents: [customBike1, customBike2, bikePedal, bikeFrame1, bikeFrame2],};navigator.joinAdInterestGroup(interestGroup, 7 * kSecsPerDay);
The interestGroup object passed to the function must be no more than 50 kiB in size, otherwise the
call will fail. The second parameter specifies the duration of the interest group, capped at 30
days. Successive calls overwrite previously stored values.
# Interest group properties

        dailyUpdateUrl**
        Optional
        &#039;https://dsp.example/bid/custom-bikes/update&#039;
        URL that returns JSON to update interest group attributes.
        (See Update the interest group.)
      
      
        trustedBiddingSignalsUrl**
        Optional
        &#039;https://dsp.example/trusted/bidding-signals&#039;
        Base URL for key-value requests to bidder&#039;s trusted server.
      
      
        trustedBiddingSignalsKeys
        Optional
        [&#039;key1&#039;, &#039;key2&#039; ...]
        Keys for requests to key-value trusted server.

        adComponents
        Optional
        [customBike1, customBike2, bikePedal, bikeFrame1, bikeFrame2]
        Components for ads composed of multiple pieces.
      
    
  

* All properties are optional except for owner and name. The biddingLogicUrl and ads
properties are optional, but required to participate in an auction. There may be use cases for
creating an interest group without these properties: for example, an interest group owner might
want to add a browser to an interest group for a campaign that isn&#039;t running yet, or for some
other future use, or they may temporarily have run out of advertising budget.
** In the current implementation of FLEDGE, biddingLogicUrl, dailyUpdateUrl and
trustedBiddingSignalsUrl must have the same origin as owner. That may not be a long-term
constraint, and the ads and adComponents URLs have no such constraint.

# Update the interest group
dailyUpdateUrl specifies a web server that returns JSON defining interest group properties,
corresponding to the interest group object passed to navigator.joinAdInterestGroup(). This
provides a mechanism for the group&#039;s owner to periodically update the attributes of the
interest group. In the current implementation,
the following attributes can be changed:

biddingLogicUrl
trustedBiddingSignalsUrl
trustedBiddingSignalsKeys
ads
adComponents

Any field not specified in the JSON will not be overwritten—only fields specified in the JSON get
updated—whereas calling navigator.joinAdInterestGroup() overwrites any existing interest group.
Caution
The current implementation of FLEDGE in Chrome does not update interest groups automatically in the
background.
For the time being, updates to interest groups owned by the current frame&#039;s origin can
be triggered manually via navigator.updateAdInterestGroups(). Rate limiting prevents updates from
happening too frequently: repeated calls to navigator.updateAdInterestGroups() don&#039;t do anything
until the rate limit period (currently one day) has passed. The rate limit gets reset if
navigator.joinAdInterestGroup() is called again for the same interest group owner and name.

# Specify ads for an interest group
ads and adComponents objects include a URL for an ad creative and, optionally, arbitrary
metadata that can be used at bidding time. For example:
{  renderUrl: &#039;https://cdn.example/.../bikeAd1.html&#039;,  metadata: bikeAd1metadata // optional}

# How do buyers make bids?
The script at biddingLogicUrl provided by an interest group owner must include a generateBid()
function. When an ad-space seller calls navigator.runAdAuction(), the generatedBid()
function is called once for each of the interest groups the browser is a member of, if the interest
group&#039;s owner is invited to bid. In other words, generateBid() is called once for each candidate
ad. When the seller calls the navigator.runAdAuction() function, they provide code that includes a
scoreAd() function. This function is run for each bidder in the auction: to score each of the bids
returned by generateBid().
Bidding code might look this very simple example:
function generateBid(interestGroup, auctionSignals, perBuyerSignals,    trustedBiddingSignals, browserSignals) {  return {    ad: {...}, // ad metadata    bid: auctionSignals.is_above_the_fold ? perBuyerSignals.atf_value : perBuyerSignals.btf_value,    render: interestGroup.ads[0].renderUrl  }}

# More about generateBid()
The script at biddingLogicUrl provided by an ad-space buyer must include a generateBid() function.
This function is called once for each candidate ad. As described later in this post, runAdAuction () individually checks each ad, along with its associated bid and metadata, then
assigns the ad a numerical desirability score.
generateBid(interestGroup, auctionSignals, perBuyerSignals,     trustedBiddingSignals, browserSignals) {  ...  return {    ad: adObject,     bid: bidValue,     render: renderUrl,    adComponents: [adComponentRenderUrl1, ...]   };}
generateBid() takes the following arguments:


interestGroup
The object passed to joinAdInterestGroup() by the ad buyer. (The interest group
may be updated via dailyUpdateUrl.)


auctionSignals
A property of the auction config argument passed to
navigator.runAdAuction() by the ad-space seller. This provides information about page context (such as
the ad size and the publisher ID), the type of auction (first-price or second-price), and other
metadata.


perBuyerSignals
As with auctionSignals, a property of the auction config
argument passed to navigator.runAdAuction() by the seller. This can provide contextual
signals from the buyer&#039;s server about the page, if the seller is an SSP which
performs a real-time bidding call to buyer servers and pipes the response back, or if the publisher
page contacts the buyer&#039;s server directly. If so, the buyer may wish to check a cryptographic
signature of those signals inside generateBid() as protection against tampering.


trustedBiddingSignals
An object whose keys are the trustedBiddingSignalsKeys for the
interest group, and whose values are returned in the trustedBiddingSignals request.


browserSignals
An object constructed by the browser, which might include information about page
context (such as the hostname of the current page, which the seller could otherwise fake) and data
for the interest group itself (such as a record of when the group previously won an auction, to allow
on-device frequency capping).


The browserSignals object has the following properties:
{   topWindowHostname: &#039;publisher.example&#039;,  seller: &#039;https://ssp.example&#039;,  joinCount: 3,  bidCount: 17,  prevWins: [[time1,ad1],[time2,ad2],...],}
generateBid() returns an object with four properties:


ad
Arbitrary metadata about the ad, such as information the seller expects to learn about this bid or
ad creative. The seller uses this information in its auction and decision
logic.


bid
A numerical bid that will enter the auction. The seller must be in a position to compare
bids from different buyers, therefore bids must be in some seller-chosen unit (e.g. &quot;USD per
thousand&quot;). If the bid is zero or negative, then this interest group will not participate in the
seller&#039;s auction at all. With this mechanism, the buyer can implement any advertiser rules for where
their ads may or may not appear.


render
A URL, or a list of URLs, that will be rendered to display the creative if this bid
wins the auction. (See Ads Composed of Multiple Pieces
in the API explainer.) The value has to match the renderUrl of one of the ads defined for the
interest group.


adComponents
An optional list of up to 20 components for
ads composed of multiple pieces,
taken from the adComponents property of the interest group argument
passed to navigator.joinAdInterestGroup().


# Asking a browser to leave an interest group
The interest group owner can request that a browser be removed from an interest group. In other
words, the browser is asked to remove the interest group from the list of those it is a member of.
navigator.leaveAdInterestGroup({  owner: &#039;https://dsp.example&#039;,  name: &#039;custom-bikes&#039;});
If a user returns to the site which asked the browser to add an interest group, the interest group owner
can call the navigator.leaveAdInterestGroup() function to request the browser remove the interest group.
Code for an ad can also call this function for its interest group.
⬇︎
# 3. The user visits a site that sells ad space

Later, the user visits a site that sells ads space, in this example a news website. The site has
ad inventory, which it sells programmatically using
real-time bidding.

There are three main roles described in the FLEDGE proposal explainer:

Advertiser: a site that pays to advertise its products. In the example here, a custom bike
maker.
Publisher: sites that sell ad space, such as the online news website referred to in the
examples here. Many (but not all) sites selling ad space are content publishers.
Seller: the party running the ad auction (in the next step). Most publishers use an adtech
service such as an SSP to optimize selling ad inventory.



⬇︎
# 4. An ad auction is run in the browser

Explainer section: Sellers Run On-Device Auctions
The ad auction is likely to be run by the publisher&#039;s SSP, or the publisher
itself. The purpose of the auction is to select the most appropriate ad for a single available ad
slot on the current page. The auction takes into account the interest groups the browser is a
member of, along with data from ad-space buyers and the seller—from trusted servers in the next
step.
The ad-space seller makes a request to the user&#039;s browser to begin an ad auction by calling
navigator.runAdAuction().
For example:
const auctionConfig = {  seller: &#039;https://ssp.example&#039;,  decisionLogicUrl: ...,  trustedScoringSignalsUrl: ...,  interestGroupBuyers: [&#039;https://dsp.example&#039;, &#039;https://buyer2.example&#039;, ...],  additionalBids: [otherSourceAd1, otherSourceAd2, ...],  auctionSignals: {...},  sellerSignals: {...},  perBuyerSignals: {    &#039;https://dsp.example&#039;: {...},    &#039;https://another-buyer.example&#039;: {...},    ...  },};const auctionResultPromise = navigator.runAdAuction(auctionConfig);
runAdAuction() returns a promise that resolves to a URN (urn:uuid:&lt;something&gt;) that represents the
ad auction outcome. This can only be decoded by the browser when passed to a fenced frame
for rendering: the publisher page cannot inspect the winning ad.
The decisionLogicUrl script considers each individual ad, along with its associated bid and
metadata, one at a time, and then assigns it a numerical desirability score.

        additionalBids**
        Optional
        [otherSourceAd1, otherSourceAd2, ...]
        Alternative ads for participation in the auction.
      
      
        auctionSignals
        Optional
        {...}
        Seller information about page context, type of auction, etc.
      
      
        sellerSignals
        Optional
        {...}
        Information based on publisher settings, making a contextual ad request, etc.
      
      
        perBuyerSignals
        Optional
        {&#039;https://dsp.example&#039;: {...},
            &#039;https://another-buyer.example&#039;: {...},
          ...}
        Contextual signals about the page for each specific buyer, from their server.
      
    
  

* The seller may specify interestGroupBuyers: &#039;*&#039; to permit all interest groups to bid.
Ads are then accepted or rejected based on criteria other than inclusion of the interest group owner.
For example, the seller may review ad creatives to confirm compliance with their policies.
** additionalBids is not supported in the current implementation of FLEDGE. Read the Auction
Participants section in the
FLEDGE explainer for more information.
# How are ads selected?
The runAdAuction() code must include a scoreAd() function, which is run once for each ad to
determine its desirability.
scoreAd(adMetadata, bid, auctionConfig, trustedScoringSignals, browserSignals) {  ...  return desirabilityScoreForThisAd;}
scoreAd() takes the following arguments:

adMetadata
Arbitrary metadata provided by the buyer.
bid
A numerical bid value.
auctionConfig
The auction configuration object passed to navigator.runAdAuction().
trustedScoringSignals
Values retrieved at auction time from the seller&#039;s trusted server,
representing the seller&#039;s opinion of the ad.
browserSignals
An object constructed by the browser, including information that the browser
knows and which the seller&#039;s auction script might want to verify:

{   topWindowHostname: &#039;publisher.example&#039;,  interestGroupOwner: &#039;https://dsp.example&#039;,  renderUrl: &#039;https://cdn.example/render&#039;,  adComponentRenderUrls: [&#039;https://cdn.com/ad-component-1&#039;,...],  biddingDurationMsec: 12}
Before an auction starts, the seller finds the best contextual ad for the available ad slot. Part of
its scoreAd() logic is to reject any ad that can&#039;t beat the contextual winner.
⬇︎
# 5. The seller and participating buyers receive realtime data from trusted servers

Explainer section: Fetching Real-Time Data from a Trusted Server
During an ad auction, the ad-space seller can get realtime data about specific ad creatives by
making a request to a trusted server using the trustedScoringSignalsUrl property of
auction config argument passed to navigator.runAdAuction(), along with the keys
from the renderUrl properties of all entries in the ads and adComponents fields of all
interest groups in the auction.
Likewise, an ad-space buyer can request realtime data from a trusted server using the
trustedBiddingSignalsUrl and trustedBiddingSignalsKeys properties of the interest group argument
passed to navigator.joinAdInterestGroup(). The URL for an ad buyer request to a trusted server
might look like this:
https://trusted-server.example/getvalues?hostname=publisher.example&amp;keys=key1,key2
A request to this URL is made when runAdAuction() is called:

The base URL comes from trustedBiddingSignalsUrl.
The hostname is provided by the browser.
The keys value is taken from trustedBiddingSignalsKeys.

The response to this request is a JSON object providing values for each of the keys.
⬇︎
# 6. The winning ad is displayed

Explainer section: Browsers Render the Winning Ad
As described earlier: the promise returned by runAdAuction() resolves to an URN
which is passed to a fenced frame for rendering, and the site displays
the winning ad.
⬇︎
# 7. The auction result is reported
Explainer section: Event-Level Reporting (for now)

The long-term plan is to enable the browser to report auction results for the seller and buyers
using aggregate reporting APIs.
As a temporary event-level reporting mechanism, the code implementing reportResult() for the
seller, and reportWin() for the winning bidder, can call the sendReportTo() function. This takes
a single argument: a string representing a URL that is fetched after the auction completes, which
encodes event-level information to be reported.

# Seller reports outcome
Explainer section: Seller Reporting on Render

The seller&#039;s JavaScript provided at decisionLogicUrl (which also provided scoreAd()) can
include a reportResult() function, to report the auction outcome.
reportResult(auctionConfig, browserSignals) {  ...  return signalsForWinner;}
The arguments passed to this function are:


auctionConfig
The auction configuration object passed to navigator.runAdAuction().


browserSignals 
An object constructed by the browser providing information about the auction.
For example:
{   &#039;topWindowHostname&#039;: &#039;publisher.example&#039;,  &#039;interestGroupOwner&#039;: &#039;https://dsp.example&#039;,  &#039;renderUrl&#039;: &#039;https://cdn.example/url-of-winning-creative.wbn&#039;,  &#039;bid:&#039; &lt;bidValue&gt;,  &#039;desirability&#039;: &lt;winningAdScore&gt;}


The return value of this function is used as the sellerSignals argument for the winning bidder&#039;s
reportWin() function.
# Winning bidder reports outcome
Explainer section: Buyer Reporting on Render and Ad Events
The winning bidder&#039;s JavaScript (which also provided generateBid()) can include a
reportWin() function to report the auction outcome.
reportWin(auctionSignals, perBuyerSignals, sellerSignals, browserSignals) {  ...}
The arguments passed to this function are:


auctionSignals and perBuyerSignals
The same values passed to generateBid() for the winning bidder.


sellerSignals
The return value of reportResult(), which gives the seller an
opportunity to pass information to the buyer.


browserSignals
An object constructed by the browser providing information about the auction.
For example:
{   &#039;topWindowHostname&#039;: &#039;publisher.example&#039;,  &#039;seller&#039;: &#039;https://ssp.example&#039;,  &#039;interestGroupOwner&#039;: &#039;https://dsp.example&#039;,  &#039;interestGroupName&#039;: &#039;custom-bikes&#039;,  &#039;renderUrl&#039;: &#039;https://cdn.example/winning-creative.wbn&#039;,  &#039;bid:&#039; &lt;bidValue&gt;}



A reporting mechanism for losing bidders is under discussion.

# What is the difference between FLEDGE and TURTLEDOVE?

FLEDGE is the first experiment to be implemented in Chromium within the TURTLEDOVE family of proposals.
FLEDGE follows TURTLEDOVE&#039;s high-level principles. Some online advertising has been based on showing an ad to a potentially-interested person who has previously interacted with the advertiser or ad network. Historically this has worked by the advertiser recognizing a specific person as they browse across web sites, a core privacy concern with today&#039;s web.
The TURTLEDOVE effort is about offering a new API to address this use case while offering some key privacy advances:

The browser, not the advertiser, holds the information about what the advertiser thinks a
person is interested in.
Advertisers can serve ads based on an interest, but cannot combine that interest with other
information about a person — in particular, who they are or what page they are visiting.

FLEDGE grew out of TURTLEDOVE and a collection of related proposals for modifications to better served the developers who would be using the API:

In SPARROW:
Criteo proposed the addition of a trusted-server
(&quot;Gatekeeper&quot;) model.  FLEDGE includes a more limited use of trusted servers, for real-time data
lookup and aggregated reporting.​​
NextRoll&#039;s TERN and Magnite&#039;s
PARRROT
proposals described the different roles that buyers and sellers had in the on-device auction.
FLEDGE&#039;s ad bidding/scoring flow is based on this work.
RTB House&#039;s Outcome-based and
Product-level TURTLEDOVE
modifications improved the anonymity model and personalization capabilities of the on-device auction
PARAKEET is
Microsoft&#039;s proposal for a TURTLEDOVE-like ad service that relies on a trusted proxy server
between the browser and the adtech providers, to anonymize ad requests and enforce privacy
properties.  FLEDGE has not adopted this proxying model.  We are bringing the JavaScript APIs
for PARAKEET and FLEDGE into alignment, in support of future work to further combine the best
features of both proposals.

FLEDGE does not yet prevent a website&#039;s ad network from learning which ads a person sees. We expect it to modify it to become more private over time.



 
# What browser configuration is available?

Users can adjust their participation for Privacy Sandbox trials in Chrome by enabling or disabling
the top-level setting in chrome://settings/privacySandbox.  During initial testing, people will be
able to use this high-level Privacy Sandbox setting to opt out of FLEDGE. Chrome plans to allow
users to see and manage the list of interest groups that they have been added to across the web
sites they have visited.  As with the Privacy Sandbox technologies themselves, user settings may
evolve with feedback from users, regulators and others.
We&#039;ll continue to update the available settings in Chrome as the FLEDGE proposal progresses, based
on tests and feedback.
In the future, we plan to offer more granular settings to manage FLEDGE and associated data.
API callers can&#039;t access group membership when users browse in Incognito mode, and membership is
removed when users clear their site data.



# Engage and share feedback

Group.

# Preview feature: Full-page accessibility tree
The new Full-page accessibility tree makes it easier for you to get an overview of the full-page accessibility tree and help you better understand how your web content is exposed to assistive technology.
In the Elements panel, open the Accessibility pane and select Enable full-page accessibility tree checkbox. Then, reload DevTools and you will see a new accessibility button in the Elements panel.
You can click on it to toggle to the Full-page accessibility tree view. You can expand nodes or click to see details in the  Accessibility pane.
Select a node and toggle back to the DOM tree view. The corresponding DOM node is selected now. This is a great way to understand the mapping between the DOM node and its accessibility tree node. This works for DOM tree ⬌ Accessibility tree view too!
Previously, the accessibility tree was available in the Accessibility pane. The view is limited, it only enables you to explore a single node and its ancestors.
Our team is still actively working on this preview feature. We are looking for your feedback for further enhancements!

Chromium issue: 887173
# More precise changes in the Changes tab
The code changes in the Changes tab is pretty-printed automatically.
Previously, it was hard to trace the actual changes of minified source code because all the code is shown in a single line.

Chromium issues: 1238818, 1268754 , 1086491
# Set longer timeout for user flow recording
You can now adjust the Timeout settings in the Recorder for all steps or a specific step. This is useful especially for pages with slow network requests and lengthy animation.
For example, I recorded a user flow on this demo page to load and click on the menu item. However, the loading of the menu items is slow (it takes 6 seconds). The replay of this user flow failed because it exceeds 5 seconds  (the default timeout).
We can use the new Timeout settings to fix this. Expand the step which we click on the menu item. Edit the step by  Add timeout and set it to 6000 milliseconds (equal to 6s).
Optionally, you can adjust the Timeout in the Replay settings for all the steps. Expand the Replay settings and edit the Timeout value.

Chromium issue: 1257499
# Ensure your pages are cacheable with the Back/forward cache tab
Back/forward cache (or bfcache) is a browser optimization that enables instant back and forward navigation.
The new Back/forward cache tab can help you test your pages to ensure they&#039;re optimized for bfcache, and identify any issues that may be preventing them from being eligible.
To test a particular page, navigate to it in Chrome and then in DevTools go to Application &gt; Back-forward Cache. Next, click the Test back/forward cache button and DevTools will attempt to navigate away and back to determine whether the page could be restored from bfcache.
As web developers, it&#039;s critical to know how to optimize your pages for bfcache across all browsers because it will significantly improve the browsing experience for users—especially those with slower networks or devices.

Chromium issue: 1110752
# New Properties pane filter
If you want to focus on a specific property in the Properties pane, you can now type that property name or value in the new Filter textbox.
By default, properties whose value is null or undefined are not shown. Enable the Show all checkbox to view all properties.
These enhancements allow you to get to the properties you care for quicker and thus improve your productivity!

Chromium issue: 1269674
# Emulate the CSS forced-colors media feature
The forced-colors CSS media feature is used to detect if the user agent has enabled a forced colors mode (e.g. Windows High Contrast mode) where it enforces a user-chosen limited color palette on the page.
Open the Command Menu, run the Show Rendering command, and then set the Emulate CSS media feature forced-colors dropdown.

Chromium issue: 1130859
# Show rulers on hover command
You can now open the Command Menu and run the Show rulers on hover command. The page rulers make it easier to measure the width and height of an element.
Previously, you can only enable the page rulers via Settings &gt; Show rulers checkbox.

Chromium issue: 1270562
# Support row-reverse and column-reverse in the Flexbox editor
The Flexbox editor added two new buttons to support row-reverse and column-reverse in flex-direction.

Chromium issue: 1263866
# New keyboard shortcuts to replay XHR and expand all search results
# Keyboard shortcuts to replay XHR in the Network panel
Select a XHR request in the Network panel and press R on the keyboard to replay the XHR. Previously, you can only replay the XHR via the context menu (right click &gt; Replay XHR)

Chromium issue: 1050021
# Keyboard shortcut to expand all search results
A new shortcut is added in the Search tab allowing you to expand and collapse all the search results. Previously, you could only expand and collapse the search results by clicking on one file at a time.
Open the search tab via Esc &gt; 3-dot menu &gt; Search. Enter a search string (e.g. function) and press Enter to see the list of search results. Focus on the search results and use the following shortcut to expand/collapse the search files:

Windows / Linux - Ctrl + Shift + { or }
MacOS - Cmd + Options + { or }

Go to the keyboard shortcuts for reference of keyboard shortcuts in Chrome DevTools.
          
Chromium issue: 1255073
# Lighthouse 9 in the Lighthouse panel
The Lighthouse panel is now running Lighthouse 9. Lighthouse will now list all the elements sharing the same id.
Non-unique element id is a common accessibility problem. For instance, the id referenced in an aria-labelledby attribute is used on multiple elements.
Check out the What’s new in Lighthouse 9.0 for more details on the updates.
​
Chromium issue: 772558
# Improved Sources panel
Loads of stability improvements in the Sources panel as we upgraded it to use CodeMirror 6. Here are few notable improvements:

Significantly faster when opening large files (e.g. WASM, JavaScript)
No more random scrolling when stepping through code
Improved auto-complete suggestions for editable sources (e.g. snippets, local override)

Chromium issue: 1241848
# Miscellaneous highlights
These are some noteworthy fixes in this release:

Properly displaying the waterfall diagram of network requests. Previously, the style was broken. (1275501)
The code highlight was broken when searching in documents with very long lines in the Sources panel. It’s now fixed. (1275496)
No more duplicate Payload tab in network requests. (1273972)
Fixed the missing layout shifts details in the Summary section of the Performance panel. (1259606)
Support arbitrary characters (e.g. ,, .),  in Network Search queries. (1267196)

# [Experimental] Endpoints in the Reporting API pane

To enable the experiment, check the Enable Reporting API panel in the Application panel checkbox under Settings &gt; Experiments.

The experimental Reporting API pane was introduced in Chrome 96 to help you monitor the reports generated on your page and their status.
The Endpoints section is now available. It gives you an overview of all the endpoints configured in the Reporting-Endpoints header.
Learn to use the Reporting API to monitor security violations, deprecated API calls, and more.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z">2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Warning
If your website relies on relaxing the same-origin policy via document.domain,
your action is required. Continue to read more about why this is changing or
skip to alternative code for cross-origin
communication

document.domain
was designed to get or set the origin&#039;s hostname.
On Chrome, websites will be unable to set document.domain. They will need to
use alternative approaches such as postMessage() or Channel Messaging API to
communicate cross-origin. We&#039;re targeting Chrome 101 to ship this change at the
earliest, but this is dependent on the response to the Intent to
Ship.
If your website relies on same-origin policy relaxation via document.domain
to function correctly, the site will need to send an Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0
header, as will all other documents that require that behavior (note that
document.domain has no effect if only one document sets it).
# Why make document.domain immutable?
Many websites set document.domain to allow communication between same-site
but cross-origin pages.
Key Term
Same-site but cross-origin sites have the same
eTLD+1
but different subdomains.

Here&#039;s how it&#039;s used:
Let&#039;s say a page on https://parent.example.com embeds an iframe page from
https://video.example.com. These pages have the same eTLD+1 (example.com)
with different subdomains. When both pages&#039; document.domain is set to
&#039;example.com&#039;, the browser treats the two origins as if they are same-origin.
Set the document.domain for https://parent.example.com:
// Confirm the current origin of &quot;parent.example.com&quot;console.log(document.domain);// Set the document.domaindocument.domain = &#039;example.com&#039;;console.log(document.domain);
Set the document.domain for https://video.example.com:
// Confirm the current origin of &quot;video.example.com&quot;console.log(document.domain);// Set the document.domaindocument.domain = &#039;example.com&#039;;console.log(document.domain);
You could now create a cross-origin DOM manipulation on
https://parent.example.com against https://video.example.com.
Websites set document.domain to make it possible for same-site documents to
communicate more easily. Because this change relaxes the same-origin
policy,
the parent page is able to access the iframe&#039;s document and traverse the
DOM tree, and vice versa.
This is a convenient technique, however it introduces a security risk.
# Security concerns with document.domain
Security concerns around document.domain have led to a change in the
specification that warns users to avoid using
it.
The current discussion with other browser
vendors is moving in
the same direction.
For example, if a hosting service provides different subdomains per user, an
attacker can set document.domain to pretend they are the same-origin
as another user&#039;s page. Further, an attacker can host a website under a shared
hosting service, which serves sites through the same IP address with different
port numbers. In that case, the attacker can pretend to be on the same-site-but-same-origin
as yours. This is possible because document.domain ignores the port number
part of the domain.
To learn more about the security implications of setting document.domain, read
&quot;Document.domain&quot; page on
MDN.
Chrome plans to make document.domain immutable from Chrome 101.
# Alternative cross-origin communication
At this time, you have two options to replace document.domain for your website.
# Use postMessage() or Channel Messaging API
In most use cases, cross-origin
postMessage()
or Channel Messaging API
can replace document.domain.
In the following example:

https://parent.example.com requests https://video.example.com within an
iframe to manipulate DOM by sending a message via postMessage().
https://video.example.com manipulates DOM as soon as it receives the
message and notify the success back to the parent.
https://parent.example.com acknowledges the success.

On https://parent.example.com:
// Send a message to https://video.example.comiframe.postMessage(&#039;Request DOM manipulation&#039;, &#039;https://video.example.com&#039;);// Receive messagesiframe.addEventListener(&#039;message&#039;, (event) =&gt; {  // Reject all messages except ones from https://video.example.com  if (event.origin !== &#039;https://video.example.com&#039;) return;  // Filter success messages  if (event.data === &#039;succeeded&#039;) {    // DOM manipulation is succeeded  }});
On https://video.example.com:
// Receive messageswindow.addEventListener(&#039;message&#039;, (event) =&gt; {  // Reject all messages except ones from https://parent.example.com  if (event.origin !== &#039;https://parent.example.com&#039;) return;  // Do a DOM manipulation on https://video.example.com.  // Send a success message to https://parent.example.com  event.source.postMessage(&#039;succeeded&#039;, event.origin);});
Try it and see how it works. If you have specific requirements that won&#039;t work
with postMessage() or Channel Messaging API, let us know on Twitter via
@ChromiumDev or ask on Stack Overflow with a
document.domain
tag.
# Send Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0 header to continue using document.domain
If you have strong reasons to continue setting document.domain, you can send
Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0 response header along with the target document.
Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0
The Origin-Agent-Cluster header instructs the browser whether the document
should be handled by the origin-keyed agent cluster or not. To learn more about
Origin-Agent-Cluster, read Requesting performance isolation with the
Origin-Agent-Cluster header.
When you send this header, your document can continue to set document.domain
even after it becomes immutable by default.
# Browser compatibility

The Origin
specification,
states that the feature should be removed.
WebKit indicated that they are moderately positive about deprecating
document.domain
setter.

    <p class="article__summary">
Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.

Chrome 98 beta was released on January 6, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in early February, 2022.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. Its usage in Chrome has declined
significantly over the last year. SDES is
removed because it is a
security problem. It exposes session keys to Javascript, which means that
entities with access to the negotiation exchange, or with the ability to subvert
the Javascript, can decrypt the media sent over the connection.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:

They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.

Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#039;s,
essentially:

Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.

You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">Welcome to the 2021 wrap-up edition of Progress in the Privacy
Sandbox, tracking the milestones on
the path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more
private web. Normally, we share an overview of updates to the Privacy Sandbox
timeline along with news from across
the project, but December was a quiet month. Instead, we&#039;ll look back at some of
the activities over 2021 and provide a few potential resolutions you can make
now we are in the new year.
# Chromium development process
For a new web platform feature to land in Chromium, it needs to go through the
project&#039;s open development
process. In 2021, the
Privacy Sandbox team produced:

  
  🥚Intent to Prototype      19
  🧪Intent to Experiment 7
  🚀Intent to Ship           11
  
  
    Source
  

Each milestone is also an invitation for the wider web ecosystem to contribute.
An Intent to Prototype is the first checkpoint, where we invite discussion
and early experimentation. This means a proposal will be available on GitHub,
where you can ask a question by creating an Issue or join discussions and
presentations in standards
groups such as the W3C and
IETF. This is also where coding begins, which means you can expect the
prototype functionality to be made available for developer testing behind a
feature
flag.
Initial feedback is critical for validating and iterating on proposals.
An Intent to Experiment is an optional step if we’d like to request an
origin trial. Developers can sign up for the origin
trial of a feature, and then test it in production.
It&#039;s called an experiment because we have specific aspects of the feature we
want to validate in real-world environments. Developers that can test and
share the results of those tests provide valuable feedback to help iterate and
evolve the feature.
An Intent to Ship is the final milestone which signals that a feature is now
complete and ready for general availability. Once approved, the feature is
merged into an upcoming release and then progresses through the Canary, Beta,
and Stable channels. It&#039;s critical to ensure you test your sites with the
Canary and
Beta versions of Chrome to catch and
report any bugs before a feature reaches Stable.
# Proposals
Each Privacy Sandbox proposal has an accompanying GitHub repository. A
repository hosts an explainer to summarize overall functionality, a detailed
specification for implementation by browsers, and contributions from across the
web ecosystem in the form of Issues and Pull Requests.
Across 14 Privacy Sandbox repositories, we had:

  
    💬545Issues created
                           250Issues closed
    🛠️261Pull Requests created
                           223Pull Requests merged
  
  
    Source
  

The language in explainers and specifications is often targeted to an audience
already familiar with standards and browser development, which can be
challenging if you&#039;re unfamiliar with it. However, the aim of an explainer is to
explain! If there are points that are unclear or not covered, we want you to
raise an Issue so we can update and clarify the explainer.
# Resolutions
# User-agent spring cleaning
As we were counting down to the New Year, we&#039;re also counting up to both
Chrome 100 and the incremental reduction
of the user-agent string. This is a good
motivator to revisit any usage of the user-agent string in your code to check if
it&#039;s affected by either of these changes.
To find those areas:

Search for navigator.userAgent in your JavaScript code, or access to the
User-Agent header in your server code.
Check your parsing of the string for assumptions about a 2 digit version. For
example, a regex that specifies \d\d or \d{2} should be replaced with
\d+.
Check your use of the string for anywhere you rely on the:

platform (operating system) version
full Chrome build version
mobile device name


These are the values that will be reduced to fixed strings in the future. If
you need access to these values, migrate to User-Agent Client
Hints.

There is one December update to mention—if you are adopting User-Agent Client
Hints, we have sent the Intent to Ship to enable delegating hints to other
origins in
HTML
via a &lt;meta&gt; tag. For example:
&lt;meta name=&quot;accept-ch&quot; content=&quot;sec-ch-ua-model=( https://foo.bar )&quot;&gt;
If you&#039;re in an enthusiastic spring cleaning mood, you can also consider
alternatives to the use of user-agent altogether. If you&#039;re using the string to
detect mobile devices, then investigate if you can replace this with responsive
design. If you&#039;re checking the browser name and version for feature support, see
if you can use feature detection instead.
It&#039;s always worth remembering that the user-agent, like any client provided
value, is not guaranteed to be accurate or even provided. The recent Log4j
vulnerability, &quot;Log4shell&quot;
provides an example of this risk. A client that sets its user-agent string to
include a value like ${jndi:ldap://example.com/file} may be able to get a site
to actively parse that on the server.
Caution
It&#039;s critical that you treat user-agent in the same way as any other form of
user input: sanitize and validate it before acting on the value.

# Cookie cataloguing
Another traditional new year activity is to make sure you&#039;re happy that you have
a healthy number of cookies with quality ingredients. As we continue moving
towards the phase out of third-party cookies, you should make sure you know
which of your site&#039;s cookies will be affected. 2020 provided a headstart as it
became necessary to mark all cookies for cross-site or third-party
use
with SameSite=None.
Any cookie where you have set the SameSite attribute to None will need an
update.
There are three possible routes to consider at the moment:

If the cookie is only required in a 1:1 relationship with the top-level site,
then follow the progress of the CHIPS
proposal. This will mean adding the
Partitioned attribute to the cookie.
If the cookie is used in a cross-site context, but only across sites that you
own and operate, then it may be a candidate for First-Party
Sets. This requires defining the
sites in the set and adding the SameParty attribute to the cookie.
If the cookie is used to provide some form of shared value across multiple
sites, investigate the wider set of Privacy Sandbox
proposals for an alternative solution that does not
rely on cross-site tracking.

If you&#039;re feeling especially health-conscious, then this is also an ideal time
to revisit all of your cookie usage, as we have a good recipe to improve your
first-party cookies too.

  

# Feedback
As we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the
Privacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the
information and support that they need. Let us know on @ChromiumDev
Twitter if there&#039;s anything that we could
improve in this series. We&#039;ll use your input to continue improving the format.
Check out the Privacy Sandbox FAQ, which we
continue to expand based on the issues you submit to the developer support
repo. If you
have any questions around testing or implementation on any of the proposals,
come talk to us there.</p>

    <p class="article__summary"># Introduction
Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public
websites as part of the
Private Network Access (PNA)
specification.
Chrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private
network request for a subresource, which asks
for explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will
carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the
response to it must carry a corresponding header,
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.
The aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
targeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have
affected hundreds of thousands of users,
allowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.
# Rollout plan
Chrome will roll this change out in two phases to give websites time to notice
the change and adjust accordingly.

In Chrome 98:

Chrome sends preflight requests ahead of private network subresource
requests.
Preflight failures only display warnings in DevTools, without otherwise
affecting the private network requests.
Chrome gathers compatibility data and reaches out to the largest
affected websites.
We expect this to be broadly compatible with existing websites.


In Chrome 101 at the earliest:

This will begin only if and when compatibility data indicates that the
change is safe enough and we&#039;ve outreached directly when necessary.
Chrome enforces that preflight requests must succeed, otherwise failing
the requests.
A deprecation trial starts at
the same time to allow for websites affected by this phase to request a
time extension. The trial will last for at least 6 months.



# What is Private Network Access (PNA)
Private Network Access
(formerly known as CORS-RFC1918)
restricts the ability of websites to send requests to servers on private
networks.
Chrome has already implemented part of the specification: as of Chrome 96, only
secure contexts are allowed to make private network requests. Refer to our
previous blog post for details.
The specification also extends the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
protocol so that websites must now explicitly request a grant from servers
on private networks before being allowed to send arbitrary requests.
Key Term
Private network requests are requests whose target server&#039;s IP address is
more private than that from which the request initiator was fetched. For example,
a request from a public website (https://example.com) to a private website
(http://router.local), or a request from a private website to localhost.



  
    Relationship between public, private, local networks in Private Network
    Access (CORS-RFC1918)
  

Learn more at Feedback wanted: CORS for private networks (RFC1918).
# Preflight requests
# Background
Preflight requests are a mechanism introduced by the Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS) standard used
to request permission from a target website before sending it an HTTP request
that might have side effects. This ensures that the target server understands
the CORS protocol and significantly reduces the risk of CSRF attacks.
The permission request is sent as an OPTIONS HTTP request with specific CORS
request headers
describing the upcoming HTTP request. The response must carry specific CORS
response headers
explicitly agreeing to the upcoming request.

# What&#039;s new in Private Network Access
A new pair of request and response headers is introduced to preflight requests:

Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true is set on all PNA preflight requests
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true must be set on all PNA preflight responses

Preflight requests for PNA are sent for all private network requests,
regardless of request method and
mode. They are sent
ahead of requests in cors mode as well as no-cors and all other modes. This
is because all private network requests can be used for CSRF attacks,
regardless of request mode and whether or not the response contents are made
available to the initiator.

If the private network request is made in cors mode, then CORS headers must
be set on the final response, in addition to the preflight response.

Preflight requests for PNA are also sent for same-origin requests, if the
target IP address is more private than the initiator. This is unlike regular
CORS, where preflight requests are only for cross-origin requests. Preflight
requests for same-origin requests guard against
DNS rebinding attacks.
# Examples
Observable behavior depends on the
request&#039;s mode.
# No-CORS mode
Say https://foo.example/index.html embeds
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bar.example/cat.gif&quot; alt=&quot;dancing cat&quot;/&gt;, and
bar.example resolves to 192.168.1.1, a private IP address according to
RFC 1918.
Chrome first sends a preflight request:
HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS /cat.gifOrigin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true
For this request to succeed, the server must respond with:
HTTP/1.1 204 No ContentAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true
Warning
The server can set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *, though this is dangerous
and discouraged. Private network resources should rarely be accessible to all
origins, so think carefully about the risks involved in setting such a header.

Then Chrome will send the actual request:
HTTP/1.1 GET /cat.gif...
To which the server can respond normally.
# CORS mode
Say https://foo.example/index.html runs the following code:
await fetch(&#039;https://bar.example/delete-everything&#039;, {  method: &#039;PUT&#039;,  credentials: &#039;include&#039;,})
Again, say bar.example  resolves to 192.168.1.1.
Chrome first sends a preflight request:
HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS /delete-everythingOrigin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Request-Method: PUTAccess-Control-Request-Credentials: trueAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true
For this request to succeed, the server must respond with:
HTTP/1.1 204 No ContentAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: PUTAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: trueAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true
Then Chrome will send the actual request:
HTTP/1.1 PUT /delete-everythingOrigin: https://foo.example
To which the server can respond per usual CORS rules:
HTTP/1.1 200 OKAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example
# How to know if your website is affected
Starting in Chrome 98, if a private network request is detected, a preflight
request will be sent ahead of it. If this preflight request fails, the final
request will still be sent, but a warning will be surfaced in the DevTools
issues panel.

Affected preflight requests can also be viewed and diagnosed in the network panel:

To review what happens if preflight success was enforced, you can
pass the following command-line argument,
starting in Chrome 98:
--enable-features=PrivateNetworkAccessRespectPreflightResults
Any failed preflight request will result in a failed fetch. This can allow you
to test whether your website would work after the
second phase of our rollout plan. Errors can be diagnosed in
the same way as warnings using the DevTools panels mentioned above.
# What to do if your website is affected
When this change rolls out in Chrome 98, it is not expected to break any
website. However, we strongly encourage you to update affected request paths to
ensure your website keeps running as expected.
There are two solutions available to you:

Handle preflight requests on the server side
Disable PNA checks with enterprise policies

# Handle preflight requests server-side
Update the target server of any affected fetches to handle PNA preflight
requests. First, implement support for standard CORS preflight requests on
affected routes. Then add support for the two new response headers.
When your server receives a preflight request (an OPTIONS request with CORS
headers), the server should check for the presence of an
Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true header. If this header is
present on the request, the server should examine the Origin header and the
request path along with any other relevant information (such as
Access-Control-Request-Headers) to ensure the request is safe to allow.
Typically, you should allow access to a single origin under your control.
Warning
Beware of insecure (non-https) origins, as they are unauthenticated. An on-path
attacker could masquerade as any such origin!

Once your server has decided to allow the request, it should respond
204 No Content (or 200 OK) with the necessary CORS headers and the new PNA
header. These headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin and
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true, as well as others as needed.
Refer to the examples for concrete scenarios.
# Disable Private Network Access checks using enterprise policies
If you have administrative control over your users, you can disable Private
Network Access checks using either of the following policies:

InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed
InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls

For more information, refer to Understand Chrome policy
management.
# What&#039;s next
Next up, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover
web workers:
dedicated workers, shared workers and service workers. We&#039;re tentatively aiming
for Chrome 100 to begin showing warnings.
Then, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover navigations,
including iframes and popups. We&#039;re tentatively aiming for Chrome 102 to start
showing warnings.
In both cases, we will be proceeding cautiously with a similar phased rollout,
in order to give web developers time to adjust and estimate compatibility risk.

    <p class="article__summary">Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite
gradient flavors.
In Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an
evolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by
adding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse
for crisp and compact font files that compress well.

Examples in this blog post require a browser that supports
COLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.

# Color now
On the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does
not define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be
placed. That&#039;s usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a
color. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that together have
meaning. For example, this flag  with light blue, pink, and white stripes would not
convey the same meaning if it was simply drawn in the current text color.
Today, for most users, emojis are the only color fonts they see. Emojis
typically appear on the web via the system emoji font, or by inserting images
(which has its own complications, ). Large file
sizes especially for bitmap-based color fonts have made it difficult to use web
fonts for emoji. By supporting COLRv1, we hope to see a proliferation of
creative color font use on the web and beyond.
# Show me your colors
We&#039;ve created a couple of examples for you to play with:
 

 

 

The example assets from Google Fonts used in the example are live in the
Google Fonts web API. They are
not listed in the directory at fonts.google.com as
they will only work on Chrome 98 or later and showcase experimental work.
You can now make your own COLRv1 fonts using free and open-source tools. Check

# New with COLRv1
The font format supports multiple ways to support color, all with different
tradeoffs – but none have been successful on the web so far. (To learn more
about the tradeoffs,
take a look at Dominik&#039;s BlinkOn 15 conference talk.)
Chrome 98 brings support for COLRv1, an evolution of COLRv0. We hope that
COLRv1&#039;s combination of graphic capabilities and compact files will make it a
good choice for many color font use cases. COLRv1 adds gradients,
compositing, and blending, and improves
internal shape reuse to make even more compact files.
COLRv1 has expressive capability roughly equivalent to
SVG Native plus
blending and compositing added on
top. There are four types of color fills: solid colors, linear gradients, radial
gradients, and sweep/conic gradients. COLRv1 lets you reposition and transform
glyph elements using a full set of translate, rotate, sheer, and scale
transformations. Plus, it features support for font variations and reuses
existing shape definition formats in the font.
  Shape reuse in the crystal ball
    emoji 
Think about the crystal ball emoji as an example: The star-shaped highlights are
the same shape but different sizes, which means just one shape can be
repositioned and reused without duplication inside the file. The format allows
you to reuse a full glyph within a new glyph, without having to redundantly
encode the same shapes for each glyph. Imagine a decorative color font with
floral decorations, where the same flower shapes are placed on different letters
by just referencing existing color glyphs. For the web font use case, COLRv1
compresses well under woff2. For example, a test build of Twemoji using COLRv1
takes about 1.2 MB inflated, but is about 0.6MB in woff2 form. A build of the
full Noto Emoji Glyph set is reduced from 9MB for the bitmap version to 1.85MB
in COLRv1+woff2 form.

# No more image replacement: emoji fonts
If you support user generated content, your users probably use emojis. Today
it&#039;s very common to scan text and replace any emoji encountered with images to
ensure consistent cross-platform rendering and the ability to support newer
emojis than the OS supports. Those images then have to be switched back to text
during clipboard operations. Here&#039;s a real example:


Image replacement in Google Chat

If you have an emoji font you just render the text in the font, like this:
&lt;style&gt;@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Color+Emoji);.emoji {  font-family: &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;, sans-serif;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;emoji&quot;&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;
Similarly, in an emoji reaction component, COLRv1 offers the opportunity to use
a compact font file instead of a catalog of image assets.

# Artistic expression
Space-efficient color fonts enable new forms of artistic expression in text on
the web. This example of a Kufi-style Arabic font uses color gradients as an
artistic interpretation of what the ink flow of traditional calligraphy could
look like when applied to the Kufi style of Arabic writing, which originates
from not being written with nib and ink but carved in stone.

# Feature detection
At the moment, figuring out whether a browser engine supports a specific color
font format is possible by means of user-agent sniffing or by searching in a
library like ChromaCheck by
@PixelAmbacht to test rendering of color
glyphs on Canvas. Both solutions are not optimal. Feature testing should detect
only a specific feature itself and avoid user agent sniffing. The ChromaCheck
library should not need to perform resource-intensive 2D canvas operations for
determining support.
The Chrome team wants to improve that and has started a series of discussions
[1,
2] in the CSS working group
to provide information on browser font technology support in JavaScript and
declaratively in CSS. The team plans to release efficient feature detection for
color font and other font technologies in a future version of Chrome.
If you would like to use color fonts in your project right now when COLRv1
support is limited to Chrome, there are two ways you can do that: Ask your font
vendor for a COLRv1 font that contains monochrome glyphs too. User agents that
don’t support COLRv1 will fall back to rendering monochrome
glyphs. Alternatively, you can use the ChromaCheck library or user agent
sniffing to determine whether COLRv1 support is available. Then you deliver CSS
that loads COLRv1 fonts in supporting user agents and use an alternative font
format such as COLRv0, a bitmap font format or OpenType SVG in other browsers.
# CSS font-palette support
It would be tremendously useful if using a different set of colors would not
require a new font. Thankfully, a mechanism exists: the
font-palette CSS property. The
Chrome team is working on adding
support for font-palette in Chrome.
# COLRv1 fonts &amp; you
If COLRv1 fonts piques your interest, ask your font vendor about a COLRv1 color
font to use in your project, try the examples and demos
above, or why not dive right in and experiment with
making your own?
If you have feedback on COLRv1 in Chrome, post to the
blink-dev mailing list,
or file an issue in our issue tracker. If you have feedback
on the COLRv1 font format itself, file an issue at the
COLRv1 specification GitHub repository.
With Chrome 98, we’re excited about how COLRv1 brings a whole new level of
typographic creativity to the web.

Here&#039;s what you need to know:

WebTransport is a new option for sending real time messages
between the client and server.
You can use feature detection to see what
types of scripts a browser supports.
Searching arrays from the end becomes a little
easier.
And there&#039;s plenty more.

Happy New Year! I&#039;m Pete LePage. Let&#039;s dive in and
see what&#039;s new for developers in Chrome 97.
# Web Transport
If you&#039;re using Web Sockets or the WebRTC Data Channel API to send messages
between your server and the page, there&#039;s a new option for you. WebTransport
is a new API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging.
It has lower latency than WebSockets, and unlike the RTC Data Channel API,
which is designed for peer-to-peer messaging, the Web Transport API is
specifically designed for client-server messaging.
It supports sending data, reliably with its streams APIs, and unreliably with
its datagram APIs. It&#039;s supported in web workers. And because it exposes a
Streams compliant interface, it supports optimizations around backpressure.
To use it, you&#039;ll need a server that supports HTTP/3, which is generally
easier than setting up and maintaining a WebRTC server. Open a new
WebTransport instance, wait for it to connect, and you can start sending
data.
const url = &#039;https://example.com:4999/foo/bar&#039;;const transport = new WebTransport(url);await transport.ready;const writer = transport.datagrams.writable.getWriter();const data1 = new Uint8Array([65, 66, 67]);writer.write(data1);
Check out the article Experimenting with WebTransport on
web.dev for complete details.
# Script type feature detection
Today, we can use the nomodule attribute to detect support
for JavaScript modules in the browser. But there are several new feature
proposals in the pipeline, like import maps, speculation rules, and bundle
preloading. We need a way to know what a browser supports.
Enter HTMLScriptElement.supports(). You can use it to
determine what types of scripts you can use, and send the browser the best
option.
if (HTMLScriptElement.supports(&#039;importmap&#039;)) {  // Use &lt;script type=&quot;importmap&quot; ...&gt;} else if (HTMLScriptElement.supports(&#039;module&#039;)) {  // Use &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; ...&gt;} else {  // Use classic method...}
# New array prototypes
I love it when JavaScript gets easier. Array and TypedArray now support
the findLast() and findLastIndex() static methods.
These functions are effectively the same as find() and
findIndex(), but search from the end of an array
instead of the beginning.
For example, to find the last number in an array that is larger than ten,
call findLast() with a test function that checks if the value is greater
than ten, and you&#039;re good to go.
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44, 3, 6];function greaterThanTen(val) {  return val &gt; 10;}const last = array1.findLast(greaterThanTen);// 44const lIdx = array1.findLastIndex(greaterThanTen);// 4
# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string
In just a few months, we&#039;ll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number.
Any code that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be
checked to make sure it handles three digits.
There&#039;s a flag called #force-major-version-to-100 that
will change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure
everything works as expected.

# And more!
Of course there&#039;s plenty more.
New lines in form entries are now normalized in the same
way as Gecko and WebKit, improving interoperability between browsers.
We&#039;re standardizing client hint names by prefixing them with sec-ch.
For example, dpr becomes sec-ch-dpr. We&#039;ll continue to support existing
versions of these hints, but you should plan for their eventual deprecation
and removal.
Closed &lt;details&gt; elements are now searchable and can be
linked to. These hidden elements will automatically expand when find in page,
ScrollToTextFragment, and element fragment navigation are used.

Chrome DevTools is launching a full accessibility tree making it easier for developers to get an overview of the whole tree. In this post find out how this tree is created and how to use it in your work.
          
# What is the accessibility tree?
Assistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.
In Chrome DevTools, we provide the accessibility pane to help developers understand how their content is exposed to assistive technology. Concretely, when a node is selected in the DOM tree viewer, the properties of the corresponding accessibility node displays in the pane together with a view of the node&#039;s ancestors and its immediate children.

# How is the tree created?
Before we get to what this new full tree view looks like in DevTools, let us briefly go over what the accessibility tree is in more tangible terms. The accessibility tree is a derivative of the DOM tree. Its structure is roughly the same, but simplified to remove nodes with no semantic content such as a &lt;div&gt; element purely used for styling. Each node in the tree has a role such as Button or Heading, and often a name that can be either from ARIA attributes or derived from the node’s contents. If we look at an HTML document:
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;  &lt;title&gt;How old are you?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;  &lt;label for=&quot;age&quot;&gt;Age&lt;/label&gt;  &lt;input id=&quot;age&quot; type=&quot;number&quot; name=&quot;age&quot; value=&quot;42&quot;&gt;  &lt;div&gt;    &lt;button&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;button&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
The renderer in Chromium, named Blink, derives an internal accessibility tree roughly as follows.
role=&#039;rootWebArea&#039; focusable name=&#039;How old are you?&#039;  role=&#039;genericContainer&#039; ignored    role=&#039;genericContainer&#039; ignored      role=&#039;labelText&#039;        role=&#039;staticText&#039; name=&#039;Age&#039;      role=&#039;spinButton&#039; editable focusable name=&#039;Age&#039; value=&#039;42&#039;        role=&#039;genericContainer&#039; editable          role=&#039;staticText&#039; editable name=&#039;42&#039;      role=&#039;genericContainer&#039;        role=&#039;button&#039; focusable name=&#039;Back&#039;          role=&#039;staticText&#039; name=&#039;Back&#039;        role=&#039;button&#039; focusable name=&#039;Next&#039;          role=&#039;staticText&#039; name=&#039;Next&#039;
Note that this representation contains multiple superfluous nodes with role genericContainer, which seemingly contradicts the statement above that the accessibility tree is a simplified derivative of the DOM tree. Still, most of these nodes only occur in the internal tree and would not be exposed to assistive technology. Since DevTools collects its accessibility information directly from the renderer process, this is the tree representation that DevTools handles.

The HTML example was borrowed from here which also contains more information about how accessibility works in Chromium.

# Full accessibility tree in DevTools
The new, full accessibility tree synchronized with the DOM tree so developers can switch back and forth between the two trees. We hope that the new tree will prove more explorable, useful, and easier to use.
Now that you know how the accessibility tree works, you can use DevTools to see how the new tree view looks. The following HTML document with a title, heading, and two buttons is used to show the tree.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Heading for example page&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;button&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;button&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The previous tree view would only enable you to explore a single node and its ancestors.

Now, when you toggle the new tree, it replaces the DOM tree view and allows you to see the full accessibility tree for the page:

# Lazy tree construction
To make the tree performant even for larger sites, the tree is lazily constructed on the frontend as it is explored. Once a node is expanded in the tree, the children for the nodes are fetched through Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and the tree is rebuilt.

# Live
The new tree view is live and dynamically updates if the accessibility tree changes in the renderer. It hooks into the same mechanics that would notify assistive technology of changes to the tree, and uses that to emit events to the DevTools frontend with updated nodes.
In practice, the CDP backend listens for updates to the tree, keeps track of which nodes have been requested before, and sends events to the DevTools frontend if any of these nodes changes.
          
# The tale of many trees
In the description of what the accessibility tree is you learned how Blink constructs an accessibility tree for the DOM it is rendering, and DevTools fetches this tree through CDP. While this is true, we left out some complications in this description. In reality, there are quite a lot of different ways to experience the accessibility tree in Chromium.
When designing the new tree view for DevTools, we have made some choices along the way about what part of Chromium’s accessibility internals we wanted to surface.
# Platforms
Every platform has a different accessibility API and while the shape of the tree is the same across all platforms, the API for interacting with the tree is different, and the names of attributes can differ. DevTools shows Chromium’s internal tree where roles and attributes tend to match those defined in the ARIA specification.
# Multiple frames and site isolation
Since Chromium not only puts the content of every tab in different renderer processes but also isolates cross-site documents in different renderer processes, we have to connect to each out-of-process child document separately over CDP and fetch its accessibility tree. We then stitch these subtrees together on the frontend to give the illusion of one coherent tree, although they live in different renderer processes in Chromium.
# Ignored and uninteresting nodes
We hide some nodes per default: ignored nodes, and nodes with role “generic” with no name. These nodes carry no semantic meaning and, in the case of ignored nodes, are not exposed to assistive technology. We hide these nodes to avoid cluttering the tree view. If we did not, the accessibility tree for most web pages would instead look something like this:

The caveat here is that this essentially means that we need to construct yet another tree than what is available on the backend. Say, for example, that we have nodes A, B, C, and X where A has child X and B, and X has child C. If X is an ignored node, we prune X from the tree and instead create a tree where C is a child to A.

On the frontend, we construct the full tree including ignored nodes and only prune them just before rendering the nodes. We do this for two reasons:

It makes it much simpler to handle node updates from the backend, since we have the same tree structure on both endpoints. For example, if the node B is removed in the example, we would receive an update for node X (since its children have changed), but if we had pruned that node we would struggle to figure out what to update.
It ensures that all DOM nodes have a corresponding accessibility node. When the tree is toggled, we select the node corresponding to the node currently selected in the DOM tree. So for the previous example, if the user toggles the tree while the DOM node corresponding to X is selected, we inject X between the nodes A and B and select X in the tree. This allows the user to inspect the accessibility node for all DOM nodes and help determine why the node is ignored.

# Future ideas
Launching the new accessibility tree is just the start. We have a few ideas for future projects we could build on top of the new view, but we are also eager to hear your feedback!
# Alternative filterings
As explained above, we currently filter out nodes that are deemed uninteresting. We could provide a way to disable this behavior and show all nodes, or provide alternative filterings such as Show landmark nodes or Show headings.
# Highlight a11y issues
We could incorporate an “accessibility best practice” analysis with the tree and highlight accessibility issues directly on the offending nodes.
# Surface accessibility actions in DevTools
The tree we currently show is purely one-way: It allows us to get an idea of what information would be fed to assistive technology when browsing a specific webpage. Accessibility actions represent the communication in the other direction: They allow assistive technology to act on the presented UI. We could surface such actions in DevTools to allow actions such as “clicking”, scrolling, or changing values on the page using the API available to assistive technology.</p>

    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z">2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Welcome to the November edition of &quot;Progress in the Privacy
Sandbox,&quot; tracking the milestones on
the path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more
private web. Each month we&#039;ll share an overview of the updates to the Privacy
Sandbox timeline along with news from
across the project. We&#039;ve also provided an update on our Privacy Sandbox
commitments
as we ensure proposals are designed, developed and implemented with regulatory
oversight and input from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and
Information Commissioner&#039;s Office (ICO).

As we approach the end of the year there are fewer changes across the different
proposals, so the update here is also lighter. However, this does mean it&#039;s a
good time for testing and addressing questions, which we are always happy to
hear about either on the @ChromiumDev Twitter
or the developer support
repo.

# Events
At the beginning of November we hosted the Chrome Developer Summit, which
included both a Privacy Sandbox segment in the keynote and a few related
questions in the Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. We&#039;ve added a summary for
you to read or watch that covers
activities and examples of what to expect as proposals progress through the
discussion, testing, and scaled adoption phases.

  

# Strengthen cross-site privacy boundaries
Third-party cookies are a key mechanism that enables cross-site tracking.
Phasing them out is a major milestone, but we also need to tackle other forms of
cross-site storage or communication.
# Federated Credentials Management API
Federated Credentials Management (FedCM) is
the new, more meaningful name for the WebID proposal.  We&#039;ve reflected this
change in the Privacy Sandbox Timeline.
Federated identity is a critical service for the web, but given that it&#039;s
explicitly used to share aspects of identity across other sites, there are
implementation details which overlap with cross-site tracking.
The Federated Credentials Management proposal explores a range of options: from
simple migration paths for existing solutions to more private methods of
connecting to services with the bare minimum of information shared.
November also included the bi-annual
BlinkOn conference. Blink is
the rendering engine used by Chromium, and BlinkOn is where contributors gather
for engineering presentations and discussions on current projects. The November
BlinkOn included an overview and Q&amp;A session on FedCM: you can watch the
recording on YouTube.
# Preventing covert tracking
As we reduce the options for explicit cross-site tracking, we also need to
address the areas of the web platform that expose identifying information which
enables fingerprinting or covert tracking of users.
# User-Agent string reduction and User-Agent Client Hints
Progress continues on reducing the information available by default in Chrome&#039;s
User-Agent string and providing an improved, active method for requesting that
data via User-Agent Client Hints. We&#039;ve added a new User-Agent
Reduction overview to collate all the
current guidance and updates.
We published new testing resources to help prepare for the changes. The
User-Agent reduction code
snippets provide a selection of
examples for transforming the current Chrome User-Agent string to the reduced
format. There is also the new chrome://flags/#force-major-version-to-100 entry
which will let you check if the switch to a 3 digit major version causes your
site to malfunction or break.
We have published the Intent to Ship for
Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List.
This addresses ecosystem
feedback that the existing
Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version was too tightly bound to the primary browser brand as it
only provided a single value. For example, the current implementation shows:
⬇️ Server response header
Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version
⬆️ Browser request header
Sec-CH-UA: &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;;Not A Brand&quot;;v=&quot;99&quot;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version: &quot;94.0.4606.124&quot;
The updated version would provide:
⬇️ Server response header
Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List
⬆️ Browser request header
Sec-CH-UA: &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;Other browser&quot;;v=&quot;99&quot;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List: &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;94.0.4606.124&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;94.0.4606.124&quot;, &quot;Other browser&quot;;v=&quot;99.88.77.66&quot;

If you are using Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version then you should plan to migrate to
Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List as it will allow us to deprecate
Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version in the future.

# IP blindness
IP addresses by their nature often provide a unique identifier for a client
enabling the necessary communication between browser and server. However, this
also means that a stable IP address over time passively provides a significant
amount of information that can be used for cross-site tracking.
The IP blindness proposal (also
known as Global Network Address Translation Combined with Audited and Trusted
CDN or HTTP-Proxy Eliminating Reidentification or Gnatcatcher) details a two
pronged approach to addressing this issue. The first is Near-Path
NAT
which effectively forwards the browser&#039;s connection through an IP privatizing
service which hides the browser&#039;s IP address from the site being visited. The
second option builds on the layered nature of the Internet where the
infrastructure that relies on IP address can be wholly separate from the
application running on top of it. The Willful IP
Blindness
proposal explores methods of defining auditable policies for creating and
maintaining that separation.
Both of these ideas are early in the discussion phase with active progress in
the repo, such as the recently posted Willful IP Blindness
Principles.
You can expect to see discussion continue there and if you&#039;re interested in the
network-level details, you can follow the Multiplexed Application Substrate

# Measure digital ads
As the companion to displaying ads without cross-site tracking, we need
privacy-preserving mechanisms to allow measurement of ad effectiveness.
# Attribution Reporting API
The Attribution Reporting
API creates functionality to
measure events on one site, like clicking or viewing an ad, that lead to a
conversion on another site—without enabling cross-site tracking.
We continue to test the API and the origin trial has been
extended
through to Chrome 97. Current origin trial tokens expired on October 12th, so
existing testers need to apply for updated tokens to continue testing.
There are two new blog posts up with the latest details on event-level reporting
in the API. Event-level reports in the Attribution Reporting
API
introduces the concepts and process while Using event-level reports in the
Attribution Reporting
API goes into the
implementation detail with accompanying demo and demo code.
# Feedback
As we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the
Privacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the
information and support that they need. Let us know on @ChromiumDev
Twitter if there&#039;s anything that we could
improve in this series. We&#039;ll use your input to continue improving the format.
Check out the Privacy Sandbox FAQ, which we
continue to expand based on the issues you submit to the developer support
repo. If you
have any questions around testing or implementation on any of the proposals,
come talk to us there.</p>

# Preview feature: New Recorder panel
Use the new Recorder panel to record, replay and measure user flows.
Open the Recorder panel. Follow the instructions on screen to start a new recording.
For example, you can record the coffee checkout process with this coffee ordering demo application. After adding a coffee and filling out payment details, you can end the recording, replay the process or click on the Measure performance button to measure the user flow in the Performance panel.
Go to the Recorder panel documentation to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial!
The Recorder panel is a preview feature. Our team is still actively working on it and we are looking for your feedback for further enhancements.

Chromium issue: 1257499
# Refresh device list in Device Mode
Enabling the Device Toolbar, more modern devices are now added in the device list. Select a device to simulate its dimensions.

Chromium issue: 1223525
# Autocomplete with Edit as HTML
The Edit as HTML UI now supports autocomplete and syntax highlights. In the Elements panel, right click on an element, and select  Edit as HTML. Try typing a DOM property (e.g. id, aria), the autocomplete should help you find the property name you&#039;re looking for.

Chromium issue: 1215072
# Improved code debugging experience
Column numbers are now included in the output error in the Console. Having easy access to the column number is essential for debugging especially with minified JavaScript.

Chromium issue: 1073064
# [Experimental] Syncing DevTools settings across devices
Your DevTools settings are now synced across devices by default when you turn on Chrome profile sync. You can change the DevTools sync settings via Settings &gt; Sync &gt; Enable settings sync.

This new setting makes it easier for you to work across devices. For example, the following appearance settings are synced so you have a consistent experience across devices and don’t need to re-define the same settings again. Learn more about the sync feature in DevTools customization.

This feature is experimental at the moment, the team is still actively working on it. If you have any feedback, please share with us here.

    <p class="article__summary"># Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop
laid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of
installed web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in
PWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching
existing features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews
to gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article
covers how we got there.
# Unified install language
The call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across
the web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to
home screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we
emphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from
a study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The
team found that Add to home screen worked better, if only
marginally, on mobile.
A further study on taxonomy in 2019 found no difference, and so the
team wanting to unify the PWA install experience, decided to update
the label to Install on Android. A further study in 2021 compared
the language, Install, Get, and Download, and we found
that users understood Install as the process that was happening.
Users felt tapping a button with the label Get would send the user
to a website, and with Download they assumed a file would end up
in their downloads folder or equivalent.
With all this in mind, we concluded that the label Install best
fits PWAs. We recommend developers across the web platform adopt
Install as the preferred string going forward.
# Install icon on desktop
On our desktop platforms, we have a design pattern that whenever a website
loads a PWA, Chrome will show a pill that appears on the right-hand side of the
omnibox that contains an icon and the label Install. After
that, when a user visits a site, only the icon will be present.
Clicking on this pill triggers the installation of a desktop
PWA.



Original install plus icon.


The icon was initially a plus symbol, partly due to the Add to home
screen metaphor used on mobile. However, as mentioned, the language
we used was Install. The feedback we received from the developer
community was that this icon was confusing. Furthermore, if a user
used the zoom function to enlarge text, the icon for zoom looked very
similar, confusing the user even more.



Omnibox bug with zoom and install icons present.


I decided to investigate our user&#039;s perception, as most feedback was
anecdotal. Working with our UX researchers, we ran a study with
10,000 users in the USA and Indonesia to determine users&#039;
understanding of install iconography. We tested five different
designs, including the existing one, and asked users what &quot;Install&quot;
meant. We discovered that the current icon, the plus symbol, was the
most confusing to our users. Many confused the symbol
with &quot;medicine&quot;, &quot;first aid&quot; and &quot;batteries&quot;.
We also found that users primarily associated imagery such as arrows
and devices with the install. Based on these conclusions, we ran an
A/B/C test in Chrome, comparing the existing design with two
alternatives. We landed on the arrow pointing down into a monitor,
which performed significantly better than the other two. We also saw
a decrease in dismissals of the install UI with this new icon.



Variants of our install iconography that you can download from our 
Material Design icon set.


The outcome is the design you see today, which has seen the install
rate for PWAs more than double for websites. We have also added this
icon and a mobile equivalent to our Material Design icon set,
enabling the community to use the iconography that we found most
engaging.
Of course, a single icon will not change the world, which leads us to
our next feature.
# In-product help 
In-Product Help is a blue bubble tooltip that onboards users on new
features that may interest them based on specific criteria. We
decided to launch this design pattern to inform users about the
install features and further support the new icon redesign.



In-product help tooltip bubble that educates users about features.


When a user visits a website regularly, Chrome uses a service known
as Site Engagement.
This provides information about how engaged a user is with a site. By
visiting chrome://site-engagement/, you can see the sites that you
are engaging with regularly. Using these scores, we could determine
if a user is interested in a website. If the site was a PWA and the
user was engaged we would show them the install In-Product Help UI.
This meant that we only focused on engaged users and not annoy users
who may visit a site one time.
By using in-product help on desktop, we saw a greater than 100%
increase in PWA installation, showing that focusing on engaged users
improved the installability of web apps.
# Richer Install UI
The install paradigm for most users is a store.
Since the mid-2000&#039;s we have educated users that whenever they are
installing an app, they will see a description, screenshots, and
other metadata to help them decide if an app is something they
want.
With PWAs, the UI we showed once a user had decided to install a web
app was relatively meager. So the team decided to explore a richer
install experience that would give context to our users about the web
app and enable developers to celebrate the PWA&#039;s that were on par
with native experiences.



Richer Install UI, collapsed and expanded states.


Earlier this year, we launched Richer Install,
an extended install UI on Chrome on Android that allows developers to
add screenshots to their manifest. Developers can also add a
description, which is recommended but not necessary. Due to this
newer UI, we saw an install rate for some PWAs double, showing that
users have greater confidence in installing web apps when we give
more context and richer experiences.. The desktop version of this UI
is currently a work in progress.
# Conclusion
The team has spent the last two years exploring and
experimenting with newer features in Chrome that have enabled and
empowered PWA developers and helped to educate users about the
benefits of web experiences. There is still plenty of work we can
do, but collectively we can improve and enrich our users&#039; lives
and further support the open web.</p>

Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.

Chrome 97 beta was released on November 18, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late December, 2021.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. The SDES specification has been declared
historic by the IETF. Its usage in Chrome has declined significantly over the
recent year. Consequently it is
removed as of Chrome
97.
# Remove WebSQL in third-party contexts
WebSQL in third-party contexts is now removed.
The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in
November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated it in
2019. The W3C encourages
Web Storage
and
Indexed Database
for those needing alternatives.
# Remove SDP Plan B
The Session Description Protocol (SDP) used to establish a session in WebRTC has
been implemented with two different dialects in Chromium: Unified Plan and Plan
B. Plan B is not cross-browser compatible and is hereby
removed.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:

They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.

Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#039;s,
essentially:

Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.

You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

Here&#039;s what you need to know:

The manifest id property lets you specify a unique ID for
your PWA.
The protocol_handlers property allows you to
automatically register your PWA as a protocol handler upon installation.
The priority hints origin trial allows you to specify
priority hints for downloading resources.
You can force the Chrome version to 100 to test how your code
will react to a three digit version number.
Videos from the Chrome Dev Summit are all online.
And there&#039;s plenty more.

I&#039;m Pete LePage, finally shooting
in the studio, let&#039;s dive in and see what&#039;s new for developers in Chrome 96.
# Manifest id for PWAs
When a user installs a PWA, the browser needs a way to uniquely identify it.
But, until recently, the web app manifest spec didn&#039;t specify how to identify
a PWA, leaving browsers to decide, and leading to different implementations.
In some browsers, the start_url is used, while in others, the path to the
manifest file is used.
That makes it impossible to change either of those fields without breaking the
install experience. Now, there&#039;s a new optional id property, that allows
you to explicitly define the identifier used for your PWA.
Adding the id property to the manifest removes the dependency on the
start_url or the location of the manifest, and makes it possible for those
fields to be updated.
{  ...  id: &quot;/?homescreen=1&quot;,  start_url: &quot;/?homescreen=1&quot;,  ...}
Support for the id property lands in desktop Chromium-based browsers
starting in Chrome 96. Support for mobile, which currently uses the manifest
url as the unique ID, should land in the first half of 2022.

If you already have a PWA in production and want to add an id to your
manifest, you&#039;ll need to use the ID that was assigned by the browser. You can
find the id in the Manifest pane of the Application panel in Dev Tools.

For a brand new PWA, you can set the id to any string value you like, but
remember, you won&#039;t be able to change it in the future, so choose wisely.
{  ...  id: &quot;SquooshApp&quot;,  start_url: &quot;/?homescreen=1&quot;,  ...}
Check out Uniquely identifying PWAs with the web app manifest id property
for more info.
# URL protocol handlers for PWAs
Web apps can use navigator.registerProtocolHandler() to
register as a protocol handler. For example, Gmail can register the mailto
protocol. Then when a user clicks on a link with the mailto: prefix, Gmail
will open, making it easy for the user to send an email.
Starting in Chrome 96, a PWA can register as a protocol handler as part of its
installation. To do that for your PWA, add a protocol_handlers property to
your web app manifest, specify the protocol you want to handle, and the
url that should be opened when clicked.
  ...  &quot;protocol_handlers&quot;: [    {      &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;web+tea&quot;,      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;/tea?type=%s&quot;    },    {      &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;web+coffee&quot;,      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;/coffee?type=%s&quot;    }  ]}
There are some restrictions here, and you can&#039;t just register any protocol, so
check out URL protocol handler registration for PWAs for complete
details, and how you can use the web+ syntax to create your own protocols!
# Priority hints (origin trial)
When a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources
such as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority to try to
optimize the page load. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities, but
may not be optimal in all cases.
Priority Hints are an experimental feature, available as an
origin trial starting in Chrome 96, and can help optimize the Core
Web Vitals. The importance attribute allows you to specify the priority
for resource types such as CSS, fonts, scripts, images, and iframes.
&lt;!-- We don&#039;t want a high priority for this above-the-fold image --&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/not-important.svg&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Initiate an early fetch for a resource, but de-prioritize it --&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;/script.js&quot; as=&quot;script&quot; importance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;  fetch(&#039;https://example.com/&#039;, {importance: &#039;high&#039;})      .then(data =&gt; {        // Trigger a high priority fetch      });&lt;/script&gt;
For example, here&#039;s the Google Flights page. That background image is the
largest contentful paint (LCP).

Let&#039;s see it loaded with, and without priority hints. With the priority set
to high on the background image, the LCP drops from 2.6 seconds to 1.9
seconds.
          
Check out Optimizing resource loading with Priority Hints for
all the details, how to register for the origin trial, and some great examples
of how it can help to improve your rendering performance.
# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string
Early next year, we&#039;ll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number. Any
code that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be checked
to make sure it handles three digits.
Starting in Chrome 96, there&#039;s a new flag #force-major-version-to-100 that
will change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure
everything works as expected.

For details see Force Chrome major version to 100 in the User-Agent string.
# Chrome Dev Summit
Chrome Dev Summit is a wrap. All of the videos and content are available
online. Check out the Chrome Dev Summit site, or if you missed
the keynote or livestream, check out the CDS Playlist on the
Chrome Developers YouTube Channel.
# And more!
Of course there&#039;s plenty more.

The Back, forward cache – or bfcache – is now available in stable, and
brings Chrome in line with both Firefox and Safari.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2021-11-15T00:00:00.000Z">2021-11-15T00:00:00.000Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Lighthouse is a website auditing tool that helps developers with opportunities and diagnostics to improve the user experience of their sites.
Lighthouse 9.0 is available immediately on the command line, in Chrome Canary, and in PageSpeed Insights. It will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 98.
# API changes
Most users should not run into any workflow-breaking changes with this release. If you run custom Lighthouse audits or use tools that depend on details deep in the Lighthouse report JSON, there may be some breaking changes in 9.0 that you need to be aware of.
See the full list of changes in the 9.0 changelog.
# Lighthouse for user flows
Lighthouse has a new user-flow API that allows lab testing at any point within a page&#039;s lifespan.
Puppeteer is used to script page loads and trigger synthetic user interactions, and Lighthouse can be invoked in multiple ways to capture key insights during those interactions. This means that performance can be measured during page load and during interactions with the page.

For more information, see the Lighthouse user flows tutorial and code samples.
# Report refresh
The Lighthouse report has been refreshed to improve readability and make the source of the report and how it was run clearer.
A final screenshot has been embedded at the top of the report to make it obvious at a glance if the page being tested loaded correctly and is in the format expected.

The summary information at the bottom of the report has also been redesigned to better communicate how Lighthouse was run and the report collected.

To see the new report in action, try out Lighthouse 9.0 or visit this example report.
# Related accessibility elements
A common accessibility problem is when things that are supposed to be unique in a page are not, for instance if the id referenced in a aria-labelledby attribute is used on multiple elements.
Lighthouse has always warned about this situation, but would only list the first instance of an element with a repeated ID, which often caused confusion because some users would assume it was showing all elements causing an issue. Since Lighthouse was only showing a single element, they&#039;d assume it was a bug that the single element was being flagged as a duplicate.
In Lighthouse 9.0, all the elements sharing that ID are now listed:

This &quot;related nodes&quot; functionality is provided by axe-core, so it may appear in other accessibility audits as well.
For more information, see the issue collecting user reports and the implementation pull request.
# Running Lighthouse
Lighthouse is available in Chrome DevTools, npm (as a Node module and a CLI), and as a browser extension (in Chrome and Firefox). It powers many Google services, including web.dev/measure and PageSpeed Insights.
To try the Lighthouse Node CLI, use the following commands:
npm install -g lighthouselighthouse https://www.example.com --view
# Get in touch with the Lighthouse team

I need your help to create a user-friendly web app for note-taking!
Notes, notebooks, stickies—physical or digital—have become a big part of our professional and personal lives.
Whether we’re using Apple’s built-in Notes app, a physical notebook or deck of index cards, or something more involved like Notion or Roam, most of us have tools that we use to make notes—ephemeral or permanent—to help us organise our lives.
I’m Baldur Bjarnason. I’ve been working in web development, digital publishing, and digital reading for over twenty years. I’m working on a prototype for a note-taking web app called Colophon Cards1.
(You can follow my progress on the project over at the Colophon Cards website.)
My Colophon Cards project is an effort to build a note-taking tool that stakes out the otherwise sparsely populated middle ground in the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) space:

As straightforward to use as is sensible
A bit more visually oriented than the high-end apps
Have the hypertextual or organisational features from the high-end that don’t make the app too complicated to use
Have at least basic support for our digital reading needs

To accomplish this, I need your help!
I need to know what you are doing—how you take notes.
Ideally, I would also need to know how some of my in-progress ideas and designs work for you.
The first step towards this is a short survey you can take to help me see the lay of the note-taking land. It should only take you about five minutes to finish. More importantly, it ends with a question where you can volunteer to be a tester for the project.
Which I would find very helpful 🙂.
Feel free to share a link to this post or the survey with anybody you think might be interested in this space.

    <p class="article__summary">
—Everything keeps changing


—I’m spread too thin trying to keep up


—I feel like I’ve lost control over my professional life


—I’m starting to regret getting into web development


—I’m tired of constantly chasing new frameworks to make sure I don’t get replaced by an inexperienced college graduate


—Whatever I try to do to keep up is never enough; the changes never stop coming



You’ve barely pushed a feature to production when you notice a new major release of a dependency.
Keeping up with all of the changes in a single framework is next to impossible. Keeping up the framework’s ecosystem is impossible.
So. Many. New. Packages.
So. Many. New. Or. Changed. Standards.
Dozens of new blog posts or articles on how to do stuff appear every day

I can’t keep up; you can’t keep up. Nobody can.
—But I have to keep up! Otherwise, I won’t be able to do my job. Web Development is hell. Maybe I’ll just quit and do something else. Anything else.

People say that web development is unique because of the fast pace and volume of changes in the field. And, since most of us have at least a tangential awareness of other fields through our friends and families (and, in my case, former fields of study), we know that web development seems unique in invoking this feeling of helplessness.
It is unique in overwhelming those of us who practise it, but it isn’t uniquely fast-paced.
I’m not talking here about the difficulty of doing or learning the job.
It’s the task of keeping up with change and new developments in the field once you’re in it. In that regard, web dev isn’t unique.
If anything, compared to fields that still have active research going on (which isn’t the case for software or web dev) like medicine or biotech, the pace of change is arguably much, much lower in web dev.
But, this feeling of being spread too thin, of being unable to keep up, is real. Just not for the reason you think.
So, how do people in other fields keep up with changes in that field? Why is web dev so bad? And, how can we learn from other fields and try not to go mad racing the Red Queen?

“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.”
“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”

First, I’ll tell you about the two approaches that work in other fields but won’t work in web dev because we actually do kind of suck. Pretending otherwise isn’t productive. Then I’ll end with the one approach that genuinely works. It requires work. But that work is still less effort than keeping up with the firehose of change.
1. Other fields have collective or institutional filters
The first method is the one that’s the least useful to us because, as an industry, web dev does not invest in itself as a field. Training is the bare minimum needed to fill jobs. Conferences are mostly for networking. There is little to no active, original research into new approaches or ideas.
But other industries, esp. those who have been around for a while, have institutions and traditions. These provide practitioners with filters to help them stay up-to-date to industry goings-on.
They help you keep up with what’s broadly important, and they have journals and industry rags that help you keep up with what matters; which you then complement by following developments in your primary speciality.
We instead have aggregators that filter very little. Instead of helping us keep up, they become firehoses of content which makes the problem worse.
A web dev equivalent, for example, would be a quarterly publication outlining all of the broadly important news in web dev.
2. They specialise
Cardiologists don’t keep up with experimental Alzheimer’s treatments. Editors and agents in the publishing industry pick the genres they focus on and follow. A developmental linguist specialising in bilingual language acquisition in children isn’t going to be keeping up with the development of natural language processing software models in applied linguistics.
People specialise. They don’t isolate themselves—they’ll still use information from other specialities—but they won’t regard keeping up with those specialities as a core part of their job.
Web dev is unique in how we’ve been trying to roll back the specialisation of the field with notions like Full Stack Web Devs. Fifteen years ago, it seemed obvious to many of us in the industry that the future would involve more specialisation.
Instead, we went the other way and decided: “Hey! Let’s make everybody also code the servers! That’ll save money! Node and browsers are pretty much the same, right? Right?&quot;
We expect people to do the impossible: keep up with everything.
—So, this is hopeless, right? Might as well quit and become an English teacher or something?
There’s one more thing that many fields do that web dev doesn’t. It’s a tactic we can copy as individuals without waiting for a broken industry to fix itself.
3. They stop “Keeping Up” and instead do Research
Students generally start in “keep up” mode. They’re in a new environment like a university. They need to keep up with their coursework, reading, practice, and a new social life. It’s often tough to keep your head above the water. You can do this, as a student, for a few years, but it’s not sustainable for life. So, one of the tasks teachers have, esp. once the students reach the postgraduate stage, is to flick that switch in their minds from “keeping up” mode to “research” mode.
Instead of keeping up with what everybody else is doing, research the task at hand. You let work guide you.
How, exactly, the research is done varies from field to field. Sometimes it’s overtly practice-led like in arts or media. Sometimes it’s directed by your speciality. A lot of the time it’s driven by your thesis question, followed by your research question later in life (Umberto Eco’s How to Write a Thesis explains this one well). The methods and practices vary but new people aren’t expected to just figure it out.
They aren’t expected to keep up with everything and then decide afterwards which bits of everything are related to their work (or not).
These fields spend a lot of effort teaching new entrants research methodology. Choosing your speciality or your question is generally regarded as a Pretty Damn Important Moment.
Web dev as a field doesn’t have a common research methodology or standard tactics for keeping up with change. That’s why we’re all overwhelmed. Not because it’s uniquely fast-paced but because it’s unique in how it doesn’t invest in people, training or methodology.
We don’t teach people to ask the right questions.
The strategy you need to apply is simple: you keep following your feeds, your social media, your subreddits, etc., but you now default to not reading any of it.
You only check out articles, podcasts, or videos that are directly relevant to your Work Questions. (More on that later.) Even then, you still don’t read, watch, or listen to them. You scan them above the fold and ask yourself:
Can I defer reading this until I’m doing the task?
It’s useful to have a library of articles that you know are good references for tasks you may or may not need to do in the future. You don’t need to read any of them right away. Just get into practice at spotting them and filing them away.
There’s no point in religiously reading every blog post on accessible drag and drop in React, or state management with hooks, whenever these articles pop up in your feed. Bookmark them and use them as references when you’re doing that task.
Does this relate to one of my Work Questions?
If it doesn’t touch on one of your long-term goals and isn’t a reference you can use later on to guide you in a task, stop reading and close the tab.
If it’s important it’ll come across your feed again and again. Paradigm-shifting changes in web dev are rare (AJAX, jQuery, React, CSS Media Queries, CSS Grid, CSS Variables, ESM modules). When they do arrive they’ll become so loud and so prevalent in your web dev community that you’d have to work hard not to notice them. Even then, the transition usually takes years.
People are still building projects that don’t use CSS Grid or Variables and bundle together CommonJS modules. Old methods keep on working.
If it does touch on a Work Question you generally need to do a first-pass read to decide how important it is?
Read through it without looking up words or phrases you don’t understand and skip over the hard-to-parse sentences. The goal is to discover whether a deep read is worth the investment or not, so you don’t want to spend too much time on this read.
Sometimes you find articles that don’t add anything to what you know—don’t materially affect the Question—but are still useful references to have, esp. if you need to convey an idea or method to other people, like your colleagues.
Sometimes you’ll find that the article is worth a deep read. You either put in the time right away and give it a deeper re-read, or you file it away to study later.
For example, one of my Work Questions is “How can I make a web UI that doesn’t feel flat but also isn’t a skeuomorphic cartoon pastiche of real-world objects?”. Anything that touches on filters, gradients, or texture effects in CSS will catch my interest. When Ahmad Shadeed’s article on radial and conic gradients came across my feed I scanned it to make sure it was relevant. Then I filed it away for re-read later (which, to be fair, just involved opening as a tab in the browser window that holds research related to current work). After re-reading, I bookmarked it properly so that I could refer to it later when I’m using gradient effects.
If it doesn’t relate to a Work Question and isn’t a how-to reference for a future task, ignore it and move on
Really. I don’t need to follow the ins and outs of React state management. You don’t need to know about the state of modern JS support in XHTML. You should be ignoring most of the goings-on in the web development community.
How do we choose our Work Questions?
Now we get to the tricky part. The good news is that you don’t need to figure this out in one go. You can start with many vague questions and, as you do your research, you either cross them off or rephrase them to become more specific.
They are supposed to change over time. Some of them should be dictated by your current tasks. Others can be more aspirational: ask questions related to the work you want to be doing.
For example, here are the questions that guide my web dev research when it comes to my Colophon Cards project:

How do you provide a lightweight yet nicely interactive front end? Anything that comes across my feed that’s about doing more with less—smaller bundle sizes, fewer dependencies, faster loading, etc.—on the front end piques my interest as a possible answer.
How can I better manage the project’s CSS? Continue to use bundling? Continue to use CUBE? How do the approaches from Every Layout work in this context?
As I wrote above: How can I make a web UI that doesn’t feel flat but also isn’t a skeuomorphic cartoon pastiche of real-world objects? I think UX generally suffers in flat UI design as it doesn’t leverage layering, affordances, and metaphors to the degree that it could. I’m very curious about breaking out of flatland.
Can I integrate accessibility features into UX designs as obvious-yet-attractive affordances instead of constantly being hidden from view? Wabi-sabi used to be a common reference in web design circles. An example of this would be to make focus styles overt and obvious. But in an aesthetically pleasing way.
How can we make browser-based reading more powerful, more useful, and more accessible than other forms of reading?
Is it possible to make Multi-Page Apps as engaging and ‘snazzy’ as Single-Page-Apps?
What are the simplest kinds of state management tactics that’ll work for a web app? Esp. in a vanilla JS or web component-based app.
Is it possible to build this kind of app using only serverless-style services without having to geta PhD in AWS and CloudFormation?
What are the best ways to implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for a vanilla JS or web components app?
SVG WTF? Just, SVG. WTF? I need to understand SVG better.

You’ll note that these questions range from the high level to the low level. Some of them focus on practical details of a specific technology. Others are more ‘chewable’. Some of them are specific and will eventually have a clear answer. Others are open-ended and represent the ongoing development of a work philosophy or outlook.
The questions change with the job. When I’ve had projects that involve PDF-rendering in the browser, then that (“What’s the best way to render a PDF in a browser?&quot;) became one of my Work Questions. “How can CSS Grids help with my layouts?” was once a big question. But I dropped it once I felt I had a handle on it. I still rely on the reference articles I bookmarked when I was doing that research.

I set aside about an hour or two a day for research.
I sit down with a cup of coffee and go through my social media, my feed reader, and a couple of select online sources. I filter out articles and papers based on whether they touch on one of my questions or whether they look like a ‘how-to’ that I can file away.
I rarely need to spend the entire two hours. It isn’t unusual for me to go over all of my sources in about 30 minutes and come away with nothing relevant. That’s when I switch to active research and proactively look for sources and references related to the questions I have.
And that’s how “keeping up” stops being a chore and becomes an interest-driven research activity that feeds your enthusiasm instead of draining it.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">I can’t be the only one who is just bone-tired after the past two years. I can’t blame it just on That Disease or OMG Politics. The problem is that everything else keeps going. Every year, there is some balance between the good and bad. But pandemic times add two colossal rocks to the ‘bad’ side of the scale. Then the regular bad stuff continues to pile on.
I know this. So why do I feel guilty about productivity (or lack thereof) over the past two weeks?
I’m guessing I’m not alone.
Looking back at the past year to take stock makes me even more depressed.
In an attempt to counter this perspective-induced ennui, I’d like to take stock of the future instead. Instead of looking over the things that either almost happened last year (but never quite did) or happened (but not as successfully as I hoped), I’d like to look at some of the things that could be interesting in 2022.

Work and ideas for work
I’m still working on how to position myself—how my skill set could best benefit people. I’m kicking around a few ideas on how I could do that, but in the meantime, I still have time for new projects and jobs, so get in touch if you think I might help you.
I’ve realised that I have a lot of knowledge and have done a lot of reading on research and decision-making processes. Some of this was a part of my last job’s focus on helping academic researchers. Some of it is how I’ve applied methods and tactics from my arts and humanities background to coding. I’ve noticed that many developers feel underwater, find it hard to keep up, feel lost when they need to begin new projects or tasks and don’t realise that there is help out there. People say that web development is unique in the fast pace and volume of changes in the field.
That, strictly speaking, isn’t true. That there is a fast pace is true. And the volume of changes feels all-encompassing. What it isn’t is unique. Social sciences, health research, economics and investment, many fields of science, all face similar problems with managing your research and news.
What is useful is that many of them have been dealing with this pace for a little bit longer than web dev and have come up with a few helpful approaches.
There are three prongs to the approach I’d like to take to this (subject to change, as always):

On frameworks and stacks. For the past six months, I’ve been trying to formalise my approach to navigating the various tech stack and framework choices I deal with in web development. It’s based on the processes taught at art school, which doesn’t just teach you how to practice but what to practice, whose practice you study, why they did what they did, all to help you figure out what to do with your work. With a bit of Thomas S. Kuhn mixed in. This one could take a while.
When to read, when to bookmark, and when to Google. How to do the practice-led research that we should all be doing as web developers. The web development training programs that I’m aware of don’t teach this. But they should.
Practice-led note-taking. Zettelkasten is a note-taking strategy out of social sciences that’s popular in certain online circles today. It works well when you’re working on novel ideas and new theories in your field. It doesn’t work well for practice-led research which is what most developers do. Umberto Eco’s approach, from his How to Write a Thesis, is, in my view, a better tactic when the research has to have a specific outcome (thesis, program, website, etc.). I’d like to figure out specific ways to adapt this idea to web dev research. But in the meantime, you can read and enjoy Eco’s original book. I highly recommend it.

Web devving it
I love web development and it’s still going to be a big part of what I do, esp. since I’m still working on my own website and web apps (see Colophon Cards below).
But I keep changing my mind as to whether I should focus my time on coding-oriented web dev topics or not. I have a strong preference for ‘vanilla’ JS approaches (that is, using browser-provided APIs directly) and I tried my hand at writing about those topics. I’m just not convinced that trying to teach others how to effectively use browser-provided APIs for web dev is a productive use of my time. But maybe I’m just getting jaded after years of constantly seeing people apply the React hammer to every web dev nail, screw, bolt, or fastener in sight.
I’ll write posts on the approaches and methods I’ll be using in my web dev practice (like Colophon Cards) but I’m still on the fence as to whether I should push beyond that.
I have a suspicion that I might have a greater impact—be more helpful to people—by writing about research and process for web dev. But I’ll only find out by testing it.
Writing
I wrote a few mega-posts last year that might even qualify as short books:

Software Crisis 2.0, on how software goes bad.
136 facts every web dev should know before they burn out and turn to landscape painting or nude modelling, full of bite-sized advice and opinions.
Lessons in Interactivity, 2021 redux, an overview over the past decade.

I’d like to take these long essays and extract as many focused ‘one problem, one solution’ blog posts out of them. Take each concept and frame it with the problem it solves.
I’d also like to put together a proper book-type thing or two this year. Could be fun.
Colophon Cards
From the site:

My goal with Colophon Cards is to create a web-based note-taking app for bookmarking and reading websites, ebooks, and documents.

I got a grant to prototype a web app that marries ideas from both traditional card-based note-taking approaches with hypertextual digital note-taking apps.
Making is a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to putting the prototype together.
Other Stuff
I’d like to get back into regular practice with my photography. The past four years have, honestly, been a bit frantic and I haven’t taken the time that I should have to go out and take pictures.
I did manage to do a bit of it over the past year. Let’s hope 2022 will see even more.

    <p class="article__summary">There are tasks that computers are good at. And there are tasks where they aren’t. One driver of the evolution of the personal computer, laptops, mobile phones, and all forms of mobile computing has been the desire to increase their range: do more; in a smaller package. Many in tech and software are addicted to riding this wave of new capabilities, however long it will last, to work on and create new software. To extend the reach of the computers in our lives.
Innovation’s the word. Pushing the boundaries. You know the phrases. Usually spouted by that dude at the party.
The other side is also interesting. We are now in a place where we have entire genres of software that have decades of history, are backed by stacks of new and old research, have dozens of successful, well-made exemplar apps, and a broad enough conceptual space to allow for new variations on the theme.
In short, we have genre software and we have avant-garde software, and I’ve always been more interested in genre fiction than literary fiction.
One of the earliest genres of software is the Personal Knowledge or Information Manager—arguably as old as the computer mouse itself. Managing data is one of the tasks computers have always been good at, so we’ve been making software in that genre for decades.
Outliners, hypertext systems, note-taking apps, personal information databases—we’ve been doing this for a while and, because software is inherently ephemeral, we make new iterations for every generation.
Sometimes, such as with Tinderbox or DEVONThink, the new iterations are new versions of the original software. Sometimes, such as with Bear, Ulysses, Roam, or Obsidian, it’s a new take on the genre. Not so new that you don’t recognise it for it is, and not so innovative that it doesn’t reuse what worked for other apps, but new variations that are adapted to work well in our current computing context.
That isn’t even close to a comprehensive list. There’s also Evernote, Drafts, 1Writer—even Apple’s Notes app has evolved to become impressively useful. And I’m still only scratching the surface.
These apps are also extremely diverse. There’s an increasing tendency for software, in this age of ‘flat’, to all look the same. Same design. Same aesthetic. Same icons. Same fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) concept mapped onto a specific problem domain. But you’d never mistake a screenshot of Bear for one of Tinderbox or Ulysses. You’d never look at Roam and think to yourself: “huh? That looks exactly like DEVONThink.”
I’ve been working in or adjacent to this space for the past five years, with varying degrees of success and you can probably tell that I’m a little bit obsessed with the genre.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that I’m working on my contribution to the genre.
I’ve wanted to build a specific take on the note-oriented personal information manager for myself for a long time.
This summer I applied for a grant from the Technology Development Fund at The Icelandic Centre for Research to create a prototype of a notetaking app that I’m calling…
Colophon Cards
While the app itself won’t be open source (though some bits of it might be), I’ve gotten used to following the open-source ethos of working publicly and transparently.
So, over the next six months (or longer if I’m successful) I’m going to be documenting the process, the design, development, research, marketing, discussion with my advisers, and other details, at colophon.cards.
As you can probably tell from the site, I began a few days ago.

The front page is the first version of the pitch for the app and my specific approach.
The first design notes are a high-level sketch of how it should work.
The data model are my first attempt at structuring it.
The sharing model outlines how I envision collaboration to work.
Attachments and bookmarks are about how information management works. I like this one so much that I edited it into the front page pitch, as I’m sure you can tell.
Reading and viewing outlines my take on what’s missing in the field in terms of reading features in knowledge management apps.
The business model is a rough sketch of what I imagine the business model to be. Not because I’m anywhere near launching this but because you can’t design an app without having a sense of its business model and its margins.
The questions that need to be answered are just that. Open questions that I need to find answers to.

Additionally, you can follow my work on the website and comment with an issue on the GitHub repository. (Work on the software itself will be in a private repository.)
The notes I’ve been posting are rough and unedited. They are work products, not essays or marketing, those belong here on this site. You can follow Colophon Cards news by following the mailing list using the form on the site (this is a separate mailing list from the one on this site), by following its feed, or by watching the GitHub repository.
I’ll also make sure to post about major updates here on this site.
I’m enjoying the process a lot and I hope that you’ll enjoy it with me.</p>

    <p class="article__summary">For the first time in my life, I felt the urge to comment on Reddit.
Over on r/webdev, this here question popped up:

Do you think reading css articles like css-tricks &amp; smashing magazine is waste of time?

This question isn’t really about the two sites mentioned but about the frustration we all feel with the endless treadmill of keeping up with what’s happening in web dev. Especially, since a lot of it feels so unproductive:

Articles on features that haven’t shipped yet and may never ship everywhere.
Advanced features that address specialised use cases you’re never going to encounter.
Masturbatory “let’s do this without any JS!” articles that end up being much more complicated than adding, like, a line or two of JS.

It’s a lot. It’s frustrating. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Which is the reason why I felt the urge to reply with the following. Hopefully others will find it helpful.

So, I’ve been making websites since before CSS was a thing and using CSS since before absolute positioning was a thing which I guess makes me … intermediate? Maybe? 😄
You don’t have to keep running the gossip treadmill to keep up. This applies to CSS, JS, HTML and the rest. As you observe, memorising partially implemented new standards, many of which may not even end up adopted as actual standards, isn’t a productive use of anybody’s time.
Treat it like you would a gossip column covering people in your field: read it for fun, don’t over-invest, don’t feel bad about missing out on it. There’s a lot of gossip out there so there’s a lot to ignore.
What I’ve found does pay off is focusing on doing different kinds of reading:
There’s the aforementioned gossip—new news so new that it may not ever be useful. You don’t want to spend much time on web dev gossip in general (JS dev news is often even more gossipy).
Then you have the more detailed how-tos, some of which may be covering recent-ish standards, but are mostly about features you can use right away. Ahmad Shadeed’s blog has many good examples of this which I highly recommend. You read these texts to get a sense of what the platform can do. You don’t need to memorise how it is done. Just know that it can be done.
Then you have problem analysis and solutions. These posts go over specific problems and how you might solve them. Josh W Comeau’s blog is full of these kinds of posts. Sara Soueidan’s blog is also a good source. Lea Verou’s as well. Smashing Magazine and CSS-Tricks have a lot of these kinds of posts as well, so I would have another look at them if I were you. You were reading them as industry gossip (which they do provide) but it sounds like you weren’t getting the full value that these sites have to offer in terms of howtos and problem solutions.
These sites you read—scan mostly—and you bookmark individual posts that you find interesting so that you can refer to them later if you run into the problem they’ve solved yourself. (Which reminds me: I recommend using a bookmarking service so you can find your bookmarks even when you aren’t logged into your preferred browser.)
Another important type of reading is higher level or workflow level analysis. Such as the CUBE CSS site. Reading about how to organise your work is some of the most productive learning you can do. Every Layout is another example as it’s fundamentally about how you optimally structure your CSS for composition and reuse. These you read, study, and reread. You don’t have to agree with everything they say, but you should be able to answer (for yourself) why you would disagree with them.
Finally, there’s synthesis. That’s when you start to read texts that are adjacent to your work so that you become better at addressing those problems on your end. For those, you would be reading blogs on accessibility (like Adrian Roselli’s) or design (like Stephanie Walter’s) or the link blog of a web developer who is also doing cross-discipline synthesis reading (like Jeremy Keith’s, which I highly recommend.)
You don’t have to understand everything on all of the sites in this last bucket. Those are more for building a shared vocabulary and mindset with other specialities that you will be working with.
Of course, checking these sites every day is a huge pain, especially since most of them aren’t updated every day. This is why a feed reader, such as Feedly, is gold. You can’t trust that new posts to these sites will pop up on the aggregation sites you follow.
A rule of thumb is that the importance of a blog in your feed reader is inversely proportional to their posting cadence. Prioritise the blogs that post only once a month or every couple of weeks over those that post every day or multiple times a day. You don’t want to miss a new Ahmad Shadeed post but there’s no harm in skipping the CSS-Tricks firehose for a few days. Building up a large library of sporadically updated blogs is much more useful and much easier to keep up with than trying to keep up with a handful of aggregation sites every day.
The benefit to this approach is that it isn’t time-sensitive. If you look at the posting cadence of the core blogs I mentioned, you can go away for half a year and they won’t have that many new posts for you to catch up on. 99% of the rest that has piled up while you were away is just gossip that you can ‘mark as read’ without any guilt.
So, to answer your question: yes, you should still be reading these sites, but you should change how you read them and add a few others into the mix. 🙂</p>

    <p class="article__summary">Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn’t support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users&#039; lives easier.

    <p class="article__summary">Last month we removed a bunch of content from MDN. MDN is 16 years old (and yes it can drink in some countries), all that time ago it was a great place for all of Mozilla to document all of their things. As MDN evolved and the web reference became our core content, other areas became less relevant to the overall site. We have ~11k active pages on MDN, so keeping them up to date is a big task and we feel our focus should be there.

Also this release we see a few nice JavaScript additions, including private fields and methods for classes, and the at() method for Array, String and TypedArray global objects.

    <p class="article__summary">When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

It is January February already, and it feels like time flies. In the world of technology, there are always so many news, trends, and possible distractions. On top of that, we already have so much work to do, projects to finish, and people to please. It is easy to feel empty or get burned out. Plus, we still live in the middle of an uncomfortable situation for everyone, a so far unseen pandemic situation; This causes a lot of mental problems on its own and drains a lot of energy from us.
What we can do in this case — although it’s hard to accept — is slowing down.
When I feel overwhelmed, I try to go outside as much as possible. I will get some fresh air, have a long walk and reflect on the things I do. I try to answer the question: »What brings me joy in web development?«. After that, I find myself working more calmly and happily.
Now, if you have the time and energy, you can read through some interesting articles we curated for you. This week, Malte wrote the intro.
Generic

	Cory Doctorow by the EFF shares some of the issues of today’s web and how that may change over the next years as both U.S. and the EU initialized law proposals for better interoperability of services and software. There’s quite some interesting stuff in the article.
	Arnold Galovics shares his first-hand experiences with microservices. He offers some strong arguments on why microservices might not be a good fit for your next project.

UI/UX

	Josh W. Cameau blogged about his custom CSS reset which includes a nice idea of more variable, better line-height via calc()
	Oliver Schöndorfer in the ideal line length and line heigh in web design. He shares examples of what doesn’t work and how to improve legibility of a website with some easy and generic rules.
	Icones.js is a huge collection of iconsets with a preview.

Tooling

	esbuild is a new JavaScript compiler that’s super fast and could shake up the current tooling world.
	ParcelCSS is a super fast parser, transpiler, and minified for CSS. It’s so fast because it’s not a node.js tool but written in Rust.

Security

	This is something I love to see coming to our browsers: The HTML Sanitizer API. If that becomes reality, we finally get a safer frontend web and our written JavaScript code is slimmer and less bloated up with sanitising libraries. Until then (and maybe afterwards as we still need it for some cases), we can use DOMPurify.

Web Performance

	It’s not been long ago that we’ve seen HTTP/2 making a huge impact to website performance. Now HTTP/3 is here and brings another set of performance benefits.

HTML &amp; SVG

	Did you know you can control autocapitalization in user input with the autocapitalize property?

Accessibility

	Stephanie Eckles has a short code snippet how to standardise focus styles on a web project easily with CSS custom properties.

JavaScript

	This cool JavaScript snippet offers &quot;add event to calendar&quot; buttons for websites.
	Stephanie Eckles explains how to use the Intersection Observer Web API as a performant way to track where elements are in the viewport and other scrollable regions.
	Doeke Norg shares how to use JavaScript generators instead of iterating through arrays with traditional methods.
	What’s the state of ES6 native modules in our browsers? Right now, it’s still a bit complicated but things get better and once a few more things land in browsers, we may finally reduce the complexity of frontend code and workspaces again.

CSS

	Bramus Van Damme shares what’s to expect in 2022 from CSS — which could be a lot. Things like Container Queries, Cascade Layers, Color functions, better viewport units, Parent (:has()) selector, Subgrid, Accent color, Media Query ranges.
	Temani Afif shares an approach how to build reponsive layouts with less media queries based on the way we note Flex and Grid patterns. By using min, max, clamp or autofit functions, we reduce the complexity of media queries.
	The CSS :has() selector is way more than a “Parent Selector”.
	This CSS snippet collection by 30 seconds of code contains great utilities and interactive CSS modules, such as custom checkbox styling, scroll snap, and lots more.
	Stefan Judis explains how the hwb() color syntax works and why it’s probably the easiest to work and understand as human. Safari and Firefox both recently implemented it with others to follow soon hopefully.
	CSS has come a long way since the early days of web development, when tables and various other hacks were used for layout and positioning. Today&#039;s developers can enjoy writing CSS that works in all major browsers, without having to bend over backwards to implement tricky layout requirements. Not only does this make it easier to create dynamic layouts, but it also allows you to ship smaller (and simpler) stylesheets by removing unnecessary cruft. In this article, we&#039;ll look at various scenarios where modern techniques can reduce the complexity of your code and allow you to write better CSS.

Work &amp; Life

	
 I was busy and productive, which made me feel important and accomplished. Yet my heart told me a different story.

Andrew Rocha on how to prioritise important things and why everything else is extra. Apps aren’t solving these matters, we need to.

Go beyond…

	When we buy something, we get an immediate boost. But what happens once we have the item for a few days? Most of the time, it doesn’t match our expectations of becoming a happier person by buying it. Leo shares his findings on buying less and focus on the inner self to solve these issues. With that in mind, we tend to buy only really useful things while being happier overall. Win-win.
	There is currently a lot of hype around crypto and web3 around. Moxie Marlinspike shares his impressions and down-to-earth thoughts on those topics. But even if you’re not very interested in web3, this article reveals a couple of interesting problems with the current system. For example the fact that “Even nerds do not want to run their own servers at this point.”
	As service platform provider, should you clean up your inactive users regularly or collect them for your numbers instead? Here’s the Flare app team sharing why and how they remove inactive users and teams.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. I want to say thank you to everyone here who reads or supports this project.
This year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time. But nature has helped me, my child has helped me, meditation and focusing on my own opinion, on my own body, on my own health helps me staying sane. A big reveal was during my Covid infection: Once I realised how “pre-informed” I was about the disease, I stripped out this bias and listened to my body instead, my health improved next day and recovery was very quick from then on while it stalled over some days before. I share this because I think it’s very important to listen to yourself, to keep track on your own health instead of being drawn down by everyday TV shows that don’t even offer any solution but only share how bad everything is.
My wish for the future is to empower you to be your own you. You already have the ability, now to find out how to enable it. It may not be the easiest but probably worth it.
There’s a new year coming and I’d love to see that more people will trust their own mind and body again and work towards this goal. Read you next year!

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. At this point I want to say thank you to every single reader, to everyone who supports me, sends me feedback or suggestions. I love this project so much because my readership (you!) is so amazing.

When I looked up something these days in my archive, I realised how true the introduction from last year is still today.
On the topic of creating for the web: I personally think micro-typography, good translations and good content writing matters a lot to the success of a product. So I wrote an article on well crafted translations and why automation isn’t good enough yet, showing some prominent examples that just aren’t good enough.
News

	PHP loses one of its main contributors but the good part is that this triggered a process of building the PHP foundation. This is cool because it’s a new level of stability for the product that most of the internet builds on.
	Each year, a couple of big companies publish the news color trends for the upcoming year. This time, I found Shutterstock’s Color Trends 2022 and have to say I like their way of defining it, showing it and just delivering one hex color code for it. With Pantone Color Trends it’s more tricky and I just realised they now sell an entire book on trends and only publish some fashion color trends for the next year without providing any useful color codes anymore.

Generic

	Arjuna Sky Kok wrote a pretty complete guide on how to create, retrieve and format date and time in PHP.
	Brent Roose &amp; Freek Van der Herten published a free modern PHP cheat sheet, serving also as summary of all awesome PHP features up to PHP8.1.

UI/UX

	Line length revisited: following the research is a in-depth article on typography and reading experience challenging the status quo of how wide a text should flow. By Mary Dyson.
	Kelley Gordon shares how we can use the golden ratio for UI design. A pretty interesting read I used a lot in past projects already since I heard of the concept in school. Back then I learned what it does, how important it is for photography and so I applied it naturally for designs as well. Nowadays I think it’s not applicable everywhere or for all projects but often helps to design better interfaces.

Tooling

	ssshape is a SVG blob/shape generator that is pretty handy for nice elements when you don’t want to open one of the big vector applications.

Web Performance

	Harsh people say Safari is the new Internet Explorer, but we should remind ourselves that real people are working on the Safari web browser. So let us treat them with respect and be friendly. On November 15th, there was an amazing Safari release. Safari Tech Preview now has lazy image loading, accent-color for browser UI controls enabled by default and supports dynamic viewport units, flex-basis: content, and rel=&quot;noopener/noreferrer&quot; for form elements. Pretty cool for just one preview release, isn’t it?

JavaScript

	Ivaylo Gerchev shares the Vue 3 Composition API and its advantages over previous methods. If you’re using Vue, this is a cool intro and comparison what to use for which solution.
	Until near future, we need to reverse an array to find values or its index in an JavaScript array which causes an array mutation and is a memory-increasing action. Luckily, there&#039;s an ECMAscript proposal for findLast and findLastIndex.
	Rematch.js is using the best practices from Redux but without the boilerplate and it’s super tiny (2kb). It has TypeScript support, native async/await, a simple plugin API, and needs no configuration. Usable with React, Vue, Angular or others.

CSS

	A sticky footer solution by Sílvio Rosa that only needs two lines of CSS. Sticky footer means the element is on the bottom of the page even if not enough content is there while not being in fixed position on the site as well.
	Ahmad Shadeed often writes about little findings in CSS that are super useful. Such as this one where he explains why position: sticky does not work automatically with CSS Grid and how to use them in combination.
	It looks like there is finally a way to animate a dynamic height using only CSS. Nelson Menezes shows us how he achieved this in a funny and interesting read.
	This is a very interesting case of why it’s best to avoid !important: While you can use !important in CSS Custom Properties, it doesn’t work as we’re used to. Instead, it’s stripped from the definition by the parser but influences the CSS cascade. See the article to understand this better.

Go beyond…

	Habits and streaks are cool but what happens usually when we miss a day and break our streak? We tend to let the habit fall completely. When things aren’t going according to plan, Practicing with Zero is simply pausing, and deciding how we want to proceed from here. With intention.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

thanks for all the feedback that reached me last time, it was awesome to read that so many people support me even when my schedule of writing isn’t regular. Now that I had a thought on how to continue with WDRL I realised that this project won’t be sold, won’t be transferred to someone else or such thing. It’s just too personal to do this. But Malte Riechmann will help me collect and write some links from this edition on — it’s all in the early stages but I’m glad because it will help me and save me time.
In the past two weeks I had the chance to think about a lot of things that are influencing our lives at the moment. It made me realise that it’s upon us how we see our worlds, how we see the problems of our world. It’s our choice how we deal with other people, whether we confront people, cut them short, or whether we’re calm, interested and open minded. I know the latter is not possible all the time, but trying is really worth it. If we understand each other better, we create emotions, we can hold together, we will get stronger and happier. We can support each other in unstable situations, when we’re not sure what to do or what to believe. It’s the community that works for humans, and it’s hate and envy that boosts the bad things in life. We choose our path every day.
To make this easier for myself, I blocked all major news sites via pi-hole DNS for my devices again for an unlimited time. You can also set 1.1.1.2 for families as baseline and fallback.
News

	Safari 15 now has WebExtensions on iOS and iPadOS, supports theme-color meta tag, supports CSS aspect-ratio, new color syntaxes. The web inspector features a CSS Grid helper, ES6 modules are now supported in  Workers and ServiceWorkers. Top-level await, Error.cause, private class methods and accessors are supported, too. And more…

Generic

	Pawel Grzybek explains the history of the @. It is always interesting to know where icons and signs come from. We usually cannot remember their original meaning. E. g. think about the disc icon, which often stands for save in user interfaces.
	Web development is only as complex as the belonging requirements. Therefore we should thrive for simpler solutions and fewer options. Jason Fried writes about this in one of his recent blog posts.

UI/UX

	Arco is an intelligent design system with code and design files available. Pretty cool!

Tooling

	We can now go to vscode.dev with our web browsers and a lightweight version of VS Code will start. It is pretty amazing how far web development has come. We can directly begin coding without installing anything. With Chrome and Edge we can even open entire directories into the web application using the File System Access API.

Web Performance

	Johan Isaksson tells us how he improved a Google app’s scroll performance 10x by simply adding an old CSS table property. What does this tell us? That we as developers should always think about whether there are native HTML or CSS solutions out there instead of JavaScript.

HTML &amp; SVG

	Within the last few years, all of us created hamburger menus. And probably all of us made some kind of mistake while doing so. Manuel Matuzović summarizes and explains these mistakes very well. He also shows a valid, semantic, and well-structured hamburger menu.
	Writing and understanding semantically correct HTML is still one of the important basics in web development. Ben Myers brings to us some details on the &lt;dl&gt; HTML element.

Accessibility

	Jake Archibald shares why emotions matter when writing alt text for images.

JavaScript

	I love simple solutions. That’s why I love this simple in-page filter search written in a few lines of plain JavaScript. A few years ago, I’ve built something similar but back then it required a few more lines and wasn’t that neat due to missing JavaScript functions.
	The JavaScript console object can do so much more than console.log(). Marko Denic shows us all the different features so we can improve our JavaScript debugging and become better web developers.
	These unstyled, accessible React components are nice because we just need to style them. No need to reinvent the functionality all the time.

CSS

	This article is a good reminder of how object-fit and background-size work. Ahmad Shadeed goes into detail and explains to us when and when not to use these CSS properties. He also shows us how to fix the padding hack with the CSS property aspect-ratio.
	Stephanie Eckles explains how to style radio buttons the modern way with CSS Grid layout, currentColor, appearance and em units. No images, no weird absolute positioning or similar.
	With plain CSS we can now achieve sticky section indicators in definition lists. Pretty neat and something we had to do for years with comparably complex JavaScript code.
	Do you know @supports can not only check on CSS properties but on CSS selectors, too? In one of his latest articles, Chris Coyier tells us all about this helpful CSS feature.
	We all have used CSS hacks. Especially in the early days, those were sometimes the only solution to problems. Today we rarely see them anymore. But have a look at this interesting CSS hack from the developers at Facebook.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

no, you didn’t miss an edition, I just failed to write again. The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.
Security

	Jake Archibald teaches us how we win at CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This is great because it’s one of the trickier things to test, debug and grasp CORS as a developer.

HTML &amp; SVG

	Christian Kozalla shows the proper approach to implement and style a dialog element to show a dialog/overlay/modal to a user.

Accessibility

	Eric Eggert explains the differences between buttons and links and why we shouldn’t just use what we want to for our web apps but the proper types instead.

JavaScript

	Livewire is a nice technology to use in dynamic Laravel apps. Caleb Porzio shares how it works and how to use it in a deep dive article.
	If you’re using Laravel already, here’s a nice alternative to the hosted services for adding a support bubble to your website.
	Vizzu is a library for animated data visualizations and data stories. Here’s an overview of what it can do.

CSS

	Stefan Judis shares how we can do conditional border-radius today but future holds a much more readable approach for us.
	Chris Coyier shares future additions currently in development for CSS, and they’re super cool. It would allow for native nesting, container queries and units, cascade layers, @when (native if/else), and scoping. Alle we ever wished for in the past decade.
	David Hall explains how much of a difference a well crafted drop shadow makes for interaction. I love these detailed explanations of something that looks very simple.
	Chris Coyier on the different degrees of custom property usage and why the decision how to do it fully depends on the context of the team and project we’re working in.
	First of all I’m convinced that absolute positioning in CSS has its value and its use-cases. But in many cases it also creates new problems, especially in responsive and modular contexts. So this documentation of use-cases where we don’t need absolute positioning in CSS anymore is great.
	Mikael Ainalem shares an approach to create pop-out effects in CSS using clip-path().
	We know a lot of the techniques highlighted in this article from our work as CSS developers. But gladly with new techniques we can switch away from pseudo-element hacks to more stable solutions today.
	There’s a new CSS property called accent-color which makes it quick and easy to roll out global styles.

Work &amp; Life

	Long time ago I wrote this piece and had the intend to let it publish somewhere else. But it didn’t happen so here it is on my personal blog: It’s time for a healthy tech approach.

Go beyond…

	Berwyn Powell considers the impact of a web application or website on carbon emissions and how we can reduce them as developers.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

this time we’re going to look deeply into a lot of CSS articles together with optimising images. In CSS, we get nice tools that help us create better layouts, faster. We also look at new technologies like parent selectors, like responsive images in CSS, reverting CSS settings and container queries.
One thing that I recognize now that I have my gardening job is that I finally am able to look at web things from a more distant perspective. Which is nice because I now don’t spend any thoughts and nerves on discussions about »native HTML« and similar things that drive Twitter’s platform and make it so negative. When reading my Twitter feed, often a little bit later than the tweets were written, so many things seem unnecessary to me. Previously, I struggled with it a lot and spent hours wasting time on topics that in reality aren’t relevant to me as a person or for our community. I learnt that what matters really is doing something for the community instead of arguing against other people’s opinions. It’s one of the reasons why I started writing the newsletter again, it’s why I organise events here in my neighbourhood nowadays.
Enjoy your week with a smile now, no matter what your brain says. Worth a try, isn’t it?
—Anselm
Generic

	We all love regular expressions, don’t we? Here’s a guide how to write better RegExp in PHP.

Web Performance

	Jake Archibald shares another summary of how to serve sharp images to high density screens while saving data efficiently.

CSS

	Chris Coyier shares the differences and use cases for inherit, initial, unset and revert properties in CSS.
	Ahmad Shadeed shares how to make custom scrollbars in CSS the modern way. While this is very useful, don’t style them unless you really need this. Also, keep in mind the different light/dark modes and high contrast and other media queries and helpful accessibility functionality.
	This layout generator lets you create and adjust CSS Grid layouts very easily with a UI.
	Let’s talk about Flexbox: “How can we create equal columns with Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/)? This is the best example to show why we now have Flexbox and CSS Grid but none could ever replace the other, they’re for different purposes.
	LayoutIt! is another layout generator for CSS Grids, a bit different in its UI than the other one mentioned in the newsletter. Both great, try them!
	Max Böck on media queries in times of container queries. While we’re inclined to think container queries would replace media queries in all cases, that’s not entirely true. For page layouts itself, media queries will stay the easiest and most suitable solution. For small projects where we don’t necessarily need a huge component system, they will be the go to solution. For big projects, they will play a smaller role in future.
	Adrian Bece explores an early draft of :has(), a CSS parent selector that may come into our browsers soon.
	Someone remembers image-set() in CSS? Safari supports it since a long time, actually before we had picture support. Now Firefox added support, so we can have another look into it and check the use-cases: Responsive images in CSS.


I hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

this week I want to share thoughts from Jens Oliver Meiert on »Listening« with you. I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too. So I’ll promise to myself now again to do my best to get better at not dismissing other opinions straight away.
News

	Chrome now supports the import of JSON modules.
	Apple just announced Safari 15 that’s coming in autumn and here are the highlights: Support for HTML attribute autocomplete=one-time-code (2FA), CSS aspect-ratio, lab(), lch(), hwb() color syntaxes, theme-color meta tag supoport, and in JavaScript top level await, ES6 Modules in Service Workers and Workers, Error.cause. Apart from that a lot of privacy and security enhancements are coming as well as WebGL2, and Web Share level 2.

Generic

	A little bit of a different view that shows the benefits of auto deleting inactive users from your platform. When you do, your database will get faster, more secure, and easier to handle and administrate. In the end, inactive users make a great number but the platform itself doesn’t benefit from them. Care about those on your platform.

UI/UX

	Flagpack is a set of flags we can use for internationalization and languages choosers on our apps and websites. It’s open source.

Tooling

	HeadlessUI is a set of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS. Designed for React and Vue.

Web Performance

	Fork is a lightweight solution for running PHP code concurrently.

Accessibility

	Sandrina Pereira explains us how to make disabled buttons more inclusive.
	Kitty Giraudel shares how to implement an accessible toggle component in your app.
	Vitaly Friedman wrote up a complete guide to accessible front-end components. This is worth reading it again from time to time.

CSS

	David Bushell argues for using start and end as syntax instead of left and right for a more universal layout language.
	Adam Argyle shares how to create split-text animations and word animations the proper way.
	Jim Nielsen reveals the system colors we can use in CSS and how useful this can be for light and dark mode themes.
	Barry Pollard shares how we can control font loading with less impact to the rendering with the cool new CSS Font Descriptors feature.

Work &amp; Life

	This is a great piece of content on how less is often more. Kent C. Dodds shares with the example of electric cars why sometimes we need to think entirely different to what we’re used to to simplify things. Electric cars need less maintenance and are easier to build because they need less parts. If we apply that to our life, or to building websites we can save ourselves from a lot of trouble.
	Julia Evans shares helpful advice on how to improve the relationship to your manager by telling them thing they might not know, such as why the team might be slow, what the technical debt is, what goals you may have, the extra work people in the team are doing, and more.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

it’s been a long while and I’ll start with a big sorry to all my loyal readers over the past years. I’ve neglected this project since January this year and just now found enough time to bring it back to life. Why to life? Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget it’s a great option.
I’m busy with my market garden business growing lots of food which works fine despite weather surprises us here again with colder than usual temperatures and lots of rain over the past weeks. But we now serve over 40 customers, which means we give food to around 80 – 100 people every week during growing period. This is an awesome feeling!
In parallel I spend a lot of time seeing my son grow up, playing with him. When there’s enough time I work on small website projects and try to organize an event about soil and climate action in summer here in Germany. Let’s see if it’s possible to make this event real.
The political and social situation we’re currently in continues to baffle me and surprise me. Mostly not in a positive way though which means I’m spending more time reflecting on my thoughts and news, meditating for my mind and to stay sane and calm. I stuggle to accept that so many people have hardline-thoughts in a specific direction, I don’t even care so much in which one. But I think we’re still individuals and every single person should be able to think on their own and decide on their own (thinking as a social, empathic being).
News

	Safari 14.1 is an interesting one because it’s a minor update but brings great joy for us developers: Flexbox gap support, Date &amp; Time Inputs on macOS (woohoo!), WebM support to name the big ones.

Generic

	Una Kravets recaps the new complexity of building modern responsive designs for the web. But there’s a new player called Container Queries in the house which makes many things for us developers easier to work with a component driven system.

Web Performance

	Silvestar Bistrović shares useful tools for auditing CSS.
	Barry Pollard explains how Core Web Vitals work and what we should do as developers to get a better score by Google.

HTML &amp; SVG

	Amber Wilson shares the love story of HTML input fields and labels. A good reminder or starter to understand how these two play well together.
	Adrian Roselli shows us how to easily configure &lt;select&gt; elements to look custom instead of choosing a library that does get accessibility or usability wrong.
	Kitty Giraudel shares how to build a navigation. Sounds boring? Well, we probably forget a lot of the things that went into this one in our daily work.

JavaScript

	Ever struggled to understand DOM Events and their options? Here’s DOMEvents.dev to help you understand it better with an interactive playground.
	Parvus is an accessible, open-source image lightbox with no dependencies.
	Adrian Roselli shows how to build sortable table columns in an inclusive and simple way.

CSS

	Max Böck had a chance to try out container queries and shares his findings, his struggles and combines them with a good real world example.
	This tutorial by Ahmad Shadeed provides nice solutions for how to put text over images so it’s still readable.
	The folks from Sentry built a dark mode for their app. Now they share their path of cleaning up, refactoring variables, then building a new design system and then reimplementing the styles into their components.
	Lea Verou has an easy solution to implement dark mode by using inverted lightness variables. This is especially useful if you’re building new projects or one that already makes use of the hsl() color mode.
	Callum Hart shares how to name and define variables that adapt to different contexts like Chameleons do.
	Stephanie Eckles shares the updates to CSS that improve accessibility. She explains them so we understand better when and how to use them.
	Matsuko from craft cms shares how to create custom focus indicators that look great in CSS.
	Scott Kellum on why he thinks intrinsic typography is the future of styling text on the web. With detailed comparison-view examples and code suggestions he wrote a great article that’s useful for us developers.
	Stephanie Eckles explains all the modern CSS pseudo-class selectors like :any-link, :where() and others.
	Chris Coyier tried out the new CSS color-contrast() function that’s in the Safari preview. A pretty cool function when we’re working with variables and in different contexts.

Work &amp; Life

	Leo Babauta is great at pointing out things that we all know if we think about it but we constantly forget to think about. Here’s advice for the feeling of guilt to not working more when we’re done for the day already. A habit worth integrating into our lifestyles.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

Welcome to another new year, 2021. WDRL is now seven and a half year old already and the first edition had about twenty email subscribers. What was in there? We had webfont loading behaviour, Speedcurve, a HTML validator, GrumpIcon which created PNG fallbacks for SVG icons via Grunt (remember?), and we moved away from jQuery and started using native JS functions instead. This throwback was quite interesting for me this week. Some topics are still relevant today while others have completely disappeared or solved.
Coming 2021 we now get the ability to slowly replace old hacky code for aspect-ratio with Chrome supporting it now in the latest stable (88), Firefox as well behind flags and in Safari Tech Preview. But we still heavily need CanIUse as project to lookup browser compatibility — thanks so much for building it, Fyrd!
Not every new year needs new habits, new spectacular projects. It’s enough to realign our minds, our goals, our perspectives. It’s a good time to reconsider active or stale projects, clean up old stuff, declutter or start one new thing.
I’m personally dedicating a lot of time currently into my Market Gardening business as well as playing with my son in spare time. Besides that, I started organizing my web development business and declutter it. There’s no time to hold on to projects that aren’t in active development or I don’t like anymore but also don’t bring me joy or money.  
I’m also actively looking for small website projects currently so if you know something or need someone building a small company/project website, email me.
If you know about an environmental, social or humanity project that needs my help and could hire me (reduced rate possible) for a limited time, connect me.
I wish you all the best, health and joy.
News

	Chrome 88 is out and brings CSS aspect-ratio to all users, it defaults target=&quot;_blank&quot; to treat as rel=&quot;no-opener&quot; always by default (which is now the web standard).

Generic

	The Sustainable Web Manifesto is a statement we can all sign to make the web less of a CO2 polluter and more sustainable, in all regards.

UI/UX

	Oliver Schöndorfer shares how to choose a typeface for apps and UIs. It’s a great read that shows the difference between normal, good and excellent app design. He also has a new YouTube channel for Better Type.

Tooling

	Integrating Stripe can be quite a complex task and switching between documentation and code editor can be annoying. So Stripe now has a VS Code extension that brings the Stripe environment into your code editor and makes this task so much more comfortable.

JavaScript

	Addy Osmani wrote another insightful guide how to import code on interaction to save traffic and improve performance on web apps. It’s definitely the gold standard of blog articles, and probably gold standard for web apps, if you implement this.
	Mathias Schäfer with a new article on maintaining javascript applications in the long term, describing the approach for an app built in 2014. Describing why they still use Backbone.js instead of their agency standard React, how they moved from CoffeeScript to TypeScript, handle documentation and maintain a test suite, Mathias concludes why abstractions may bite you in future.

CSS

	Bramus Van Damme shares that we can nest Media Queries. Interesting that most of us have never heard about it.
	Melanie Richards writes how we can integrate sticky elements into CSS Grid layouts without many hacks or side-effects.

Go beyond…

	Exxon, the oil company, knows its carbon future and keeps the data from view. They know that they’re one of the biggest polluters in the world, yet they’re not ready to change something. But given our business and economical system, can we judge them? At least not fully, simply stepping out of the business would make them bankrupt. So it remains an interesting, challenging issue of our generation to solve the economical and ecological problems of this industry so save our society.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

It’s nearly the end of the year and the world is still different than we could imagine before 2020. We still don’t know how to deal with the new kinds of diseases short and long-term. We still have no real clue and conclusion how to save our planet (means us humans, the planet will survive). Many of us now are in a state of uncertainty, of frustration, of stress. Working remotely isn’t easy for all of us, the split between childcare and work is hard,  and our social contacts have been reduced to the minimum. That’s definitely not a combination that makes our lives easy, calm and ourselves happy. That’s why I found this writing so useful: News is the last thing we need right now but it’s addictive like a drug. Reading this made me finally block all the major news sites. I’m already two weeks in, and it feels quite good. And fear not, it’s not that I don’t know about the important news, there are still enough ways to get them from other people. It’s simply that you don’t fetch them actively and don’t fall into the trap of getting caught by another handful of articles. 
I hope you all can enjoy the end of the year, make it a calm and nice time despite of all the things happening all over the world, despite all the articles here, all the news around us and all the other people sharing their fears, their concerns and annoyances with us. Let’s try to reframe it, show empathy, listen to people and try to understand them. Read you in 2021 again, thanks for everything to you, your support, your money gifts, your article suggestions, your conversations via email. I’m really grateful for this audience.
Generic

	Eric Bailey on how we can create more eco-friendly websites. Some pretty handy tricks in there, some very simple ones, some that can’t be applied to every project.
	AVIF, the file format based on the AV1 video codec, is the latest addition to the next-gen image formats. Now this article shares a couple of things we should know before we blindly use this new format for everything. WebP, for example, performs better for thumbnails, and if the picture has a high entropy, JPEG can still deliver better results at a smaller size. Funnily, JPEG2000 which never kicked off really still challenges most of the other formats today. And if you’re now unsure what to do, using mozJPEG is still one of the best compromises you can use today.

UI/UX

	Adam Silver shares why we should be more careful designing tab styles for use cases that aren’t or shouldn’t be tabs.
	Scale is a nice set of illustrations for free, even for commercial projects. The nice thing? You can set the main color easily in the SVG and adapt them to your brand color.

Tooling

	Blurhash is a nice library that creates blurs for image placeholders. Now here’s alos a pure PHP implementation of it.
	Plaiceholder is a simple online tool where you can upload an image and get a CSS, SVG, Base64, Blurhash, or React element that acts as blur placeholder until the real image is loaded. A nice tool for when you just need this a once or a couple of times.

Web Performance

	Kilian Valkhof shares concepts and examples of how we can integrate the prefers-reduced-data setting into our websites. With it, we can disable web font loading, not load background images, or using picture and its media query attribute to load smaller images than normal. We can even prevent preloading or autoplay of videos, disable infinite scrolling preloads (we could improve the example using IntersectionObserver). It’s super cool to see these practical implementations which don’t even require much effort but have a huge benefit to users with a limited data budget (international roaming, etc).
	James Ross shares how we can use Cloudflare Workers and CSS to deliver new image formats like AVIF. It’s pretty cool that James has some real use cases here and even shows the real life impact data.
	Noam Rosenthal on how they made their Wikipedia page previews fast. A nice insight into JavaScript’s heavy functions and how to easily or not replace them.

HTML &amp; SVG

	Robin Rendle explores what we can do with the &lt;details&gt;/&lt;summary&gt; elements in HTML and CSS. Ever thought that we could de-animate (pause) a gif? We can do inline-block footnotes or build tooltips with it!

JavaScript

	Jeremy Keith created a simple gist to save form input via localStorage to avoid content being lost when something happens to the client browser or the server resets the connection due to security.

CSS

	Ever tried to build a visual calendar with CSS? You may end up with tables and styling a lot of things. What’s much simpler is now that we have CSS Grid using this cool technology to build a basic calendar in three lines of CSS.
	If you want to have a clickable card interface, things can easily get tricky due to the fact that we can’t nest links in HTML. Christian Heilmann shares a way how to do it the right way but always keep in mind that UX and accessibility may still be impacted by this design pattern which is why nested links aren’t a native thing in HTML.
	Bramus Van Damme writes how to use the new aspect-ratio CSS property in browsers to replace these ugly padding-top hacks we used to apply to iframe embeds. Unfortunately, this is not baked into stable browsers yet but we can already use the setting and later strip the fallbacks from the codebase.

Go beyond…

	It makes me really happy to see such an amazing project: Field Notes: Snowmaker. A story how to make 99999 unique snow flakes. My dream? Brendan (or someone else) is allowed and paid for drawing all these snow flakes by hand. Nature is amazing, craft is amazing and we should embrace it. Thanks Field Notes for doing this project.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

Now there we go with a new writing. For me, this year has been quite different so far. And no, this is mostly not about some virus spreading across the world but about changing a lot in my work and personal life. My son keeps teaching me new skills, patience, happiness. My gardening project went well the first year and we’re scaling it next year so we can grow vegetables for more than 70 people. Not to stop here, we created a network for workshops and events where local people share their knowledge to improve farming, gardening and live a more resilient and sustainable life as humans.
On the other hand, being away from client work for half a year was incredibly useful. I now have a different view on some projects again, I refocused on what’s important in projects and got away from just coding and first ask about the goals, about how to achieve them before starting to dive into code. It was one part that I was missing in my job lately but didn’t realize. By talking to other people out there from a huge variety of professional backgrounds instead of constantly living in the bubble of web developers, I gained a different view of looking at and using websites, of how technology is used and how important (or sometimes unimportant) technology is for people.
On a last note, I’m currently available for a small frontend/fullstack project so if you know something or need someone like me, talk to me. Bonus if it’s for a sustainable company, project or has a positive environmental impact.  
In full honesty, Gardening is lot of fun, often really hard work, but also not super well paid. And I think I’m not ready to drop web development entirely, it can be so much fun as well!
News

	Oh yes, two new Firefox versions are here, v82 and v83 and they bring us DevTool inspection of server-send events, the Media Session API, CSS ::file-selector-button (yay!), conic-gradient, WebRender, Pinch to zoom on desktop, and more.
	Safari 14 is here and brings Web Extensions, Webpage Translation, Performance improvements, interoperability and better standards and compatibility by improving Web Platform Test passes. Safari now has a privacy report that shows trackers and third party data issues on a webpage to users quite prominently, it brings WebP support, supports CSS image-orientation, :is(), :where() (resetting specificity for the selector to 0, wohoo). JavaScript gets BigInt support and optional chaining via ?..

UI/UX

	Betsy Mikel shares how to write microcopy that improves the user experience even with a strategy how to analyze microcopy and how to collect feedback.

Tooling

	Upptime is an open source uptime and status page system, powered entirely by GitHub Actions and Issues. Cool!

Security

	Crowdsec is an open-source, lightweight service (written in Go) to detect and respond to bad behaviours and uses a global community-wide IP reputation database. Heard of fail2ban? This is a more modern approach of the service.

Web Performance

	Postgres doesn’t stop to surprise me (positively). James Coleman shares some tips on how to save space nearly for free by using a custom Ruby gem.

HTML &amp; SVG

	Tomek Sułkowski gave us a nice tip in a tweet: Using autocomplete=&quot;one-time-code&quot; in a form field will auto-fill an 2-FA code from messages or other apps in some browsers like Safari. This is such a nice UX and so simple to build in.

Accessibility

	Here’s Atkinson, a new free and hyperlegible font published by the Braille institute.
	Nataly Birch on email design accessibility best practices with a good few handful of tips what we can do better in emails and why we and our users benefit from it.

JavaScript

	Philip Walton shares how to build a back/forward (“bfcache” cache for nearly instant loading of pages when a user uses the browser history buttons. To be honest, I didn’t know this exists until I read the article and it’s super interesting. It’s basically a different cache layer that keeps a live capture of the page including the JavaScript heap in a separate cache. But due to this, it’s not always easy to handle, especially if you have events running on the page so this article contains the answers how to observe the bfcache and add handlers to it. In summary it’s a super powerful feature that’s incredibly useful for web apps but a normal website doesn’t need this layer of complexity.
	This date picker is very nice, flexible, pretty universal and accessible. I know there are many others out there but it’s one that’s working well, working with many coding platforms and is well usable by people.
	Nice, Apple now lets us integrate Face ID and Touch ID on the web, building it on top of the Web Authentication API. Imagine how this can improve the logging in experience for a good part of your user base.
	Chris Coyier shares how we can integrate the Web Share API into our websites instead of these ugly lists of social icons. Note that this depends on us how well it’s perceived and working. For example on macOS it’s supported but most apps on the Mac don’t integrate the Framework for it so they don’t show up in the list of sharing services. We should take care that our products support the native frameworks to make the web a better place.
	Wonder which operator to use in JavaScript for a comparison? Or seen a code snippet and felt weird because you didn’t know what operator this was? Josh W Comeau has built an operator lookup.

CSS

	Stefan Judis shares a nice approach of centering a container with sub-elements like a navigation with the fit-content property in CSS. Unfortunately, this still needs vendor prefixes at the moment to work in major browsers.
	Ahmad Shadeed explains the CSS Grid minmax() function with some really good examples. Most tutorials explaining this function are very generic and not practical so this was a nice read when I found it. In case you don’t fully understand the minmax syntax yet, give it a read.
	If you use Tailwind CSS or consider to use it, this amazing post on color theming is for you. But also if you don’t use Tailwind there’s at least a good part of the article that we can learn something from in terms of setting colors in CSS.
	Josh W. Cameau has a CSS Grid full-bleed layout tutorial that’s pretty complete and includes lots of nice throwbacks into the history of the web.
	CSS Text effects are rarely useful but sometimes for big teaser headlines it’s what we need. And if we need them, it’s sometimes not so easy to create a nice and really good effect so this article showing five CSS Text effects is great and includes split colored text, video text, and image background text.
	There are a lot of basic tutorials on CSS Variables but this one contains some pretty handy use cases for variables that go beyond the basic color variable usage but show how we can build a flexible avatar box, defining paddings or gaps by using calc() and variables together.
	Talking about colors in CSS, we have Josh Bader sharing how we can use CSS variables calc() and rgb() to enforce high contrast colors in our CSS design system.
	Rachel Andrew shares how we can build a Masonry layout fully in CSS with CSS Grid Level 3.
	Dave Rupert explores how we should define semantic variable names in the age of light and dark themes.

Work &amp; Life

	Engineering Manager is one of the roles that most people don’t know exactly what it’s about and what these people do. That’s why I found Karl Hughes’ »A day in the life of an Engineering Manager« a really nice one to read. He explains what he does all day and it turns out it’s a role full of soft skills like networking, explaining things or translating between two people, between company departments and to raise awareness around delivery, around process management and recruiting as well as people’s happiness in their jobs. I was Engineering Manager for quite some time as well so I can second what Karl writes here.

Go beyond…

	You know what scares me most when it comes to climate change and how we as humans perceive it? That we don’t notice that our climate is changing slowly but steadily. Every time a big tornado or wildfires destroy lots of things, our habitats, we read dozens of articles in the news, watch it in TV. But we barely notice that the climate already changed for everyone in the world, that temperatures grew already, that the four seasons changed a little bit, that we face more and more inconsistencies in the weather, more things like wildfires.  I’m not sure if it’s the protection mode in our brains that blocks this away or if it’s just too hard to notice these tiny events when so much other stuff is going on in our lives.
	Who is responsible for climate change? The complexity of the problem makes a simple answer elusive. And yet, responsibility matters—not just for assigning blame, but for finding strategic levers for future change. Here’s insight, here’s evidence, here’s a good article to help us understand our biggest problem of humanity yet a bit better. And remember that most plastic is made out of oil.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,


“You can run-away, run-away, run-away… you gotta face this… time is running fast…” — Snoop Lion in his song ‘Rebel Way’

We can apply this quote to a lot of matters in our lives right now. Our time to do something for ourselves, for our relatives, our animals, our planet is running fast. And whether it’s about voting, about the actions to fight a pendemic or to fight to get back our human rights and freedom in face of country lock-downs, or in the fight against global warming which is getting harder each year we don’t do enough.
Have we considered the impact of our current system to develop, deploy, test and run our Internet services on the planet? How much energy is used to create all these Docker images, to run all the VMs and hardware machines that are just there to run Continuous Integration systems and get rebuilt from scratch each time we push a little piece of code? Now considering that no provider is yet powering their server clusters completely CO2 neutral, not event trying to count the energy and sources we need to build all the hardware in there, this suddenly shines in a not so bright light. At the same time we destroy the biggest value we have as humans: Our soil. By using farming techniques, chemicals that destroy the soil long-term and building more and more houses and business units on the soil, we destroy our ability to produce food that keeps us living. And then we face a pandemic and wonder why… it’s time to act. Not just to watch another video stream. To reduce our impact, to reduce our energy consumption, our car drives, our use of chemicals that hurt ourselves. And instead, we should focus on what’s doing good to us… nature, calmness, friendship, love, kindness.
News

	Postgres 13 was released and brings performance benefits, application development conveniences such as native UUIDv4 generation, or datetime() support in the JSON path. Here’s an in-depth review including code how to use the new things in v13.

Generic

	Steve Messer explains us why his website is killing the planet — or is it really? We can do something.

UI/UX

	Chris Coyier shows us how to offer options for mailto: and tel: links in a custom popup modal.
	System UIcons is a set of icons under Unlicense so you can use without attribution for free (but it’s even cooler if you add an attribution).

Tooling

	umami is a simple self-hosted open web analytics platform.

Security

	terjanq provides us with a collection of short XSS payloads that can be used in different contexts. Pretty cool to do some security testing on our applications.

Privacy

	The browser Chrome is changing the default Referrer-Policy and is now using strict-origin-when-cross-origin by default. That will be for the benefit of the users’ privacy. Of course, if you want to enable another type of policy, you can still do.

Web Performance

	Infinite scrolling is used a lot across the web, especially for item listings. Now the key for this cool way to ease a flow for the user is to implement this right and without layout shift or other glitches. Addy Osmani shows how to avoid layout shifts in infinite scolling. And don’t forget to update the URL to the next paging so if something goes wrong and the user needs to reload the page, they see the same state again.
	AVIF is the new hot image format that we can use on the web. Finally, it’s a standard format that’s going to be implemented by probably all browsers quite quickly. Chrome already has support on Desktop and it’s coming to Android soon, Firefox is currently implementing it and Apple is part of the AV1 working group so they’ll probably add it as well soon. Anyway, you can already use the new image format by using the picture element and content negotiation methods as we do it for WebP or other formats already. But why AVIF? Well, it’s a standard that is accepted by many major software companies and it’s really good in compressing images while still looking good. In many cases it’s much better than WebP, and it’s really good for not only photos but also illustrations.

Accessibility

	Microsoft had it for years already as proprietary solution on their platform, now Mozilla added support for the standard Media Query prefers-contrast in Firefox. This means that some colors are enforced by the browser to ensure better contrast and now we can serve high contrast modes of our websites to more users.
	Dave Rupert appeals for writing alt attribute values like paragraphs so in case of an image loading failure or a screen reader, the user still gets a really good description of what’s to be seen here. This is good, I do this a lot already but one thing to say is that it’s still an attribute so we can’t really write more than one paragraph there. Alternatively, you can still use figure and figcaption elements for this use case and just leave the img element’s alt attribute empty. Never omit the attribute, please, by the way.

JavaScript

	inclusive-dates is a really well made human-friendly datepicker that’s also fully accessible.

CSS

	Ana Tudor shows the future of CSS masonry solutions with CSS Grid. But as support is very limited and yet to be implemented by many browsers, we need a fallback which Ana shows as well in the tutorial.
	Wonder how to make a gradient colored text nowadays? Serving it as an image or SVG isn’t necessary, Adam Argyle shows us in a Codepen how it can be solved using background-clip and other CSS properties.
	While we all use box-shadow a lot, the lesser known drop-shadow property is a really cool one: it creates a shadow around the element’s clippings instead of their box-model. Maybe you remember how to create triangles with just some  borders. Using drop-shadow let’s us define a shadow on such elements.
	Adam Argyle and Oriol Brufau share how to make custom bullets in a HTML list using the CSS ::marker pseudo-element selectors. This is good because it’s standardizing things we used to hack since years.
	Stephanie Eckles with a new great tutorial how to apply a custom look to native HTML input fields with the latest methods.
	Linearly scale font-size with CSS clamp() based on the viewport. The solution we looked for since a long time is now available in browsers.
	Ahmad Shadeed explains the mindset we should use when coding CSS: Just in case.

Work &amp; Life

	Caring about the climate but don’t find things to help? Climatebase is a platform that offers events and jobs to find in the fight against climate change.
	Matthias Ott with some simple, honest words on why the change of climate affects us, directly.

Go beyond…

	You remember I posted a link to a website that’s entirely powered by Solar? Here’s the follow-up that shares how sustainable the project is. Well, crazy how unsustainable technology most of the time is, right?
	Nigeria′s Bayo Akomolafe: “We aren′t ′in control′ of climate crisis” This interesting read gives us some insight into other cultures and how we could treat our nature and living environment differently to how we’re used to do right now.
	Why soil matters. A good summary of why we should take more care on the soil we live on, we live from. I myself am going to hold workshops and talks beginning next year here in southern Germany about solutions how to take care of soil, how to restore it, preserve it and bind CO2 in the atmosphere in the soil.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

Wow, time flies and I realise that I not only negelected this newsletter for a long time but since I started the draft for this edition, nearly two months of life happened. I’ll have to see how often I can write this again but the goal is to just publish it when I write the draft and not let it wait in the queue for such a long time. If you want to know what happened recently in my life, at least a part of it can be seen here and there are some notes on my Garden (in German only for now). My own blog has been neglected as well but maybe I’ll find more time over the next weeks to give back some life to it. Now over to this weeks topic:
It’s our money that rules the world. We together still own more money than anyone else on the planet. What we spend our money on is going to shape the direction where we as society go. We influence whether there will be a war, how many cars are produced, how many pesticides are sprayed across our planet, how many trees in the rainforests are cut, how many planes are polluting  the air we breathe. Every single cent is spent either to a good cause or a bad cause and if we’d bear that in mind every day, we probably would change our shopping behaviour.
We can opt for renewable energy in our homes, at the workplace, we can buy natural, organic, non processed food. We don’t need to buy a new iPhone every year, a new car every two or five years, we don’t need to fly to far away destinations just for vacation. We don’t need to buy cheap meat, plastics, a pair of Jeans manufactured by poor children who breath chemicals and colors every day because of what we buy.
We’re a small dot in evolution but we can change where we are on the line. More importantly, we, and only we or maximum our children will decide whether the line continues or whether humans go extinct. Like dinosaurs in the past.
Generic

	The Climate Strike Github organisation created an open source license we can use which prevents oil and gas companies from co-opting our hard work to extracting more fossil fuels.

UI/UX

	Ahmad Shadeed on how to align a logo image correctly in layouts.

Security

	iOS 14 will bring App-Bound Domains to WKWebView, a new mechanism that will offer better privacy for users in an app’s web view. Until now, the app could monitor any user activity in a web view; with the new App-Bound domain concept that won’t be the case anymore. That comes with the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) being enabled in WKWebView starting with iOS14 as well.
	Did you know that you can capture CSP violation events in the browser with JavaScript? The SecurityPolicyViolationEvent does this and tells you all the details we want to know about such an issue. With that, we can easily build a simple reporting tool for our services.

Privacy

	“Being a Facebook-Free Business means your customers can trust that you aren’t collaborators with the Facebook machine. That when you spend your money with a Facebook-Free Business, none of that money will find its way back to Facebook’s coffers.”—DHH in Become A Facebook-Free Business. I personally highly value companies that don’t spend money on Facebook (incl Insta, etc.) advertising.
	A good example of why one browser alone isn’t making a good ecosystem for us and only diversity, transparency can create a safer product for us users. Chrome’s marketplace was recently cleaned from browser extensions that were installed on 32million browser instances. The fatal thing here is that they didn’t serve the purpose they advertised but instead captured all the browser history and user activity and sent it to shady databases for spam, advertising and retargeting purposes. Better don’t install any extension even from a “trusted marketplace” like Google’s.

Accessibility

	Learn how to design beautiful and accessible link focus states in this tutorial by Ethan Marcotte.

JavaScript

	Ada Rose Cannon shares how we can animate DOM changes in JavaScript.
	If we want to look for a specific index in JavaScript we don’t need to use any complex loop with a stop anymore but instead can use Array.prototype.findIndex() which returns the index of the first match of our testing function.
	Wenson Hsieh shares how to use the Async Clipboard API and the differences and advantages over the methods we used in the past.
	iOS Safari 13.4+ allows us to block back and forward navigation gestures. This is very useful for media galleries and image croppers where users interact with elements on the side of the viewport and most likely don’t want to navigate to another page, as Rik Schennink explains.
	Fluor.js is a cool small library that lets us animate a lot of details on websites. Quite nice!

CSS

	Chris Coyier shares how we can use the new shiny CSS property aspect-ratio in our layouts and with that finally replace various hacks we used to use for over a decade now.
	Lea Verou with a guide on CSS Variables that handles the basic concepts and real practical use cases.
	Bram Van Damme shares how to use CSS Grid layout Level 2 to create a Masonry layout.
	Sara Soueidan on how she uses global and component style settings with CSS Custom Properties.

Work &amp; Life

	After a month of trial, the Buffer team now is moving entirely to a 4-day work week as the results of significantly reduced stress, higher autonomy, and higher work happiness, more motivation, better collaboration while productivity surprisingly didn’t suffer.
	Why it’s important to connect productivity with our purpose to make it essential and meaningful productivity. Because what doesn’t serve the mission is burning ourselves out which happens if we just strive for more productivity when it doesn’t serve our own deepest mission.
	Finally, there’s a resource to find ethical job sites for freelancers instead of ending up on sites that try to exploit us.
	Lucas Miller is neuroscientist and he sees Slack as a particularly “scary offender” in stopping people getting their work done because it encourages them to be constantly distracted. Of course that isn’t only about Slack but about all the messenger style chat systems we use — no matter if made by an independent company, Microsoft, Facebook or any other.

Go beyond…

	If we frame our own life a little bit different, in evolutionary context, everything we do, everything we see as given or as inherited by our parents can be seen a bit different. We’re then only a small dot in evolution and yet, we are the only ones who can still decide whether the human species will continue to be part of evolution on our planet or not. Evolution is a quite simple concept.
	Let’s try to understand why biodiversity is collapsing worldwide at the moment. It means that less species of animals are around in our ecosystem and climate change is fueling it while our agriculture is actively killing the living ground and plants these species need to live. Weirdly, we fail to understand that we won’t get any food, wood and other things that are vital to our health and ability to live if there is no biodiversity anymore. Technology won’t save us in that case, it can only help understand the issue and maybe help improve the situation but the major impact is how we act, what we buy and how we farm.
	We are facing one of the biggest decisions of humankind — a decision on how to face the climate crisis. This is a huge responsibility and at the same time an opportunity. Our chance to work together to initiate a comprehensive change towards a more just society. Here’s the Grassroots Climate Plan with a solid plan what we need and can do to change the current state of burning down our own habitat.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

Hello my fellow readers! After months of silence I’m back. Since my last update in February a lot has changed, not only in my life but in everyones’. A virus makes us living differently than we are  used to and work has changed with it. A lot of people work from home these days, others lost their jobs and many are facing a change of rules in any part of life. Kids can’t go to school, vacation is not allowed for a specific time or in other cases is enforced to use during the calm times.
For myself, my life changed quite a bit in March and April. I started with a new field to grow vegetables nearby in March and it keeps me busy for most of the week right now. It’s a CSA and we can already give ten families including our own nearly enough vegetables for the week with the amount growing every week. In April, my son was born, right in the middle of a weird time that enabled us to welcome him calm and easy to our world.
The Web… where to start? For me, now just watching from outside as I laid down all my jobs during the past months to enjoy family time and do the garden, it felt weird to read about all the technological changes during a virus that changes the lives of many people. On the other hand, life goes on, work goes on, and it’s great to see that some people continue to build amazing things, to make better browsers, to invent technologies and services that help all the other people out there struggling right now.
Our own species to me remains a mystery: While during the crisis and lockdowns, we achieved to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, this quickly goes back or even worse since we “recover” from the lockdowns. I lost my hope that people will fly less now for private and business purposes and may rethink their lives and get on a more sustainable track. I read a lot about how to prevent getting sick, how to stay sane during this heavy, exhausting times and it’s all about your inner peace, about health and about happiness. Many solutions how to achieve it are going outside right where you are, meditate, get rid of stuff you don’t use or need. Most people in my country know less about cities and villages or areas in their own country than in Italy or France or even more abroad. Why is it still not cool to go on vacation in your own country or neighbour country? It takes you only 1 – 3 hours by train instead of a flight that takes 16 hours just to enjoy another beach that’s no different to what you could visit also with a 2 – 3 hours flight. We all watch nature and outdoor adventure documentaries on Netflix but we don’t do it ourselves. I’ve never been truly happier at work than in the past months being outdoors on my field every day, no matter which weather. My back does not hurt anymore, I’m less stressed out and overall way happier. I don’t earn a lot of money right now and we all know that earning money with growing  vegetables by hand and with love doesn’t pay a lot of bills. But I decided now that it just needs to pay my bills. I’ll continue to be a freelance developer to earn a baseline of money but splitting my work into two jobs was by far the best I could do for myself lately.
As always, my thoughts are thought as a trigger to you. Disregard it if you don’t want to think about it or don’t have the time right now. Reply to me if you think you want to say something or have a question. Share it, if you think you know someone who would benefit from it or write your own thoughts to the public if you think they’ll benefit others.
News

	Uhm, so there’s Firefox 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77 out since my last update. The most important news are: Better WebRTC privacy protections, faster search bar, locally cached trusted Web PKI Certificate Authority certificates, support for the loading attribute on img elements, Picture-in-picture support, Audio Worklet support, and support for the JavaScript API String.prototype.replaceAll().
	WebKit in the meanwhile introduced Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking to improve privacy for users. Quite a big change although we could see it coming.
	Chrome 80, 81, 83 now supports Module Workers, optional chaining in JavaScript, trusted types, new default form styles, support for the native file system API, and new cross-origin policies.
	Safari 13.1 adds support for the Web Animation API, Async Clipboard API, JavaScript replaceAll, nullish coalesing operator, ResizeObserver, the enterkeyhint attribute for form inputs, Picture-in-Picture API, and the RemotePlayback API.

Generic

	José Manrique López de la Fuente on Ethics and Open Source Software Development. The plea for an ethical license for copyleft comes up again.

UI/UX

	Alex Holachek shares her experiences on how to make form inputs better for mobile users by choosing the right input types, attributes, validators.
	“It is not uncommon that I raise an accessibility or usability issue with a client’s design or implementation and am met with either ‘But Google does this,’ or ‘But Apple does this.’” Adrian Roselli in a revealing, open statement on why we really shouldn’t care about what the big companies do because they don’t know either.

Tooling

	Tobias Tom shares how to use bash operators effectively and shows that there’s more than just the &amp;&amp; operator.

Security

	deSEC is a free and secure DNS hosting running on open source software and sounds pretty cool. It even has an anycast so it’s fast around the world while offering more security than most other services that you pay for.

Web Performance

	Tim Kadlec on building web solutions with friction and why he loves the concept of Bundlephobia, a tool that warns you about your JavaScript bundle size.
	Danny van Kooten is the author of a very common Wordpress plugin. He made some simple changes and with it saved probably about 59000kg of CO2, all by removing a 20kb JavaScript dependency. There’s little chance you can similarly easy cut your personal emissions so this gives us a clue how important it is to not be careless about what we do on the web.
	How fast is PHP 8 going to be? Although there are only prereleases available yet, it’s probably a lot faster than version 7.

Accessibility

	Here are the Standards for Writing Code Accessibly.

JavaScript

	Arrays, arrays, arrays, one of the most common things we use in programming languages. Here’s Rebecca Uranga explaining the most common modern JavaScript Array methods and when to use which one.
	Arrow functions are handy but they’re also not very great when we need to debug them. But Dmitri Pavlutin shares how to write better arrow functions.

CSS

	Jhey Tompkins shows us how we can create a responsive CSS Motion Path.
	Diagonal layouts are pretty common in the past years, but they often were hacked together quite ugly to achieve the look. However, in 2020 we can do it quite nicely with modern CSS techniques and Nils Binder shares how.
	Sometimes the specification is the best documentation. Inside the CSS Values and Units Module Level 4 you can learn about the min(), max() but more importantly about the clamp() function in CSS that allows you to e.g. force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px by stating: font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px); All we ever wanted for fonts, right?
	Oh, what if we could style form inputs nicely and with simple CSS? Aaron Iker shares how we can do it.

Work &amp; Life

	This news made me very unhappy. It’s one of the main reasons I chose to change my profession, to do something actively against climate change, to become a climate farmer: “One in five children have had nightmares about climate change while more than half do not think they are being listened to on the subject, a survey has found”. It’s upon us, parents, uncles/aunts, and friends of parents to fix this problem, so that these kids don’t need to suffer from bad dreams.
	Leo Babauta on the heartbreaking effects of being only partly committed to most things.
	“When you bought your first smartphone, did you know you would spend more than 1,000 hours a year looking at it? […] If we wasted money the way we waste time, we’d all be bankrupt.” — Seth Godin

Go beyond…

	Ericsson gives us a “quick guide” to our digital carbon footprint that shows our impact of using all the online services. And while the subtitle says it’s little, it also reveals that there’s potential to reduce the impact by 80 percent if providers would use greener energy and infrastructure.
	So who would think about farming when we’re talking about air quality and clean air? Well, it seems that California’s regulations help farms produce more food since the trees’ photosynthesis is more efficient when there’s less ground ozone.
	How does climate change impact Europe? Because common news mostly include other areas in the world, we know little about it. But this great interactive maps model shows the change of weather in a simple way. Heavy rains, forest fires, agricultural issues, draughts will all become more serious and more frequent, it seems.
	As a company you can stand up and protect your clients, you can be political. See the example of Basecamp who now deny to offer their products to employee-surveillance products and services.


Thank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better. The next edition will hopefully be served to your inboxes way sooner again and I already have a couple of thoughts and links in the queue.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

There’s so much potential in all of us. There’s so much distraction in our lives today. We tend to continue doing not something different because we have too much on our plates, we are too distracted. We don’t have time to focus on what we really want to do, focus on what we want to change, focus on helping other people or focus on self-care.
In 2020 I opened a Community Supported Agriculture to provide local, naturally grown and healthy food to people nearby. No need for them to buy it in the supermarket where it was transported many hundred kilometers through the country and isn’t fresh anymore. My action to foster local community, to do something for the better, for the climate, for other people with a real impact.
I will also take three months of parental leave time for my family (my wife and soon my newborn child) and for myself, to get focus on the things that are in my mind but never find time to think properly about. This means no work, no WDRL, no other developer related stuff during that time so an entirely different lifestyle for a limited time. Let’s see what this brings.
News

	PHP 7.4 is the latest version but v8 is in the works and Brent shares what’s new in PHP 8: We’ll likely get Union types, a Just in time compiler, a static return type, weak maps, ::class on objects as easier form of writing get_class(), it lets us create DateTime objects from an interface, and some more. What’s changing?  Concatenation precedence, error reporting types, and error silencing via @ suppression.

Generic

	Hugo Giraudel shares the path of how they transformed a very MVP app into a great, modern web app that’s scalable, fast and accessible: Lessons from building N26 for the web.
	The Architecture of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine, circa 2019. A deep dive into Microservices, Kubernetes and more. Real time indexing with Kafka, Cassandra; Deployments with Ansible, Salt and Terraform. A lot and this is still just a snapshot of a fast changing ecosystem.

UI/UX

	Jonathon Colman analyzed mobile app designs and 36% is the right amount of text in mobile apps. An interesting design journey through countless apps that shows the importance of text in design.

Tooling

	Now this site is incredibly useful for configuring PostgreSQL as it’s a complete config guide written for humans.
	SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. What’s that? A tool that integrates with every data source available and analyses them, making that data easy to navigate in a UI.

Accessibility

	Marcus Herrmann shows us how to build accessible routing in Vue.js.

JavaScript

	This is &lt;progressive-image&gt;,  a custom element that progressively enhances image placeholders once they are in the viewport, made by André Ruffert. It lazy loads, has a dave data option, produces no reflow, and has no dependencies.
	Philip Walton shares how we can serve way smaller HTML payloads in applications by using Service Workers for them.

CSS

	It’s interesting to see where we started with CSS over twenty years ago and where we are now. I myself built my first website in 2001 with Framesets and inline CSS and HTML 4 style attributes. Quickly after, I learned a bit how to use tables to create layouts (Photoshop could write most of the code, huh!) but gladly this didn’t take long until we had CSS2.1 which allowed us to create way better and more semantic layouts.

Work &amp; Life

	Enough is enough. But what’s enough? Having less stuff (aka “minimalism”) can’t be successful for us long-term, it can only serve as a path to sufficiency and satisfaction. The goal needs to be that we solve enough for us, that we realize and incorporate that we don’t need more, that we have enough.
	Frank Chimero with a list of things that foster burnout: Our achievement culture, hyperactive comparison, isolation, the lack of work ethics, unnecessary self-improvement thoughts, and a couple more. It’s the first step to identify these points and then take care that not too many in parallel are true for our lives.
	A new guide &#039;With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility&#039; arrives during a period of backlash on campuses, where tech companies like Amazon and Palantir recruit. It’s by Mozilla and it wants young people to consider ‘Ethical Issues’ before taking jobs in tech. It’s on healthy work places, healthy company and startup culture, working on real problems in the world and not causing any harm with our work we do.

Go beyond…

	How your clothes become microfibre pollution in the sea. We buy plastic fibre clothes, wash them and the plastic is slowly dissolving into microplastic in the washing mashine and the sewage treatment plants can’t filter it so it gets into the rivers which end up in the sea.
	Paris, France, 2020: The mayor announces that they plan to make the city fully cyclist friendly in the next four years. But what does it mean and how will the city change? It’s a great plan that ensures cycling is )the most efficient way to navigate from A to B.
	Simon Weckert is an artist and he has a fun project where he hacks Google’s traffic jam algorithm by walking on empty streets with a dozen phones using Google Maps directions. The result? More empty streets because Google reroutes other cars to avoid the jam.
	The open climate science group has analyzed the past 2k years and this shows the development of global temperature in a visual way between year 1 and 2019 AD. It’s super interesting to see that how unusual the current period of the past 150–200 years is in terms of our planet’s climate. See, humans exists since way longer than 1AD so this visualization also shows us where the solution to fix climate change would be. We have to look back and adapt our lifestyle a bit. Local, following the year rythm, slower, and happier.


Finally, let me recommend you the printed books of Cabins that are simple and serve the one purpose we all strive for: A space that spellbind us in its warmth and ingenious simplicity.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

First I wish all a great, healthy and stressles new year, and hope many of you had a bit of a calmer time over the last weeks.
In a company, culture is key to success. But how do we get to a good culture? Most importantly, we need to keep in mind that culture is not a top down approach. Anyone in a company is part of it and needs to foster it. As always, there will be some people or a specific person in the company who is leading the efforts and ideally it’s one from HR or the director itself. But what we can see in bigger companies that there are many subcultures in the various departments and teams and it all depends on these individual groups whether they spend energy on creating a communication culture, talk about work ethics or not. In the end, work for most of us happens during the most prominent 8 hours of the day—the daylight hours. Why would we spend it on a place with a bad culture? Better spend some energy on creating a healthy, warm and friendly atmosphere where we love to go to each day.
News

	Chrome will change how they ask for notification permissions to protect the users from these annoying requests. The downside of course is that legit requests are harder to find for the user. Lead by example and only use these types of requests when necessary and initiated by the user.
	Firefox 72 is out and brings enhanced tracking protection for everyone, Shadow Parts CSS in ShadowDOM, Motion Path animations, Nullish coalescing operator (??) in JavaScript, and Picture in Picture for macOS and Linux.
	Safari 13 is out for already a while now but we haven’t seen a complete roundup of what’s new in there yet. Here’s the Webkit teams’ article about all the news, including Desktop-class Browsing on iPad, Pointer Events finally, the visual viewport API, programmatic paste, accelerated scrolling on iOS and iPadOS, support for FIDO2-compliant USB security keys, Apple Pay in WKWebView, Dark Mode support, Safari WebDriver for iOS, and more.
	The new Microsoft Edge is out (v79) and it’s the first official Chromium based release. This means a lot, especially as it’s available not only for the latest but also for Windows 7 so it’ll be a big boost for the modern web.

Tooling

	Understand how prometheus works as a beginner. What is it? It’s an open source metrics and analysis collector service and pretty cool because it’s so flexible that you can use it for server statistics, collecting platform metrics or user data.

Security

	Using Avast products? Here’s why it collects and sells your web habits. Maybe it’s time to reconsider a software switch?

Privacy

	Do you know what your car knows about you? Ever considered how much data it collects and who it can send it to? It’s crazy, and we usually know very little about the scope of this data.
	See, a profitable company can stop using third-party tracking services while still providing a very good product and making enough money to pay employees and even grow further. It’s a matter of the mindset, it’s a matter of will. The only problem I see here is that they say their title says they removed the last tracker but instead what they did is that they now use a custom analytics service that isn’t a third-party. However, I see business metrics combined with the very basic, anonymously collected user browsing behaviour on a website as way more powerful than having e.g. Google Analytics in place. The power of Business Intelligence tools is huge and lets us easily detect problems in our services, see which features are used and which ones are not. And many of them are easy to set up and don’t need a third-party involved—a Postgres/Timescale database and UI tool like Grafana often is enough.
	Since a year and a half we face cookie banners on every website. Many, even some of the biggest on the Internet (e.g. Tumblr) block the initial view and only let you proceed after accepting cookies and the privacy policy. It’s agreed that most websites don’t really put the banner on the page in an informed decision but to be safe. Most people neglect the user experience over being safe. But barely someone reflects and asks whether the cookies requiring the banner by law could be eliminated. This article summarizes the situation of cookie banners and how possible solutions could look like and why informed decisions are often better than decreasing conversion and sales due to unnecessary overlays and banners.

CSS

	This CSS only carousel by Christian Schäfer is a cool show of what simple HTML and CSS are capable of these days. The nice thing it’s even basic-accessible and could be extended easily via JavaScript for additional features.
	Litmus has tipps on how to code your emails to respect Dark Mode theme for your OS. As usual with email, support is very wild and inconsistent but this article explains what’s the best thing to do until the situation improves.

Work &amp; Life

	Basecamp shares their internal communication guidelines to the public and we can learn a lot for our own businesses or place of work.
	Adam Blanchard shares the fine line between micro- and macromanagement in companies and why the golden middle is key to a self-organising team.

Go beyond…

	Why don’t we look at some very beautiful and interesting photos from around the world that have been captured in 2019 to get inspired for the new year? When I looked at them, it was a short moment of calm, and my mind wandered into these moments.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

It’s the last update for this year as the new year holidays are coming up and I’m gonna take a break from web development as well during this time. Time to work on other things like woodwork, or preparing and planning the next year’s Gardening season. I’m going to build a CSA and next year will be the preparation and experimentation season before going into full production for other people so they can enjoy local, fresh and carefully grown food at a reasonable price.
The end of the year is typically the time where everyone asks about new year goals. Well, whether you have goals or not, we can definitely care more about how we treat other people, whether they’re co-workers, our managers or clients. If we show empathy and try to be helpful instead of arrogant, we not only build a better product but also build a network of trust, a network of reliable people that we can count on when we need help. In times where everything happens in virtual worlds, it’s more and more important to not be just any brand out there but one that stands out because they are personal and kind. If you have any feedback on how I can do better with this newsletter or Colloq, write me an email. And if you know great examples that stood out for you, let me know as well e.g. on Mastodon or Twitter.
News

	Chrome 79 is out and brings maskable icons on Android PWAs, the WebXR Device API, and an origin trial of a “Wake Lock API”. In the DevTools, you can now see why a cookie was blocked, emulate CSS media queries like prefers-reduced-motion or prefers-color-scheme.

Generic

	BPF: A New Type of Software. These are interesting softwares as they don’t show up as nomal processes or kernel modules. They introduce a new interface for applications to make kernel requests, alongside syscalls and is a super interesting change in how operating systems work with software.
	It seems that Jeff Bezos grandfather once said to him “one day you’ll understand that it’s harder to be kind than clever.” And this is very true, if you think about all the clever technologies and products out there. Most of them are not showing any sort of kindness to other people and we still have a hard time coming up with a list of companies that we would define as “kind” to us customers.
	Colin Bendell explores the world of “microbrowsers”, these little link preview widgets appearing in messaging services like Slack, Messages, Whatsapp, Signal and shows how we can optimise the content of the previews with simple tools.

Privacy

	These days it’s hard to prevent tracking. Even for the big players like the WebKit team, as they point out in their article Preventing Tracking Prevention Tracking.
	How small design changes rewrote the rules of messaging and how we feel about one another, says Adrian Zumbrunnen and shows us how this happened over the past two decades at the example of ICQ, one of the earliest instant messengers.

Web Performance

	Instant Page is a JavaScript that tries to predict really well whether a user will click on a link or not, and, based on that, will prefetch and preload the linked page in the browser for improved performance.

Accessibility

	Paul Grenier writes about how we can and why we should care more about writing good docs. Automating inclusive documentation shows tools and services helping us achieve that.

JavaScript

	Michelle Barker shares how we can easily animate and create beautiful scrolling experiences with a few lines of JavaScript combined with CSS Scroll Snap Points.
	Paul Irish has published a new mini library that provides a super fast YouTube embed for your page using custom elements.
	Erik Terwan wrote a small library that lets a page react to scroll changes called ScrollTrigger.

CSS

	Stas Melnikov shares how to use auto margin values in Flexbox layout.
	Holger Bartel shows us with a simple and practical example of why the new CSS :is() pseudo selector can be very handy and shorten our selector code massively.
	Bryan Robinson on how we can lay out full with content sections in an article layout using CSS Subgrid, something that we always needed ugly hacks for so far.

Work &amp; Life

	Structure does not bring you happiness is a piece of text on how important effectiveness and structure at work are. But keeping in mind that this won’t bring you happiness and adapting your work and lifestyle accordingly is even more important to being a happy person.

Go beyond…

	Aluminium is heavily used today almost in any sector of products. But it’s not problem-free and it’s amazing to see that Apple just bought the first batch of carbon-free aluminium. This makes hopes for less resource-heavy products soon.
	The world’s forests are being carved into pieces—but why is this a problem? Well, animals are likely to pay a heavy price, so we should try to reduce the fragmentation and combine forests again instead of splitting them up further.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

It’s interesting to reflect on our own behaviour: We can often enough catch ourselves complaining or ranting about other people—some of them we know personally, some we don’t. I’m currently reading a (German) book that’s written mostly for farmers but I can’t stop thinking it should be read by anyone, especially non-farmers. Of course it tackles our climate, but more importantly, it points out how we end up in the situation of fueling climate change. It reveals how our social behaviour is broken once we are not in direct contact with people anymore. It’s relatively easy for us to thank beloved ones or a craftsman showing up at your house to repair something, but it’s hard to show the same appreciation to those who grow our coffee, to those who make our shirts and jeans.
It’s hard for us to feel empathy with people in the news, with famous people while it’s easy to complain about them or be envious. But what if we try to show empathy? Maybe they grew into their role and don’t even like all the show business or attention from media. What if we try to see them as part of our society and while their influence may seem bigger than our own, it’s upon us to influence the world around us, not the media’s. We can choose whether to watch TV and do nothing but complain about how bad everything is or take some action, self-reflected, with our friends, neighbours, maybe with strangers who feel the same. 
It’s our choice whether we declutter our flat, whether to consume cheap meat, whether to be annoyed by the climate news, or whether we use our common sense and try to help other people, other animals, other plants, trees and in the end ourselves by showing gratitude, appreciation and creating a social, helpful community again. It doesn’t matter where it starts—it can be online, at work, with your clients, while shopping groceries, at home with your friends, children or neighbours.
News

	Firefox 71 is out and brings Picture in Picture playing mode, more CSS Grid Level 2 features, the column-span property, the JavaScript Promise.allSettled() method, a partial support for the Media Session API. The developer tools now include Network request blocking, a Console multi-line editor mode, network full-text search, a WebSocket message inspector, and logging on Event Listeners.
	PHP 7.4 has been released and brings typed properties, arrow functions, limited return type covariance and argument type contravariance, unpacking inside arrays, numeric literal separator, allows exceptions from __toString(), and removes some more extensions from the core.

Generic

	Mel Choyce on why machines and algorithms aren’t neutral, why we as developers, as people working in and with tech should embrace being political instead of trying to deny the truth. We can choose what to do; We can create different algorithms.

Tooling

	Ire Aderinokun shares how she created a Puppeteer script that creates automated screenshots as fallbacks for embed widgets from a webpage, automatically hosted on Cloudinary.

Security

	There are dozens of adblockers and tracking blockers on our computers these days, some even built into the browsers. But we still see tracking in some places, one of them by Eulerian, a leading tracking company. How did they do that? They found a way to use a technique called CNAME Cloaking and trick customers into adopting these privacy-invading, scary DNS hacking practices. With that, it becomes more and more important to change your default DNS provider to one that tries to protect your privacy, like 1.1.1.1 by Cloudflare or NextDNS, or your own pi-hole at home running on a RaspberryPi for free.

Accessibility

	63% of surveyed developers don’t test for accessibility of their work, it seems. Bruce Lawson reacted and created a 4-minutes business case of testing and solving the biggest accessibility issues. Our turn now.
	Heydon Pickering’s new book “Inclusive Components” is here. It has guides how to build better modals, tabbed interfaces, collapsible sections, cards, tooltips, or toggle features.

JavaScript

	Unconventional to read about that topic from a developer point of view but that makes it so great as resources on it are so rare: Christian Schäfer wrote a blog post on how to deal with ads in 2020. This is about what still sucks about ads, but as more than enough sites rely on them we need a solid concept to integrate it with the least impact on users possible. A lesson on the &lt;xmp&gt; element, lazy loading via Intersection Observer API, creating Contextual Fragments, combined with the connection information from the browser results in ads on sites that most of us would maybe even love but at least not be annoyed of.
	We all use Custom Select elements. But most of them are less than optimal when it comes to UX or accessibility. Julie Grundy shares her approach of making a better custom select element.

CSS

	An interesting rundown by Dylan Paulus on how Facebook ensures their ads are shown to the users, regardless which ad blockers they use. They use splitting legally required text into single character span elements as data-attributes.
	Bri Camp Gomez on who we can create overlapping images in CSS with CSS Grid and without all the hassle we had with such layouts in the past.
	Thomas Steiner on how we can implement prefers-color-scheme in SVG favicons to achieve dark mode icons via inline CSS Media Queries in the SVG.

Work &amp; Life

	It’s not entirely new and has been suspected and shared in the news already that there’s a huge addiction to the smartphone and it affects our health. But this clinical study on young people reveals alarming results: Every fourth child (or young people) faces Problematic Smarthone Use, a diagnosis that indicates addiction to the phone accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health.
	The path to mastery is available to all of us. With enough effort and persistence, achieving greatness in a chosen field is within reach. We can capture genius and direct our focus and attention to a singular aim that brings both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Today it’s just an uncommon, almost forgotten path to go inside our fast-paced, throw-away society but that doesn’t make it less worthy to follow, quite the contrary.

Go beyond…

	On ethics in our society by the one who played Ali G, Borat and Admiral General Aladeen. Sacha Baron Cohen with an important message on the social media giants, namely here Facebook: Facebook would have let Hitler buy ads for &#039;final solution&#039;. And it’s not deniable but instead, totally reconstructable for each of us and we’ve seen the principle happening in the past years during elections.
	We knew that microplastics—the tiny pieces of broken-down plastic bottles and other garbage—can now be found everywhere from Arctic ice to bottled water to seafood. But scientists figured out in new studies that there are a million times more microplastics in the ocean than we thought until now.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

what makes a good product? Well, it’s more than a great idea. It’s all the little details, from how you do product management, who much you care about accessibility, usability, good performance, caching to typographic details. It all makes the difference. We can choose where to put our focus.
Let’s start caring about small details, not just the big picture. And we can apply it to our entire life—whether it’s perfecting the tea brewing, yoga pose or avoiding waste, driving less with a car or growing some plants at home. If we care about something or someone, we’ll be rewarded.
News

	The 2019 Web Almanac is out. It’s a state of the art report by the HTTP Archive about used technology (choices) and reveals quite some interesting data.

Generic

	Jiaona Zhang on why we shouldn’t serve burnt pizza. Seriously, she shares why MVPs are not the best way to build a product but building a Minimum Lovable Product is. A solid article on how to build better products and evolve them.

UI/UX

	This is an open source illustrations kit that we are allowed to use on our websites. It features really nice graphical art and it includes already quite some symbols.
	Nana Jeon on how to create a card component that’s accessible and works with all the different action states.

Tooling

	Google now offers us a way to run the Lighthouse tool as Continuous Improvement (CI) service, and there’s even a Github Action for it.

Web Performance

	Aaron Gustafson shares various caching strategies in the age of Progressive Web Applications, which is a good idea to follow because things are differently if you use Service Worker.

Accessibility

	Hampus Sethfors on why there’s likely a better way than showing disabled buttons on webpages.

JavaScript

	Rik Schennink how we can crop images to a specific aspect ratio with JavaScript with the HTML Canvas API.

CSS

	Robin Rendle on how we can improve showing numbers in a table or list and align them better with CSS typography options. This technique is especially useful for currency based calculations.

Work &amp; Life

	Deadlines can be really useful but they can also have a super negative impact. When people say “deadline” we often mean many different things. Adam Blanchard says, the first step to better using deadlines is to understand exactly what expectations you are trying to set.
	Adam Blanchard shares a method to find ways how to lead self organising teams, avoid micro management but also avoid macromanaging and keeping it in balance.

Go beyond…

	Crypto currencies sound exciting to us but the mining is bad for our energy households, for the climate and electric power consumption. In Georgia, 10% of the nation’s power consumption is crypto mining. Still want to have crypto currency in your wallets?
	Arvind Narayanan shares how we can recognize AI snake oil, what’s false promises and what’s worth the term “intelligence”. He for example shows why AI doesn’t really work for hiring and why it’s so easy to trick such mechanisms as candidate.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

Sometimes a break is needed but you don’t notice. With the last WDRL edition on SmashingMag in September, this was apparently the case for me with this project. First, I wanted to pause for two weeks but it turned easily into over a month now. It brought back my motivation to write the summary for you and here is a quite big list with articles I want to recommend to you.
News

	Firefox 70 is out and new is CSS text-decoration-thickness, text-underline-offset, two-keyword display values like display: block flex; to allow outer and inner box settings, numeric separators in JavaScript, Intl improvements. You can now also use % in opacity property values.
	In the meantime, Chrome 77 and 78 have been released and bring the Largest Contentful Paint API, the formdata event as well as Form-associated custom elements, native lazy loading via the loading=&quot;lazy&quot; attribute,  a new Contact Picker API, and the CSS Properties and Values API.

Generic

	Ethan Marcotte’s talk “The World-Wide Work” is important to read and or watch for all of us. The importance of small little details and their impact on accessibility, or the society, the power of design in our world and how the web plays a role in here, too.
	Itamar Turner-Trauring shares great tips on What can a software developer do about climate change? and yes, it’s providing background and suggesting very useful, practicable actions that everyone of us can do. Not one of those generic, unrealistic posts but really down to the point.

UI/UX

	Why is it important to have an opinion and share your values as a brand? Here’s an evaluation of brands with and without opinions and how they market their product differently.
	The Stripe design team shares how they designed an accessible color system and we can learn a lot from it, not only from accessibility perspective but also to improve the design itself.
	Alexis Beingessner shares the problems of text rendering in browsers in his article “Text Rendering Hates You” and why subpixel-rendering and aliasing can cause quite some problems with text.
	Recycling is hard and we’re not good at it. Now it seems part of it is the messaging around it and the currently used strategy of demanding people to recycle is not motivating to people. If we’d instead advertise recycling as “giving this product a new life, it could e.g. become a new jacket” this is way more motivating for us to separate and care about where we throw our recyclables. A great lesson of how much it matters how you ask people to do something.
	To be planet-centric, designers need to be diverse and inclusive in their influences and practice. Understanding the colonisation of design education and exploring other ways of knowing will be critical to unlocking more interconnected, systemic design practices.

Tooling

	Patrick Fulton provides a good introduction into the most common visual regresstion testing systems and how we can and should use them in our projects.

Web Performance

	Joseph Scott found a Chrome announcement that’s going to change how the browser caches resources, especially those resources coming from CDNs. It’s also a nice little lesson on browser and web security.

Accessibility

	An one presentation tries to rule it all about accessibility, and it’s a good and massive one. Easy to understand, we can learn what our common mistakes are as developers and learn how to implement accessibility correctly without any compromises in design.

JavaScript

	The most common One Time Password (OTP) method today is via SMS. With the new SMS Receiver API, available in Chrome as Origin trial, brings this verification method to the web. Native apps had the feature of verifying an account via SMS and automatically retrieving the code from the SMS in your app already, and the goal is to make that feature available in the web, too. Note that SMS still is not a very secure method and can be intercepted by a third-party.

CSS

	Can I email is a great resource to find out which elements and CSS properties and values you can use in email clients…
	Tobias Ahlin shares how we can create smoother and sharper shadows with layered box-shadows. A very good solution!
	You can use pseudo elements to create cool effects for hover states in CSS.

Work &amp; Life

	“Don’t throw in the day job to follow your dream”. Join the bifurcators who juggle work-for-pay and their work-for-love.
	How to make life more pleasurable is a reminder how we should try to limit what we consume, what we watch, drink, eat, and how we see sleep in order to make the experience better.
	Everyone I know has this problem: there never seems to be enough time in the day for everything we need or want to do. The secret is to work and act with appreciation and focus and this article gives suggestions and hints how we can implement that into our daily work.

Go beyond…

	These washing machines try to stop microfibers right before they enter the water ecosystem from our households. IT’s nice to see that there is new traditional household hardware coming up to solve our society’s biggest problems.
	Despite the lawsuits and predictions of gridlock, restricting a single Manhattan street to buses has been a success. So why don’t we start from here and take it further to improve our lives and planet?
	Big tech isn’t interested in a better world, just a more profitable one. To beat it, we need to break its stranglehold on us. A very insightful piece of writing around how companies fuel and influence politics and our entire economy and world, not always to the better.
	Technology was supposed to bring us together. Instead, it has been tearing us apart. Human relationships are increasingly being replaced with virtual ones. This grassroots project questions this trend, in the the hope that we reconnect again.

    <p class="article__summary">Hey,

This isn’t business as usual, we can come to that later. Business as usual has time but we can use a short break to finally start shaping our own future. From September 20th – 27th 2019 millions of us will walk out of our workplaces and homes to join young climate strikers on the streets and demand an end to the age of fossil fuels. I’m ready and will support this movement. 
If not for ourselves, our relatives, our children, who do we earn all that money for? If we really think about it: What’s all the money worth if the climate we live in, the world and society we live in isn’t worth living anymore? What if we live in a place that’ll be flooded by the sea, that’ll be burning down every summer? Let’s do our best to act on our own to cut down emissions and drive less by car, fly less around the world, especially if it’s “for fun”. Let’s go on the streets and demand politicians to act on the matter as well. And let’s show our employers, companies around the world that they need to act as well.
Together we can change everything, we just need to stop doing business as usual for a day and set a sign. After that, we can focus on work again—and likely with a better feeling and more motivation.
Tooling

	There’s a new tool in town if you want to have a status page for your web service: The great people from Oh Dear now also provide status pages.
	Bastian Allgeier on Simplicity on the web, where we started and where we’re at now. Call it nostalgic or not, the times when we simply uploaded a file via FTP and it was live on servers were easy days. Now with all the CI/CD tooling around, we clearly have gotten many advantages in terms of security, version management and testability. However, a simple solution looks different.

Work &amp; Life

	Adam Blanchard wrote down notes and thoughts from TechFestival in Copenhagen and shares behaviours that transform organisations
	Why trying to follow the question of how to motivate employees is misguided and how to be a great manager by supporting employees’ own thoughts, ideas and with that foster self-motivation.

Go beyond…

	Snøhetta&#039;s Powerhouse Brattørkaia produces twice the energy it uses by using clever architecture and technology like solar panels all over the place. Isn’t that an office building we’d love to go to for work?

    <p class="article__summary">CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.



Round displays, for example, make it fun to play with circular clip areas. Mobile screen notches and virtual keyboards offer challenges to best organize content that stays clear of them. And dual screen or foldable devices make us rethink how to best use available space in a number of different device postures.



Sketches of a round display, a common rectangular mobile display, and a device with a foldable display.



These recent evolutions of the web platform made it both more challenging and more interesting to design products. They’re great opportunities for us to break out of our rectangular boxes.



I’d like to talk about a new feature similar to the above: the Window Controls Overlay for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).



Progressive Web Apps are blurring the lines between apps and websites. They combine the best of both worlds. On one hand, they’re stable, linkable, searchable, and responsive just like websites. On the other hand, they provide additional powerful capabilities, work offline, and read files just like native apps.



As a design surface, PWAs are really interesting because they challenge us to think about what mixing web and device-native user interfaces can be. On desktop devices in particular, we have more than 40 years of history telling us what applications should look like, and it can be hard to break out of this mental model.



At the end of the day though, PWAs on desktop are constrained to the window they appear in: a rectangle with a title bar at the top.



Here’s what a typical desktop PWA app looks like:



Sketches of two rectangular user interfaces representing the desktop Progressive Web App status quo on the macOS and Windows operating systems, respectively. 



Sure, as the author of a PWA, you get to choose the color of the title bar (using the Web Application Manifest theme_color property), but that’s about it.



What if we could think outside this box, and reclaim the real estate of the app’s entire window? Doing so would give us a chance to make our apps more beautiful and feel more integrated in the operating system.



This is exactly what the Window Controls Overlay offers. This new PWA functionality makes it possible to take advantage of the full surface area of the app, including where the title bar normally appears.



About the title bar and window controls



Let’s start with an explanation of what the title bar and window controls are.



The title bar is the area displayed at the top of an app window, which usually contains the app’s name. Window controls are the affordances, or buttons, that make it possible to minimize, maximize, or close the app’s window, and are also displayed at the top.

Window Controls Overlay removes the physical constraint of the title bar and window controls areas. It frees up the full height of the app window, enabling the title bar and window control buttons to be overlaid on top of the application’s web content.

If you are reading this article on a desktop computer, take a quick look at other apps. Chances are they’re already doing something similar to this. In fact, the very web browser you are using to read this uses the top area to display tabs.

Spotify displays album artwork all the way to the top edge of the application window.

Album artwork spans the entire width of the main content area, all the way to the top and right edges of the window, and the right edge of the main navigation area on the left side. The application and album navigation controls are overlaid directly on top of the album artwork.



Microsoft Word uses the available title bar space to display the auto-save and search functionalities, and more.



A screenshot of Microsoft Word’s toolbar interface. Document file information, search, and other functionality appear at the top of the window, sharing the same horizontal space as the app’s window controls.



The whole point of this feature is to allow you to make use of this space with your own content while providing a way to account for the window control buttons. And it enables you to offer this modified experience on a range of platforms while not adversely affecting the experience on browsers or devices that don’t support Window Controls Overlay. After all, PWAs are all about progressive enhancement, so this feature is a chance to enhance your app to use this extra space when it’s available.



Let’s use the feature



For the rest of this article, we’ll be working on a demo app to learn more about using the feature.



The demo app is called 1DIV. It’s a simple CSS playground where users can create designs using CSS and a single HTML element.



The app has two pages. The first lists the existing CSS designs you’ve created:



A screenshot of the 1DIV app displaying a thumbnail grid of CSS designs a user created.



The second page enables you to create and edit CSS designs:



A screenshot of the 1DIV app editor page. The top half of the window displays a rendered CSS design, and a text editor on the bottom half of the window displays the CSS used to create it.



Since I’ve added a simple web manifest and service worker, we can install the app as a PWA on desktop. Here is what it looks like on macOS:



Screenshots of the 1DIV app thumbnail view and CSS editor view on macOS. This version of the app’s window has a separate control bar at the top for the app name and window control buttons.



And on Windows:



Screenshots of the 1DIV app thumbnail view and CSS editor view on the Windows operating system. This version of the app’s window also has a separate control bar at the top for the app name and window control buttons.



Our app is looking good, but the white title bar in the first page is wasted space. In the second page, it would be really nice if the design area went all the way to the top of the app window.



Let’s use the Window Controls Overlay feature to improve this.



Enabling Window Controls Overlay



The feature is still experimental at the moment. To try it, you need to enable it in one of the supported browsers.



As of now, it has been implemented in Chromium, as a collaboration between Microsoft and Google. We can therefore use it in Chrome or Edge by going to the internal about://flags page, and enabling the Desktop PWA Window Controls Overlay flag.



Using Window Controls Overlay



To use the feature, we need to add the following display_override member to our web app’s manifest file:



{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;1DIV&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;1DIV is a mini CSS playground&quot;,
  &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en-US&quot;,
  &quot;start_url&quot;: &quot;/&quot;,
  &quot;theme_color&quot;: &quot;#ffffff&quot;,
  &quot;background_color&quot;: &quot;#ffffff&quot;,
  &quot;display_override&quot;: [
    &quot;window-controls-overlay&quot;
  ],
  &quot;icons&quot;: [
    ...
  ]
}




On the surface, the feature is really simple to use. This manifest change is the only thing we need to make the title bar disappear and turn the window controls into an overlay.



However, to provide a great experience for all users regardless of what device or browser they use, and to make the most of the title bar area in our design, we’ll need a bit of CSS and JavaScript code.



Here is what the app looks like now:



Screenshot of the 1DIV app thumbnail view using Window Controls Overlay on macOS. The separate top bar area is gone, but the window controls are now blocking some of the app’s interface



The title bar is gone, which is what we wanted, but our logo, search field, and NEW button are partially covered by the window controls because now our layout starts at the top of the window.



It’s similar on Windows, with the difference that the close, maximize, and minimize buttons appear on the right side, grouped together with the PWA control buttons:



Screenshot of the 1DIV app thumbnail display using Window Controls Overlay on the Windows operating system. The separate top bar area is gone, but the window controls are now blocking some of the app’s content.



Using CSS to keep clear of the window controls



Along with the feature, new CSS environment variables have been introduced:



titlebar-area-xtitlebar-area-ytitlebar-area-widthtitlebar-area-height



You use these variables with the CSS env() function to position your content where the title bar would have been while ensuring it won’t overlap with the window controls. In our case, we’ll use two of the variables to position our header, which contains the logo, search bar, and NEW button. 



header {
  position: absolute;
  left: env(titlebar-area-x, 0);
  width: env(titlebar-area-width, 100%);
  height: var(--toolbar-height);
}




The titlebar-area-x variable gives us the distance from the left of the viewport to where the title bar would appear, and titlebar-area-width is its width. (Remember, this is not equivalent to the width of the entire viewport, just the title bar portion, which as noted earlier, doesn’t include the window controls.)



By doing this, we make sure our content remains fully visible. We’re also defining fallback values (the second parameter in the env() function) for when the variables are not defined (such as on non-supporting browsers, or when the Windows Control Overlay feature is disabled).



Screenshot of the 1DIV app thumbnail view on macOS with Window Controls Overlay and our CSS updated. The app content that the window controls had been blocking has been repositioned.

Now our header adapts to its surroundings, and it doesn’t feel like the window control buttons have been added as an afterthought. The app looks a lot more like a native app.



Changing the window controls background color so it blends in



Now let’s take a closer look at our second page: the CSS playground editor.



Screenshots of the 1DIV app CSS editor view with Window Controls Overlay in macOS and Windows, respectively. The window controls overlay areas have a solid white background color, which contrasts with the hot pink color of the example CSS design displayed in the editor.



Not great. Our CSS demo area does go all the way to the top, which is what we wanted, but the way the window controls appear as white rectangles on top of it is quite jarring.



We can fix this by changing the app’s theme color. There are a couple of ways to define it:



PWAs can define a theme color in the web app manifest file using the theme_color manifest member. This color is then used by the OS in different ways. On desktop platforms, it is used to provide a background color to the title bar and window controls.Websites can use the theme-color meta tag as well. It’s used by browsers to customize the color of the UI around the web page. For PWAs, this color can override the manifest theme_color.



In our case, we can set the manifest theme_color to white to provide the right default color for our app. The OS will read this color value when the app is installed and use it to make the window controls background color white. This color works great for our main page with the list of demos.



The theme-color meta tag can be changed at runtime, using JavaScript. So we can do that to override the white with the right demo background color when one is opened.



Here is the function we’ll use:



function themeWindow(bgColor) {
  document.querySelector(&quot;meta[name=theme-color]&quot;).setAttribute(&#039;content&#039;, bgColor);
}



With this in place, we can imagine how using color and CSS transitions can produce a smooth change from the list page to the demo page, and enable the window control buttons to blend in with the rest of the app’s interface.



Screenshot of the 1DIV app CSS editor view on the Windows operating system with Window Controls Overlay and updated CSS demonstrating how the window control buttons blend in with the rest of the app’s interface.



Dragging the window



Now, getting rid of the title bar entirely does have an important accessibility consequence: it’s much more difficult to move the application window around.



The title bar provides a sizable area for users to click and drag, but by using the Window Controls Overlay feature, this area becomes limited to where the control buttons are, and users have to very precisely aim between these buttons to move the window.



Fortunately, this can be fixed using CSS with the app-region property. This property is, for now, only supported in Chromium-based browsers and needs the -webkit- vendor prefix. 



To make any element of the app become a dragging target for the window, we can use the following: 



-webkit-app-region: drag;



It is also possible to explicitly make an element non-draggable: 



-webkit-app-region: no-drag; 



These options can be useful for us. We can make the entire header a dragging target, but make the search field and NEW button within it non-draggable so they can still be used as normal.



However, because the editor page doesn’t display the header, users wouldn’t be able to drag the window while editing code. So let&#039;s use a different approach. We’ll create another element before our header, also absolutely positioned, and dedicated to dragging the window.



&lt;div class=&quot;drag&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;header&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;



.drag {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: env(titlebar-area-height, 0);
  -webkit-app-region: drag;
}



With the above code, we’re making the draggable area span the entire viewport width, and using the titlebar-area-height variable to make it as tall as what the title bar would have been. This way, our draggable area is aligned with the window control buttons as shown below.



And, now, to make sure our search field and button remain usable:



header .search,
header .new {
  -webkit-app-region: no-drag;
}



With the above code, users can click and drag where the title bar used to be. It is an area that users expect to be able to use to move windows on desktop, and we’re not breaking this expectation, which is good.

Adapting to window resize



It may be useful for an app to know both whether the window controls overlay is visible and when its size changes. In our case, if the user made the window very narrow, there wouldn’t be enough space for the search field, logo, and button to fit, so we’d want to push them down a bit.



The Window Controls Overlay feature comes with a JavaScript API we can use to do this: navigator.windowControlsOverlay.



The API provides three interesting things:



navigator.windowControlsOverlay.visible lets us know whether the overlay is visible.navigator.windowControlsOverlay.getBoundingClientRect() lets us know the position and size of the title bar area.navigator.windowControlsOverlay.ongeometrychange lets us know when the size or visibility changes.



Let’s use this to be aware of the size of the title bar area and move the header down if it’s too narrow.



if (navigator.windowControlsOverlay) {
  navigator.windowControlsOverlay.addEventListener(&#039;geometrychange&#039;, () =&gt; {
    const { width } = navigator.windowControlsOverlay.getBoundingClientRect();
    document.body.classList.toggle(&#039;narrow&#039;, width &lt; 250);
  });
}



In the example above, we set the narrow class on the body of the app if the title bar area is narrower than 250px. We could do something similar with a media query, but using the windowControlsOverlay API has two advantages for our use case:



It’s only fired when the feature is supported and used; we don’t want to adapt the design otherwise.We get the size of the title bar area across operating systems, which is great because the size of the window controls is different on Mac and Windows. Using a media query wouldn’t make it possible for us to know exactly how much space remains.



.narrow header {
  top: env(titlebar-area-height, 0);
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
}



Using the above CSS code, we can move our header down to stay clear of the window control buttons when the window is too narrow, and move the thumbnails down accordingly.

Thirty pixels of exciting design opportunities



Using the Window Controls Overlay feature, we were able to take our simple demo app and turn it into something that feels so much more integrated on desktop devices. Something that reaches out of the usual window constraints and provides a custom experience for its users.



In reality, this feature only gives us about 30 pixels of extra room and comes with challenges on how to deal with the window controls. And yet, this extra room and those challenges can be turned into exciting design opportunities.



More devices of all shapes and forms get invented all the time, and the web keeps on evolving to adapt to them. New features get added to the web platform to allow us, web authors, to integrate more and more deeply with those devices. From watches or foldable devices to desktop computers, we need to evolve our design approach for the web. Building for the web now lets us think outside the rectangular box.



So let’s embrace this. Let’s use the standard technologies already at our disposal, and experiment with new ideas to provide tailored experiences for all devices, all from a single codebase!



If you get a chance to try the Window Controls Overlay feature and have feedback about it, you can open issues on the spec’s repository. It’s still early in the development of this feature, and you can help make it even better. Or, you can take a look at the feature’s existing documentation, or this demo app and its source code.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.” 



Here’s the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it’s their idea. 



In this article, I’ll show you how to collaboratively expose misalignment and gaps in the team’s shared understanding by bringing the team together around two simple questions:



What are the objects?What are the relationships between those objects?



A gauntlet between research and screen design



These two questions align to the first two steps of the ORCA process, which might become your new best friend when it comes to reducing guesswork. Wait, what’s ORCA?! Glad you asked.



ORCA stands for Objects, Relationships, CTAs, and Attributes, and it outlines a process for creating solid object-oriented user experiences. Object-oriented UX is my design philosophy. ORCA is an iterative methodology for synthesizing user research into an elegant structural foundation to support screen and interaction design. OOUX and ORCA have made my work as a UX designer more collaborative, effective, efficient, fun, strategic, and meaningful.



The ORCA process has four iterative rounds and a whopping fifteen steps. In each round we get more clarity on our Os, Rs, Cs, and As.



The four rounds and fifteen steps of the ORCA process. In the OOUX world, we love color-coding. Blue is reserved for objects! (Yellow is for core content, pink is for metadata, and green is for calls-to-action. Learn more about the color-coded object map and connecting CTAs to objects.)



I sometimes say that ORCA is a “garbage in, garbage out” process. To ensure that the testable prototype produced in the final round actually tests well, the process needs to be fed by good research. But if you don’t have a ton of research, the beginning of the ORCA process serves another purpose: it helps you sell the need for research.



ORCA strengthens the weak spot between research and design by helping distill research into solid information architecture—scaffolding for the screen design and interaction design to hang on.



In other words, the ORCA process serves as a gauntlet between research and design. With good research, you can gracefully ride the killer whale from research into design. But without good research, the process effectively spits you back into research and with a cache of specific open questions.



Getting in the same curiosity-boat



What gets us into trouble is not what we don’t know. It’s what we know for sure that just ain’t so.Mark Twain



The first two steps of the ORCA process—Object Discovery and Relationship Discovery—shine a spotlight on the dark, dusty corners of your team’s misalignments and any inherent complexity that’s been swept under the rug. It begins to expose what this classic comic so beautifully illustrates:



The original “Tree Swing Project Management” cartoon dates back to the 1960s or 1970s and has no artist attribution we could find.



This is one reason why so many UX designers are frustrated in their job and why many projects fail. And this is also why we often can’t sell research: every decision-maker is confident in their own mental picture. 



Once we expose hidden fuzzy patches in each picture and the differences between them all, the case for user research makes itself.



But how we do this is important. However much we might want to, we can’t just tell everyone, “YOU ARE WRONG!” Instead, we need to facilitate and guide our team members to self-identify holes in their picture. When stakeholders take ownership of assumptions and gaps in understanding, BAM! Suddenly, UX research is not such a hard sell, and everyone is aboard the same curiosity-boat.



Say your users are doctors. And you have no idea how doctors use the system you are tasked with redesigning.



You might try to sell research by honestly saying: “We need to understand doctors better! What are their pain points? How do they use the current app?” But here’s the problem with that. Those questions are vague, and the answers to them don’t feel acutely actionable.



Instead, you want your stakeholders themselves to ask super-specific questions. This is more like the kind of conversation you need to facilitate. Let’s listen in:



“Wait a sec, how often do doctors share patients? Does a patient in this system have primary and secondary doctors?”



“Can a patient even have more than one primary doctor?”



“Is it a ‘primary doctor’ or just a ‘primary caregiver’… Can’t that role be a nurse practitioner?”



“No, caregivers are something else… That’s the patient’s family contacts, right?”



“So are caregivers in scope for this redesign?”



“Yeah, because if a caregiver is present at an appointment, the doctor needs to note that. Like, tag the caregiver on the note… Or on the appointment?”



Now we are getting somewhere. Do you see how powerful it can be getting stakeholders to debate these questions themselves? The diabolical goal here is to shake their confidence—gently and diplomatically.



When these kinds of questions bubble up collaboratively and come directly from the mouths of your stakeholders and decision-makers, suddenly, designing screens without knowing the answers to these questions seems incredibly risky, even silly.



If we create software without understanding the real-world information environment of our users, we will likely create software that does not align to the real-world information environment of our users. And this will, hands down, result in a more confusing, more complex, and less intuitive software product.



The two questions



But how do we get to these kinds of meaty questions diplomatically, efficiently, collaboratively, and reliably? 



We can do this by starting with those two big questions that align to the first two steps of the ORCA process:



What are the objects?What are the relationships between those objects?



In practice, getting to these answers is easier said than done. I’m going to show you how these two simple questions can provide the outline for an Object Definition Workshop. During this workshop, these “seed” questions will blossom into dozens of specific questions and shine a spotlight on the need for more user research.



Prep work: Noun foraging



In the next section, I’ll show you how to run an Object Definition Workshop with your stakeholders (and entire cross-functional team, hopefully). But first, you need to do some prep work.



Basically, look for nouns that are particular to the business or industry of your project, and do it across at least a few sources. I call this noun foraging.



Here are just a few great noun foraging sources:



the product’s marketing sitethe product’s competitors’ marketing sites (competitive analysis, anyone?)the existing product (look at labels!)user interview transcriptsnotes from stakeholder interviews or vision docs from stakeholders



Put your detective hat on, my dear Watson. Get resourceful and leverage what you have. If all you have is a marketing website, some screenshots of the existing legacy system, and access to customer service chat logs, then use those.



As you peruse these sources, watch for the nouns that are used over and over again, and start listing them (preferably on blue sticky notes if you’ll be creating an object map later!).



You’ll want to focus on nouns that might represent objects in your system. If you are having trouble determining if a noun might be object-worthy, remember the acronym SIP and test for:



StructureInstancesPurpose



Think of a library app, for example. Is “book” an object?



Structure: can you think of a few attributes for this potential object? Title, author, publish date… Yep, it has structure. Check!



Instance: what are some examples of this potential “book” object? Can you name a few? The Alchemist, Ready Player One, Everybody Poops… OK, check!



Purpose: why is this object important to the users and business? Well, “book” is what our library client is providing to people and books are why people come to the library… Check, check, check!



SIP: Structure, Instances, and Purpose! (Here’s a flowchart where I elaborate even more on SIP.)



As you are noun foraging, focus on capturing the nouns that have SIP. Avoid capturing components like dropdowns, checkboxes, and calendar pickers—your UX system is not your design system! Components are just the packaging for objects—they are a means to an end. No one is coming to your digital place to play with your dropdown! They are coming for the VALUABLE THINGS and what they can do with them. Those things, or objects, are what we are trying to identify.



Let’s say we work for a startup disrupting the email experience. This is how I’d start my noun foraging.



First I’d look at my own email client, which happens to be Gmail. I’d then look at Outlook and the new HEY email. I’d look at Yahoo, Hotmail…I’d even look at Slack and Basecamp and other so-called “email replacers.” I’d read some articles, reviews, and forum threads where people are complaining about email. While doing all this, I would look for and write down the nouns.



(Before moving on, feel free to go noun foraging for this hypothetical product, too, and then scroll down to see how much our lists match up. Just don’t get lost in your own emails! Come back to me!)



Drumroll, please…



Here are a few nouns I came up with during my noun foraging:



email messagethreadcontactclientrule/automationemail address that is not a contact?contact groupsattachmentGoogle doc file / other integrated filenewsletter? (HEY treats this differently)saved responses and templates



In the OOUX world, we love color-coding. Blue is reserved for objects! (Yellow is for core content, pink is for metadata, and green is for calls-to-action. Learn more about the color coded object map and connecting CTAs to objects.)



Scan your list of nouns and pick out words that you are completely clueless about. In our email example, it might be client or automation. Do as much homework as you can before your session with stakeholders: google what’s googleable. But other terms might be so specific to the product or domain that you need to have a conversation about them.



Aside: here are some real nouns foraged during my own past project work that I needed my stakeholders to help me understand:



Record LocatorIncentive HomeAugmented Line ItemCurriculum-Based Measurement Probe



This is really all you need to prepare for the workshop session: a list of nouns that represent potential objects and a short list of nouns that need to be defined further.



Facilitate an Object Definition Workshop



You could actually start your workshop with noun foraging—this activity can be done collaboratively. If you have five people in the room, pick five sources, assign one to every person, and give everyone ten minutes to find the objects within their source. When the time’s up, come together and find the overlap. Affinity mapping is your friend here!



If your team is short on time and might be reluctant to do this kind of grunt work (which is usually the case) do your own noun foraging beforehand, but be prepared to show your work. I love presenting screenshots of documents and screens with all the nouns already highlighted. Bring the artifacts of your process, and start the workshop with a five-minute overview of your noun foraging journey.



HOT TIP: before jumping into the workshop, frame the conversation as a requirements-gathering session to help you better understand the scope and details of the system. You don’t need to let them know that you’re looking for gaps in the team’s understanding so that you can prove the need for more user research—that will be our little secret. Instead, go into the session optimistically, as if your knowledgeable stakeholders and PMs and biz folks already have all the answers. 



Then, let the question whack-a-mole commence.



1. What is this thing?



Want to have some real fun? At the beginning of your session, ask stakeholders to privately write definitions for the handful of obscure nouns you might be uncertain about. Then, have everyone show their cards at the same time and see if you get different definitions (you will). This is gold for exposing misalignment and starting great conversations.



As your discussion unfolds, capture any agreed-upon definitions. And when uncertainty emerges, quietly (but visibly) start an “open questions” parking lot. 😉



After definitions solidify, here’s a great follow-up:



2. Do our users know what these things are? What do users call this thing?



Stakeholder 1: They probably call email clients “apps.” But I’m not sure.



Stakeholder 2: Automations are often called “workflows,” I think. Or, maybe users think workflows are something different.



If a more user-friendly term emerges, ask the group if they can agree to use only that term moving forward. This way, the team can better align to the users’ language and mindset.



OK, moving on. 



If you have two or more objects that seem to overlap in purpose, ask one of these questions:



3. Are these the same thing? Or are these different? If they are not the same, how are they different?



You: Is a saved response the same as a template?



Stakeholder 1: Yes! Definitely.



Stakeholder 2: I don’t think so… A saved response is text with links and variables, but a template is more about the look and feel, like default fonts, colors, and placeholder images. 



Continue to build out your growing glossary of objects. And continue to capture areas of uncertainty in your “open questions” parking lot.



If you successfully determine that two similar things are, in fact, different, here’s your next follow-up question:



4. What’s the relationship between these objects?



You: Are saved responses and templates related in any way?



Stakeholder 3:  Yeah, a template can be applied to a saved response.



You, always with the follow-ups: When is the template applied to a saved response? Does that happen when the user is constructing the saved response? Or when they apply the saved response to an email? How does that actually work?



Listen. Capture uncertainty. Once the list of “open questions” grows to a critical mass, pause to start assigning questions to groups or individuals. Some questions might be for the dev team (hopefully at least one developer is in the room with you). One question might be specifically for someone who couldn’t make it to the workshop. And many questions will need to be labeled “user.” 



Do you see how we are building up to our UXR sales pitch?



5. Is this object in scope?



Your next question narrows the team’s focus toward what’s most important to your users. You can simply ask, “Are saved responses in scope for our first release?,” but I’ve got a better, more devious strategy.



By now, you should have a list of clearly defined objects. Ask participants to sort these objects from most to least important, either in small breakout groups or individually. Then, like you did with the definitions, have everyone reveal their sort order at once. Surprisingly—or not so surprisingly—it’s not unusual for the VP to rank something like “saved responses” as #2 while everyone else puts it at the bottom of the list. Try not to look too smug as you inevitably expose more misalignment.



I did this for a startup a few years ago. We posted the three groups’ wildly different sort orders on the whiteboard.



Here’s a snippet of the very messy middle from this session: three columns of object cards, showing the same cards prioritized completely differently by three different groups.



The CEO stood back, looked at it, and said, “This is why we haven’t been able to move forward in two years.”



Admittedly, it’s tragic to hear that, but as a professional, it feels pretty awesome to be the one who facilitated a watershed realization.



Once you have a good idea of in-scope, clearly defined things, this is when you move on to doing more relationship mapping.



6. Create a visual representation of the objects’ relationships



We’ve already done a bit of this while trying to determine if two things are different, but this time, ask the team about every potential relationship. For each object, ask how it relates to all the other objects. In what ways are the objects connected? To visualize all the connections, pull out your trusty boxes-and-arrows technique. Here, we are connecting our objects with verbs. I like to keep my verbs to simple “has a” and “has many” statements.



A work-in-progress system model of our new email solution.



This system modeling activity brings up all sorts of new questions:



Can a saved response have attachments?Can a saved response use a template? If so, if an email uses a saved response with a template, can the user override that template?Do users want to see all the emails they sent that included a particular attachment? For example, “show me all the emails I sent with ProfessionalImage.jpg attached. I’ve changed my professional photo and I want to alert everyone to update it.” 



Solid answers might emerge directly from the workshop participants. Great! Capture that new shared understanding. But when uncertainty surfaces, continue to add questions to your growing parking lot.



Light the fuse



You’ve positioned the explosives all along the floodgates. Now you simply have to light the fuse and BOOM. Watch the buy-in for user research flooooow.



Before your workshop wraps up, have the group reflect on the list of open questions. Make plans for getting answers internally, then focus on the questions that need to be brought before users.



Here’s your final step. Take those questions you’ve compiled for user research and discuss the level of risk associated with NOT answering them. Ask, “if we design without an answer to this question, if we make up our own answer and we are wrong, how bad might that turn out?” 



With this methodology, we are cornering our decision-makers into advocating for user research as they themselves label questions as high-risk. Sorry, not sorry. 



Now is your moment of truth. With everyone in the room, ask for a reasonable budget of time and money to conduct 6–8 user interviews focused specifically on these questions. 



HOT TIP: if you are new to UX research, please note that you’ll likely need to rephrase the questions that came up during the workshop before you present them to users. Make sure your questions are open-ended and don’t lead the user into any default answers.



Final words: Hold the screen design!



Seriously, if at all possible, do not ever design screens again without first answering these fundamental questions: what are the objects and how do they relate?



I promise you this: if you can secure a shared understanding between the business, design, and development teams before you start designing screens, you will have less heartache and save more time and money, and (it almost feels like a bonus at this point!) users will be more receptive to what you put out into the world. 



I sincerely hope this helps you win time and budget to go talk to your users and gain clarity on what you are designing before you start building screens. If you find success using noun foraging and the Object Definition Workshop, there’s more where that came from in the rest of the ORCA process, which will help prevent even more late-in-the-game scope tugs-of-war and strategy pivots. 



All the best of luck! Now go sell research!

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.



But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content. 



I recently had the opportunity to lead the CMS implementation for a Fortune 500 company. The client was excited by the benefits of an omnichannel content strategy, including content reuse, multichannel marketing, and robot delivery—designing content to be intelligible to bots, Google knowledge panels, snippets, and voice user interfaces. 



A content model is a critical foundation for an omnichannel content strategy, and for our content to be understood by multiple systems, the model needed semantic types—types named according to their meaning instead of their presentation. Our goal was to let authors create content and reuse it wherever it was relevant. But as the project proceeded, I realized that supporting content reuse at the scale that my customer needed required the whole team to recognize a new pattern.



Despite our best intentions, we kept drawing from what we were more familiar with: design systems. Unlike web-focused content strategies, an omnichannel content strategy can’t rely on WYSIWYG tools for design and layout. Our tendency to approach the content model with our familiar design-system thinking constantly led us to veer away from one of the primary purposes of a content model: delivering content to audiences on multiple marketing channels.



Two essential principles for an effective content model



We needed to help our designers, developers, and stakeholders understand that we were doing something very different from their prior web projects, where it was natural for everyone to think about content as visual building blocks fitting into layouts. The previous approach was not only more familiar but also more intuitive—at least at first—because it made the designs feel more tangible. We discovered two principles that helped the team understand how a content model differs from the design systems that we were used to:



Content models must define semantics instead of layout.And content models should connect content that belongs together.



Semantic content models



A semantic content model uses type and attribute names that reflect the meaning of the content, not how it will be displayed. For example, in a nonsemantic model, teams might create types like teasers, media blocks, and cards. Although these types might make it easy to lay out content, they don’t help delivery channels understand the content’s meaning, which in turn would have opened the door to the content being presented in each marketing channel. In contrast, a semantic content model uses type names like product, service, and testimonial so that each delivery channel can understand the content and use it as it sees fit. 



When you’re creating a semantic content model, a great place to start is to look over the types and properties defined by Schema.org, a community-driven resource for type definitions that are intelligible to platforms like Google search.



A semantic content model has several benefits:



Even if your team doesn’t care about omnichannel content, a semantic content model decouples content from its presentation so that teams can evolve the website’s design without needing to refactor its content. In this way, content can withstand disruptive website redesigns. A semantic content model also provides a competitive edge. By adding structured data based on Schema.org’s types and properties, a website can provide hints to help Google understand the content, display it in search snippets or knowledge panels, and use it to answer voice-interface user questions. Potential visitors could discover your content without ever setting foot in your website.Beyond those practical benefits, you’ll also need a semantic content model if you want to deliver omnichannel content. To use the same content in multiple marketing channels, delivery channels need to be able to understand it. For example, if your content model were to provide a list of questions and answers, it could easily be rendered on a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page, but it could also be used in a voice interface or by a bot that answers common questions.



For example, using a semantic content model for articles, events, people, and locations lets A List Apart provide cleanly structured data for search engines so that users can read the content on the website, in Google knowledge panels, and even with hypothetical voice interfaces in the future.







Content models that connect



After struggling to describe what makes a good content model, I’ve come to realize that the best models are those that are semantic and that also connect related content components (such as a FAQ item’s question and answer pair), instead of slicing up related content across disparate content components. A good content model connects content that should remain together so that multiple delivery channels can use it without needing to first put those pieces back together.



Think about writing an article or essay. An article’s meaning and usefulness depends upon its parts being kept together. Would one of the headings or paragraphs be meaningful on their own without the context of the full article? On our project, our familiar design-system thinking often led us to want to create content models that would slice content into disparate chunks to fit the web-centric layout. This had a similar impact to an article that were to have been separated from its headline. Because we were slicing content into standalone pieces based on layout, content that belonged together became difficult to manage and nearly impossible for multiple delivery channels to understand.



To illustrate, let’s look at how connecting related content applies in a real-world scenario. The design team for our customer presented a complex layout for a software product page that included multiple tabs and sections. Our instincts were to follow suit with the content model. Shouldn’t we make it as easy and as flexible as possible to add any number of tabs in the future?



Because our design-system instincts were so familiar, it felt like we had needed a content type called “tab section” so that multiple tab sections could be added to a page. Each tab section would display various types of content. One tab might provide the software’s overview or its specifications. Another tab might provide a list of resources. 



Our inclination to break down the content model into “tab section” pieces would have led to an unnecessarily complex model and a cumbersome editing experience, and it would have also created content that couldn’t have been understood by additional delivery channels. For example, how would another system have been able to tell which “tab section” referred to a product’s specifications or its resource list—would that other system have to have resorted to counting tab sections and content blocks? This would have prevented the tabs from ever being reordered, and it would have required adding logic in every other delivery channel to interpret the design system’s layout. Furthermore, if the customer were to have no longer wanted to display this content in a tab layout, it would have been tedious to migrate to a new content model to reflect the new page redesign.



A content model based on design components is unnecessarily complex, and it’s unintelligible to systems.



We had a breakthrough when we discovered that our customer had a specific purpose in mind for each tab: it would reveal specific information such as the software product’s overview, specifications, related resources, and pricing. Once implementation began, our inclination to focus on what’s visual and familiar had obscured the intent of the designs. With a little digging, it didn’t take long to realize that the concept of tabs wasn’t relevant to the content model. The meaning of the content that they were planning to display in the tabs was what mattered.



In fact, the customer could have decided to display this content in a different way—without tabs—somewhere else. This realization prompted us to define content types for the software product based on the meaningful attributes that the customer had wanted to render on the web. There were obvious semantic attributes like name and description as well as rich attributes like screenshots, software requirements, and feature lists. The software’s product information stayed together because it wasn’t sliced across separate components like “tab sections” that were derived from the content’s presentation. Any delivery channel—including future ones—could understand and present this content.



A good content model connects content that belongs together so it can be easily managed and reused.



Conclusion



In this omnichannel marketing project, we discovered that the best way to keep our content model on track was to ensure that it was semantic (with type and attribute names that reflected the meaning of the content) and that it kept content together that belonged together (instead of fragmenting it). These two concepts curtailed our temptation to shape the content model based on the design. So if you’re working on a content model to support an omnichannel content strategy—or even if you just want to make sure that Google and other interfaces understand your content—remember:



A design system isn’t a content model. Team members may be tempted to conflate them and to make your content model mirror your design system, so you should protect the semantic value and contextual structure of the content strategy during the entire implementation process. This will let every delivery channel consume the content without needing a magic decoder ring.If your team is struggling to make this transition, you can still reap some of the benefits by using Schema.org–based structured data in your website. Even if additional delivery channels aren’t on the immediate horizon, the benefit to search engine optimization is a compelling reason on its own.Additionally, remind the team that decoupling the content model from the design will let them update the designs more easily because they won’t be held back by the cost of content migrations. They’ll be able to create new designs without the obstacle of compatibility between the design and the content, and ​they’ll be ready for the next big thing. 



By rigorously advocating for these principles, you’ll help your team treat content the way that it deserves—as the most critical asset in your user experience and the best way to connect with your audience.

    <p class="article__summary">Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that “intention without strategy is chaos.” We’ve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech—but what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.



This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)



The process for inclusive safety



When you are designing for safety, your goals are to:



identify ways your product can be used for abuse,design ways to prevent the abuse, andprovide support for vulnerable users to reclaim power and control.



The Process for Inclusive Safety is a tool to help you reach those goals (Fig 5.1). It’s a methodology I created in 2018 to capture the various techniques I was using when designing products with safety in mind. Whether you are creating an entirely new product or adding to an existing feature, the Process can help you make your product safe and inclusive. The Process includes five general areas of action:



Conducting researchCreating archetypesBrainstorming problemsDesigning solutionsTesting for safety



Fig 5.1: Each aspect of the Process for Inclusive Safety can be incorporated into your design process where it makes the most sense for you. The times given are estimates to help you incorporate the stages into your design plan.



The Process is meant to be flexible—it won’t make sense for teams to implement every step in some situations. Use the parts that are relevant to your unique work and context; this is meant to be something you can insert into your existing design practice.



And once you use it, if you have an idea for making it better or simply want to provide context of how it helped your team, please get in touch with me. It’s a living document that I hope will continue to be a useful and realistic tool that technologists can use in their day-to-day work.



If you’re working on a product specifically for a vulnerable group or survivors of some form of trauma, such as an app for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, or drug addiction, be sure to read Chapter 7, which covers that situation explicitly and should be handled a bit differently. The guidelines here are for prioritizing safety when designing a more general product that will have a wide user base (which, we already know from statistics, will include certain groups that should be protected from harm). Chapter 7 is focused on products that are specifically for vulnerable groups and people who have experienced trauma.



Step 1: Conduct research



Design research should include a broad analysis of how your tech might be weaponized for abuse as well as specific insights into the experiences of survivors and perpetrators of that type of abuse. At this stage, you and your team will investigate issues of interpersonal harm and abuse, and explore any other safety, security, or inclusivity issues that might be a concern for your product or service, like data security, racist algorithms, and harassment.



Broad research



Your project should begin with broad, general research into similar products and issues around safety and ethical concerns that have already been reported. For example, a team building a smart home device would do well to understand the multitude of ways that existing smart home devices have been used as tools of abuse. If your product will involve AI, seek to understand the potentials for racism and other issues that have been reported in existing AI products. Nearly all types of technology have some kind of potential or actual harm that’s been reported on in the news or written about by academics. Google Scholar is a useful tool for finding these studies.



Specific research: Survivors



When possible and appropriate, include direct research (surveys and interviews) with people who are experts in the forms of harm you have uncovered. Ideally, you’ll want to interview advocates working in the space of your research first so that you have a more solid understanding of the topic and are better equipped to not retraumatize survivors. If you’ve uncovered possible domestic violence issues, for example, the experts you’ll want to speak with are survivors themselves, as well as workers at domestic violence hotlines, shelters, other related nonprofits, and lawyers.



Especially when interviewing survivors of any kind of trauma, it is important to pay people for their knowledge and lived experiences. Don’t ask survivors to share their trauma for free, as this is exploitative. While some survivors may not want to be paid, you should always make the offer in the initial ask. An alternative to payment is to donate to an organization working against the type of violence that the interviewee experienced. We’ll talk more about how to appropriately interview survivors in Chapter 6.



Specific research: Abusers



It’s unlikely that teams aiming to design for safety will be able to interview self-proclaimed abusers or people who have broken laws around things like hacking. Don’t make this a goal; rather, try to get at this angle in your general research. Aim to understand how abusers or bad actors weaponize technology to use against others, how they cover their tracks, and how they explain or rationalize the abuse.



Step 2: Create archetypes



Once you’ve finished conducting your research, use your insights to create abuser and survivor archetypes. Archetypes are not personas, as they’re not based on real people that you interviewed and surveyed. Instead, they’re based on your research into likely safety issues, much like when we design for accessibility: we don’t need to have found a group of blind or low-vision users in our interview pool to create a design that’s inclusive of them. Instead, we base those designs on existing research into what this group needs. Personas typically represent real users and include many details, while archetypes are broader and can be more generalized.



The abuser archetype is someone who will look at the product as a tool to perform harm (Fig 5.2). They may be trying to harm someone they don’t know through surveillance or anonymous harassment, or they may be trying to control, monitor, abuse, or torment someone they know personally.



Fig 5.2: Harry Oleson, an abuser archetype for a fitness product, is looking for ways to stalk his ex-girlfriend through the fitness apps she uses.



The survivor archetype is someone who is being abused with the product. There are various situations to consider in terms of the archetype’s understanding of the abuse and how to put an end to it: Do they need proof of abuse they already suspect is happening, or are they unaware they’ve been targeted in the first place and need to be alerted (Fig 5.3)?



Fig 5.3: The survivor archetype Lisa Zwaan suspects her husband is weaponizing their home’s IoT devices against her, but in the face of his insistence that she simply doesn’t understand how to use the products, she’s unsure. She needs some kind of proof of the abuse.



You may want to make multiple survivor archetypes to capture a range of different experiences. They may know that the abuse is happening but not be able to stop it, like when an abuser locks them out of IoT devices; or they know it’s happening but don’t know how, such as when a stalker keeps figuring out their location (Fig 5.4). Include as many of these scenarios as you need to in your survivor archetype. You’ll use these later on when you design solutions to help your survivor archetypes achieve their goals of preventing and ending abuse.



Fig 5.4: The survivor archetype Eric Mitchell knows he’s being stalked by his ex-boyfriend Rob but can’t figure out how Rob is learning his location information.



It may be useful for you to create persona-like artifacts for your archetypes, such as the three examples shown. Instead of focusing on the demographic information we often see in personas, focus on their goals. The goals of the abuser will be to carry out the specific abuse you’ve identified, while the goals of the survivor will be to prevent abuse, understand that abuse is happening, make ongoing abuse stop, or regain control over the technology that’s being used for abuse. Later, you’ll brainstorm how to prevent the abuser’s goals and assist the survivor’s goals.



And while the “abuser/survivor” model fits most cases, it doesn’t fit all, so modify it as you need to. For example, if you uncovered an issue with security, such as the ability for someone to hack into a home camera system and talk to children, the malicious hacker would get the abuser archetype and the child’s parents would get survivor archetype.



Step 3: Brainstorm problems



After creating archetypes, brainstorm novel abuse cases and safety issues. “Novel” means things not found in your research; you’re trying to identify completely new safety issues that are unique to your product or service. The goal with this step is to exhaust every effort of identifying harms your product could cause. You aren’t worrying about how to prevent the harm yet—that comes in the next step.



How could your product be used for any kind of abuse, outside of what you’ve already identified in your research? I recommend setting aside at least a few hours with your team for this process.



If you’re looking for somewhere to start, try doing a Black Mirror brainstorm. This exercise is based on the show Black Mirror, which features stories about the dark possibilities of technology. Try to figure out how your product would be used in an episode of the show—the most wild, awful, out-of-control ways it could be used for harm. When I’ve led Black Mirror brainstorms, participants usually end up having a good deal of fun (which I think is great—it’s okay to have fun when designing for safety!). I recommend time-boxing a Black Mirror brainstorm to half an hour, and then dialing it back and using the rest of the time thinking of more realistic forms of harm.



After you’ve identified as many opportunities for abuse as possible, you may still not feel confident that you’ve uncovered every potential form of harm. A healthy amount of anxiety is normal when you’re doing this kind of work. It’s common for teams designing for safety to worry, “Have we really identified every possible harm? What if we’ve missed something?” If you’ve spent at least four hours coming up with ways your product could be used for harm and have run out of ideas, go to the next step.



It’s impossible to guarantee you’ve thought of everything; instead of aiming for 100 percent assurance, recognize that you’ve taken this time and have done the best you can, and commit to continuing to prioritize safety in the future. Once your product is released, your users may identify new issues that you missed; aim to receive that feedback graciously and course-correct quickly.



Step 4: Design solutions



At this point, you should have a list of ways your product can be used for harm as well as survivor and abuser archetypes describing opposing user goals. The next step is to identify ways to design against the identified abuser’s goals and to support the survivor’s goals. This step is a good one to insert alongside existing parts of your design process where you’re proposing solutions for the various problems your research uncovered.



Some questions to ask yourself to help prevent harm and support your archetypes include:



Can you design your product in such a way that the identified harm cannot happen in the first place? If not, what roadblocks can you put up to prevent the harm from happening?How can you make the victim aware that abuse is happening through your product?How can you help the victim understand what they need to do to make the problem stop?Can you identify any types of user activity that would indicate some form of harm or abuse? Could your product help the user access support?



In some products, it’s possible to proactively recognize that harm is happening. For example, a pregnancy app might be modified to allow the user to report that they were the victim of an assault, which could trigger an offer to receive resources for local and national organizations. This sort of proactiveness is not always possible, but it’s worth taking a half hour to discuss if any type of user activity would indicate some form of harm or abuse, and how your product could assist the user in receiving help in a safe manner.



That said, use caution: you don’t want to do anything that could put a user in harm’s way if their devices are being monitored. If you do offer some kind of proactive help, always make it voluntary, and think through other safety issues, such as the need to keep the user in-app in case an abuser is checking their search history. We’ll walk through a good example of this in the next chapter.



Step 5: Test for safety



The final step is to test your prototypes from the point of view of your archetypes: the person who wants to weaponize the product for harm and the victim of the harm who needs to regain control over the technology. Just like any other kind of product testing, at this point you’ll aim to rigorously test out your safety solutions so that you can identify gaps and correct them, validate that your designs will help keep your users safe, and feel more confident releasing your product into the world.



Ideally, safety testing happens along with usability testing. If you’re at a company that doesn’t do usability testing, you might be able to use safety testing to cleverly perform both; a user who goes through your design attempting to weaponize the product against someone else can also be encouraged to point out interactions or other elements of the design that don’t make sense to them.



You’ll want to conduct safety testing on either your final prototype or the actual product if it’s already been released. There’s nothing wrong with testing an existing product that wasn’t designed with safety goals in mind from the onset—“retrofitting” it for safety is a good thing to do.



Remember that testing for safety involves testing from the perspective of both an abuser and a survivor, though it may not make sense for you to do both. Alternatively, if you made multiple survivor archetypes to capture multiple scenarios, you’ll want to test from the perspective of each one.



As with other sorts of usability testing, you as the designer are most likely too close to the product and its design by this point to be a valuable tester; you know the product too well. Instead of doing it yourself, set up testing as you would with other usability testing: find someone who is not familiar with the product and its design, set the scene, give them a task, encourage them to think out loud, and observe how they attempt to complete it.



Abuser testing



The goal of this testing is to understand how easy it is for someone to weaponize your product for harm. Unlike with usability testing, you want to make it impossible, or at least difficult, for them to achieve their goal. Reference the goals in the abuser archetype you created earlier, and use your product in an attempt to achieve them.



For example, for a fitness app with GPS-enabled location features, we can imagine that the abuser archetype would have the goal of figuring out where his ex-girlfriend now lives. With this goal in mind, you’d try everything possible to figure out the location of another user who has their privacy settings enabled. You might try to see her running routes, view any available information on her profile, view anything available about her location (which she has set to private), and investigate the profiles of any other users somehow connected with her account, such as her followers.



If by the end of this you’ve managed to uncover some of her location data, despite her having set her profile to private, you know now that your product enables stalking. Your next step is to go back to step 4 and figure out how to prevent this from happening. You may need to repeat the process of designing solutions and testing them more than once.



Survivor testing



Survivor testing involves identifying how to give information and power to the survivor. It might not always make sense based on the product or context. Thwarting the attempt of an abuser archetype to stalk someone also satisfies the goal of the survivor archetype to not be stalked, so separate testing wouldn’t be needed from the survivor’s perspective.



However, there are cases where it makes sense. For example, for a smart thermostat, a survivor archetype’s goals would be to understand who or what is making the temperature change when they aren’t doing it themselves. You could test this by looking for the thermostat’s history log and checking for usernames, actions, and times; if you couldn’t find that information, you would have more work to do in step 4.



Another goal might be regaining control of the thermostat once the survivor realizes the abuser is remotely changing its settings. Your test would involve attempting to figure out how to do this: are there instructions that explain how to remove another user and change the password, and are they easy to find? This might again reveal that more work is needed to make it clear to the user how they can regain control of the device or account.



Stress testing



To make your product more inclusive and compassionate, consider adding stress testing. This concept comes from Design for Real Life by Eric Meyer and Sara Wachter-Boettcher. The authors pointed out that personas typically center people who are having a good day—but real users are often anxious, stressed out, having a bad day, or even experiencing tragedy. These are called “stress cases,” and testing your products for users in stress-case situations can help you identify places where your design lacks compassion. Design for Real Life has more details about what it looks like to incorporate stress cases into your design as well as many other great tactics for compassionate design.

    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">In the 1950s, many in the elite running community had begun to believe it wasn’t possible to run a mile in less than four minutes. Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. 



But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 



This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian runner John Landy. Then a year later, three runners all beat the four-minute barrier together in the same race. Since then, over 1,400 runners have officially run a mile in under four minutes; the current record is 3:43.13, held by Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj.



We achieve far more when we believe that something is possible, and we will believe it’s possible only when we see someone else has already done it—and as with human running speed, so it is with what we believe are the hard limits for how a website needs to perform.



Establishing standards for a sustainable web



In most major industries, the key metrics of environmental performance are fairly well established, such as miles per gallon for cars or energy per square meter for homes. The tools and methods for calculating those metrics are standardized as well, which keeps everyone on the same page when doing environmental assessments. In the world of websites and apps, however, we aren’t held to any particular environmental standards, and only recently have gained the tools and methods we need to even make an environmental assessment.



The primary goal in sustainable web design is to reduce carbon emissions. However, it’s almost impossible to actually measure the amount of CO2 produced by a web product. We can’t measure the fumes coming out of the exhaust pipes on our laptops. The emissions of our websites are far away, out of sight and out of mind, coming out of power stations burning coal and gas. We have no way to trace the electrons from a website or app back to the power station where the electricity is being generated and actually know the exact amount of greenhouse gas produced. So what do we do? 



If we can’t measure the actual carbon emissions, then we need to find what we can measure. The primary factors that could be used as indicators of carbon emissions are:



Data transfer Carbon intensity of electricity



Let’s take a look at how we can use these metrics to quantify the energy consumption, and in turn the carbon footprint, of the websites and web apps we create.



Data transfer



Most researchers use kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh/GB) as a metric of energy efficiency when measuring the amount of data transferred over the internet when a website or application is used. This provides a great reference point for energy consumption and carbon emissions. As a rule of thumb, the more data transferred, the more energy used in the data center, telecoms networks, and end user devices.



For web pages, data transfer for a single visit can be most easily estimated by measuring the page weight, meaning the transfer size of the page in kilobytes the first time someone visits the page. It’s fairly easy to measure using the developer tools in any modern web browser. Often your web hosting account will include statistics for the total data transfer of any web application (Fig 2.1).



Fig 2.1: The Kinsta hosting dashboard displays data transfer alongside traffic volumes. If you divide data transfer by visits, you get the average data per visit, which can be used as a metric of efficiency.



The nice thing about page weight as a metric is that it allows us to compare the efficiency of web pages on a level playing field without confusing the issue with constantly changing traffic volumes. 



Reducing page weight requires a large scope. By early 2020, the median page weight was 1.97 MB for setups the HTTP Archive classifies as “desktop” and 1.77 MB for “mobile,” with desktop increasing 36 percent since January 2016 and mobile page weights nearly doubling in the same period (Fig 2.2). Roughly half of this data transfer is image files, making images the single biggest source of carbon emissions on the average website. 



History clearly shows us that our web pages can be smaller, if only we set our minds to it. While most technologies become ever more energy efficient, including the underlying technology of the web such as data centers and transmission networks, websites themselves are a technology that becomes less efficient as time goes on.



Fig 2.2: The historical page weight data from HTTP Archive can teach us a lot about what is possible in the future.



You might be familiar with the concept of performance budgeting as a way of focusing a project team on creating faster user experiences. For example, we might specify that the website must load in a maximum of one second on a broadband connection and three seconds on a 3G connection. Much like speed limits while driving, performance budgets are upper limits rather than vague suggestions, so the goal should always be to come in under budget.



Designing for fast performance does often lead to reduced data transfer and emissions, but it isn’t always the case. Web performance is often more about the subjective perception of load times than it is about the true efficiency of the underlying system, whereas page weight and transfer size are more objective measures and more reliable benchmarks for sustainable web design. 



We can set a page weight budget in reference to a benchmark of industry averages, using data from sources like HTTP Archive. We can also benchmark page weight against competitors or the old version of the website we’re replacing. For example, we might set a maximum page weight budget as equal to our most efficient competitor, or we could set the benchmark lower to guarantee we are best in class. 



If we want to take it to the next level, then we could also start looking at the transfer size of our web pages for repeat visitors. Although page weight for the first time someone visits is the easiest thing to measure, and easy to compare on a like-for-like basis, we can learn even more if we start looking at transfer size in other scenarios too. For example, visitors who load the same page multiple times will likely have a high percentage of the files cached in their browser, meaning they don’t need to transfer all of the files on subsequent visits. Likewise, a visitor who navigates to new pages on the same website will likely not need to load the full page each time, as some global assets from areas like the header and footer may already be cached in their browser. Measuring transfer size at this next level of detail can help us learn even more about how we can optimize efficiency for users who regularly visit our pages, and enable us to set page weight budgets for additional scenarios beyond the first visit.



Page weight budgets are easy to track throughout a design and development process. Although they don’t actually tell us carbon emission and energy consumption analytics directly, they give us a clear indication of efficiency relative to other websites. And as transfer size is an effective analog for energy consumption, we can actually use it to estimate energy consumption too.



In summary, reduced data transfer translates to energy efficiency, a key factor to reducing carbon emissions of web products. The more efficient our products, the less electricity they use, and the less fossil fuels need to be burned to produce the electricity to power them. But as we’ll see next, since all web products demand some power, it’s important to consider the source of that electricity, too.



Carbon intensity of electricity



Regardless of energy efficiency, the level of pollution caused by digital products depends on the carbon intensity of the energy being used to power them. Carbon intensity is a term used to define the grams of CO2 produced for every kilowatt-hour of electricity (gCO2/kWh). This varies widely, with renewable energy sources and nuclear having an extremely low carbon intensity of less than 10 gCO2/kWh (even when factoring in their construction); whereas fossil fuels have very high carbon intensity of approximately 200–400 gCO2/kWh. 



Most electricity comes from national or state grids, where energy from a variety of different sources is mixed together with varying levels of carbon intensity. The distributed nature of the internet means that a single user of a website or app might be using energy from multiple different grids simultaneously; a website user in Paris uses electricity from the French national grid to power their home internet and devices, but the website’s data center could be in Dallas, USA, pulling electricity from the Texas grid, while the telecoms networks use energy from everywhere between Dallas and Paris.



We don’t have control over the full energy supply of web services, but we do have some control over where we host our projects. With a data center using a significant proportion of the energy of any website, locating the data center in an area with low carbon energy will tangibly reduce its carbon emissions. Danish startup Tomorrow reports and maps this user-contributed data, and a glance at their map shows how, for example, choosing a data center in France will have significantly lower carbon emissions than a data center in the Netherlands (Fig 2.3).



Fig 2.3: Tomorrow’s electricityMap shows live data for the carbon intensity of electricity by country.



That said, we don’t want to locate our servers too far away from our users; it takes energy to transmit data through the telecom’s networks, and the further the data travels, the more energy is consumed. Just like food miles, we can think of the distance from the data center to the website’s core user base as “megabyte miles”—and we want it to be as small as possible.



Using the distance itself as a benchmark, we can use website analytics to identify the country, state, or even city where our core user group is located and measure the distance from that location to the data center used by our hosting company. This will be a somewhat fuzzy metric as we don’t know the precise center of mass of our users or the exact location of a data center, but we can at least get a rough idea. 



For example, if a website is hosted in London but the primary user base is on the West Coast of the USA, then we could look up the distance from London to San Francisco, which is 5,300 miles. That’s a long way! We can see that hosting it somewhere in North America, ideally on the West Coast, would significantly reduce the distance and thus the energy used to transmit the data. In addition, locating our servers closer to our visitors helps reduce latency and delivers better user experience, so it’s a win-win.



Converting it back to carbon emissions



If we combine carbon intensity with a calculation for energy consumption, we can calculate the carbon emissions of our websites and apps. A tool my team created does this by measuring the data transfer over the wire when loading a web page, calculating the amount of electricity associated, and then converting that into a figure for CO2 (Fig 2.4). It also factors in whether or not the web hosting is powered by renewable energy.



If you want to take it to the next level and tailor the data more accurately to the unique aspects of your project, the Energy and Emissions Worksheet accompanying this book shows you how.



Fig 2.4: The Website Carbon Calculator shows how the Riverford Organic website embodies their commitment to sustainability, being both low carbon and hosted in a data center using renewable energy.



With the ability to calculate carbon emissions for our projects, we could actually take a page weight budget one step further and set carbon budgets as well. CO2 is not a metric commonly used in web projects; we’re more familiar with kilobytes and megabytes, and can fairly easily look at design options and files to assess how big they are. Translating that into carbon adds a layer of abstraction that isn’t as intuitive—but carbon budgets do focus our minds on the primary thing we’re trying to reduce, and support the core objective of sustainable web design: reducing carbon emissions.



Browser Energy



Data transfer might be the simplest and most complete analog for energy consumption in our digital projects, but by giving us one number to represent the energy used in the data center, the telecoms networks, and the end user’s devices, it can’t offer us insights into the efficiency in any specific part of the system.



One part of the system we can look at in more detail is the energy used by end users’ devices. As front-end web technologies become more advanced, the computational load is increasingly moving from the data center to users’ devices, whether they be phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, or even smart TVs. Modern web browsers allow us to implement more complex styling and animation on the fly using CSS and JavaScript. Furthermore, JavaScript libraries such as Angular and React allow us to create applications where the “thinking” work is done partly or entirely in the browser. 



All of these advances are exciting and open up new possibilities for what the web can do to serve society and create positive experiences. However, more computation in the user’s web browser means more energy used by their devices. This has implications not just environmentally, but also for user experience and inclusivity. Applications that put a heavy processing load on the user’s device can inadvertently exclude users with older, slower devices and cause batteries on phones and laptops to drain faster. Furthermore, if we build web applications that require the user to have up-to-date, powerful devices, people throw away old devices much more frequently. This isn’t just bad for the environment, but it puts a disproportionate financial burden on the poorest in society.



In part because the tools are limited, and partly because there are so many different models of devices, it’s difficult to measure website energy consumption on end users’ devices. One tool we do currently have is the Energy Impact monitor inside the developer console of the Safari browser (Fig 2.5).



Fig 2.5: The Energy Impact meter in Safari (on the right) shows how a website consumes CPU energy.



You know when you load a website and your computer’s cooling fans start spinning so frantically you think it might actually take off? That’s essentially what this tool is measuring. 



It shows us the percentage of CPU used and the duration of CPU usage when loading the web page, and uses these figures to generate an energy impact rating. It doesn’t give us precise data for the amount of electricity used in kilowatts, but the information it does provide can be used to benchmark how efficiently your websites use energy and set targets for improvement.

    <p class="article__summary">We’ve been having conversations for thousands of years. Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.



Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, and the variations in word choice and spoken dialect that can stymie even the most carefully crafted human-computer interaction. In the human-to-human scenario, spoken language also has the privilege of face-to-face contact, where we can readily interpret nonverbal social cues.



In contrast, written language immediately concretizes as we commit it to record and retains usages long after they become obsolete in spoken communication (the salutation “To whom it may concern,” for example), generating its own fossil record of outdated terms and phrases. Because it tends to be more consistent, polished, and formal, written text is fundamentally much easier for machines to parse and understand.



Spoken language has no such luxury. Besides the nonverbal cues that decorate conversations with emphasis and emotional context, there are also verbal cues and vocal behaviors that modulate conversation in nuanced ways: how something is said, not what. Whether rapid-fire, low-pitched, or high-decibel, whether sarcastic, stilted, or sighing, our spoken language conveys much more than the written word could ever muster. So when it comes to voice interfaces—the machines we conduct spoken conversations with—we face exciting challenges as designers and content strategists.



Voice Interactions



We interact with voice interfaces for a variety of reasons, but according to Michael McTear, Zoraida Callejas, and David Griol in The Conversational Interface, those motivations by and large mirror the reasons we initiate conversations with other people, too (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-01). Generally, we start up a conversation because:



we need something done (such as a transaction),we want to know something (information of some sort), orwe are social beings and want someone to talk to (conversation for conversation’s sake).



These three categories—which I call transactional, informational, and prosocial—also characterize essentially every voice interaction: a single conversation from beginning to end that realizes some outcome for the user, starting with the voice interface’s first greeting and ending with the user exiting the interface. Note here that a conversation in our human sense—a chat between people that leads to some result and lasts an arbitrary length of time—could encompass multiple transactional, informational, and prosocial voice interactions in succession. In other words, a voice interaction is a conversation, but a conversation is not necessarily a single voice interaction.



Purely prosocial conversations are more gimmicky than captivating in most voice interfaces, because machines don’t yet have the capacity to really want to know how we’re doing and to do the sort of glad-handing humans crave. There’s also ongoing debate as to whether users actually prefer the sort of organic human conversation that begins with a prosocial voice interaction and shifts seamlessly into other types. In fact, in Voice User Interface Design, Michael Cohen, James Giangola, and Jennifer Balogh recommend sticking to users’ expectations by mimicking how they interact with other voice interfaces rather than trying too hard to be human—potentially alienating them in the process (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-01).



That leaves two genres of conversations we can have with one another that a voice interface can easily have with us, too: a transactional voice interaction realizing some outcome (“buy iced tea”) and an informational voice interaction teaching us something new (“discuss a musical”).



Transactional voice interactions



Unless you’re tapping buttons on a food delivery app, you’re generally having a conversation—and therefore a voice interaction—when you order a Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapple. Even when we walk up to the counter and place an order, the conversation quickly pivots from an initial smattering of neighborly small talk to the real mission at hand: ordering a pizza (generously topped with pineapple, as it should be).



Alison: Hey, how’s it going?Burhan: Hi, welcome to Crust Deluxe! It’s cold out there. How can I help you?Alison: Can I get a Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapple?Burhan: Sure, what size?Alison: Large.Burhan: Anything else?Alison: No thanks, that’s it.Burhan: Something to drink?Alison: I’ll have a bottle of Coke.Burhan: You got it. That’ll be $13.55 and about fifteen minutes.



Each progressive disclosure in this transactional conversation reveals more and more of the desired outcome of the transaction: a service rendered or a product delivered. Transactional conversations have certain key traits: they’re direct, to the point, and economical. They quickly dispense with pleasantries.



Informational voice interactions



Meanwhile, some conversations are primarily about obtaining information. Though Alison might visit Crust Deluxe with the sole purpose of placing an order, she might not actually want to walk out with a pizza at all. She might be just as interested in whether they serve halal or kosher dishes, gluten-free options, or something else. Here, though we again have a prosocial mini-conversation at the beginning to establish politeness, we’re after much more.



Alison: Hey, how’s it going?Burhan: Hi, welcome to Crust Deluxe! It’s cold out there. How can I help you?Alison: Can I ask a few questions?Burhan: Of course! Go right ahead.Alison: Do you have any halal options on the menu?Burhan: Absolutely! We can make any pie halal by request. We also have lots of vegetarian, ovo-lacto, and vegan options. Are you thinking about any other dietary restrictions?Alison: What about gluten-free pizzas?Burhan: We can definitely do a gluten-free crust for you, no problem, for both our deep-dish and thin-crust pizzas. Anything else I can answer for you?Alison: That’s it for now. Good to know. Thanks!Burhan: Anytime, come back soon!



This is a very different dialogue. Here, the goal is to get a certain set of facts. Informational conversations are investigative quests for the truth—research expeditions to gather data, news, or facts. Voice interactions that are informational might be more long-winded than transactional conversations by necessity. Responses tend to be lengthier, more informative, and carefully communicated so the customer understands the key takeaways.



Voice Interfaces



At their core, voice interfaces employ speech to support users in reaching their goals. But simply because an interface has a voice component doesn’t mean that every user interaction with it is mediated through voice. Because multimodal voice interfaces can lean on visual components like screens as crutches, we’re most concerned in this book with pure voice interfaces, which depend entirely on spoken conversation, lack any visual component whatsoever, and are therefore much more nuanced and challenging to tackle.



Though voice interfaces have long been integral to the imagined future of humanity in science fiction, only recently have those lofty visions become fully realized in genuine voice interfaces.



Interactive voice response (IVR) systems



Though written conversational interfaces have been fixtures of computing for many decades, voice interfaces first emerged in the early 1990s with text-to-speech (TTS) dictation programs that recited written text aloud, as well as speech-enabled in-car systems that gave directions to a user-provided address. With the advent of interactive voice response (IVR) systems, intended as an alternative to overburdened customer service representatives, we became acquainted with the first true voice interfaces that engaged in authentic conversation.



IVR systems allowed organizations to reduce their reliance on call centers but soon became notorious for their clunkiness. Commonplace in the corporate world, these systems were primarily designed as metaphorical switchboards to guide customers to a real phone agent (“Say Reservations to book a flight or check an itinerary”); chances are you will enter a conversation with one when you call an airline or hotel conglomerate. Despite their functional issues and users’ frustration with their inability to speak to an actual human right away, IVR systems proliferated in the early 1990s across a variety of industries (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-02, PDF).



While IVR systems are great for highly repetitive, monotonous conversations that generally don’t veer from a single format, they have a reputation for less scintillating conversation than we’re used to in real life (or even in science fiction).



Screen readers



Parallel to the evolution of IVR systems was the invention of the screen reader, a tool that transcribes visual content into synthesized speech. For Blind or visually impaired website users, it’s the predominant method of interacting with text, multimedia, or form elements. Screen readers represent perhaps the closest equivalent we have today to an out-of-the-box implementation of content delivered through voice.



Among the first screen readers known by that moniker was the Screen Reader for the BBC Micro and NEEC Portable developed by the Research Centre for the Education of the Visually Handicapped (RCEVH) at the University of Birmingham in 1986 (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-03). That same year, Jim Thatcher created the first IBM Screen Reader for text-based computers, later recreated for computers with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-04).



With the rapid growth of the web in the 1990s, the demand for accessible tools for websites exploded. Thanks to the introduction of semantic HTML and especially ARIA roles beginning in 2008, screen readers started facilitating speedy interactions with web pages that ostensibly allow disabled users to traverse the page as an aural and temporal space rather than a visual and physical one. In other words, screen readers for the web “provide mechanisms that translate visual design constructs—proximity, proportion, etc.—into useful information,” writes Aaron Gustafson in A List Apart. “At least they do when documents are authored thoughtfully” (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-05).



Though deeply instructive for voice interface designers, there’s one significant problem with screen readers: they’re difficult to use and unremittingly verbose. The visual structures of websites and web navigation don’t translate well to screen readers, sometimes resulting in unwieldy pronouncements that name every manipulable HTML element and announce every formatting change. For many screen reader users, working with web-based interfaces exacts a cognitive toll.



In Wired, accessibility advocate and voice engineer Chris Maury considers why the screen reader experience is ill-suited to users relying on voice:



From the beginning, I hated the way that Screen Readers work. Why are they designed the way they are? It makes no sense to present information visually and then, and only then, translate that into audio. All of the time and energy that goes into creating the perfect user experience for an app is wasted, or even worse, adversely impacting the experience for blind users. (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-06)



In many cases, well-designed voice interfaces can speed users to their destination better than long-winded screen reader monologues. After all, visual interface users have the benefit of darting around the viewport freely to find information, ignoring areas irrelevant to them. Blind users, meanwhile, are obligated to listen to every utterance synthesized into speech and therefore prize brevity and efficiency. Disabled users who have long had no choice but to employ clunky screen readers may find that voice interfaces, particularly more modern voice assistants, offer a more streamlined experience.



Voice assistants



When we think of voice assistants (the subset of voice interfaces now commonplace in living rooms, smart homes, and offices), many of us immediately picture HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey or hear Majel Barrett’s voice as the omniscient computer in Star Trek. Voice assistants are akin to personal concierges that can answer questions, schedule appointments, conduct searches, and perform other common day-to-day tasks. And they’re rapidly gaining more attention from accessibility advocates for their assistive potential.



Before the earliest IVR systems found success in the enterprise, Apple published a demonstration video in 1987 depicting the Knowledge Navigator, a voice assistant that could transcribe spoken words and recognize human speech to a great degree of accuracy. Then, in 2001, Tim Berners-Lee and others formulated their vision for a Semantic Web “agent” that would perform typical errands like “checking calendars, making appointments, and finding locations” (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-07, behind paywall). It wasn’t until 2011 that Apple’s Siri finally entered the picture, making voice assistants a tangible reality for consumers.



Thanks to the plethora of voice assistants available today, there is considerable variation in how programmable and customizable certain voice assistants are over others (Fig 1.1). At one extreme, everything except vendor-provided features is locked down; for example, at the time of their release, the core functionality of Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana couldn’t be extended beyond their existing capabilities. Even today, it isn’t possible to program Siri to perform arbitrary functions, because there’s no means by which developers can interact with Siri at a low level, apart from predefined categories of tasks like sending messages, hailing rideshares, making restaurant reservations, and certain others.



At the opposite end of the spectrum, voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home offer a core foundation on which developers can build custom voice interfaces. For this reason, programmable voice assistants that lend themselves to customization and extensibility are becoming increasingly popular for developers who feel stifled by the limitations of Siri and Cortana. Amazon offers the Alexa Skills Kit, a developer framework for building custom voice interfaces for Amazon Alexa, while Google Home offers the ability to program arbitrary Google Assistant skills. Today, users can choose from among thousands of custom-built skills within both the Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant ecosystems.



Fig 1.1: Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home tend to be more programmable, and thus more flexible, than their counterpart Apple Siri.



As corporations like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google continue to stake their territory, they’re also selling and open-sourcing an unprecedented array of tools and frameworks for designers and developers that aim to make building voice interfaces as easy as possible, even without code.



Often by necessity, voice assistants like Amazon Alexa tend to be monochannel—they’re tightly coupled to a device and can’t be accessed on a computer or smartphone instead. By contrast, many development platforms like Google’s Dialogflow have introduced omnichannel capabilities so users can build a single conversational interface that then manifests as a voice interface, textual chatbot, and IVR system upon deployment. I don’t prescribe any specific implementation approaches in this design-focused book, but in Chapter 4 we’ll get into some of the implications these variables might have on the way you build out your design artifacts.



Voice Content



Simply put, voice content is content delivered through voice. To preserve what makes human conversation so compelling in the first place, voice content needs to be free-flowing and organic, contextless and concise—everything written content isn’t.



Our world is replete with voice content in various forms: screen readers reciting website content, voice assistants rattling off a weather forecast, and automated phone hotline responses governed by IVR systems. In this book, we’re most concerned with content delivered auditorily—not as an option, but as a necessity.



For many of us, our first foray into informational voice interfaces will be to deliver content to users. There’s only one problem: any content we already have isn’t in any way ready for this new habitat. So how do we make the content trapped on our websites more conversational? And how do we write new copy that lends itself to voice interactions?



Lately, we’ve begun slicing and dicing our content in unprecedented ways. Websites are, in many respects, colossal vaults of what I call macrocontent: lengthy prose that can extend for infinitely scrollable miles in a browser window, like microfilm viewers of newspaper archives. Back in 2002, well before the present-day ubiquity of voice assistants, technologist Anil Dash defined microcontent as permalinked pieces of content that stay legible regardless of environment, such as email or text messages:



A day’s weather forcast [sic], the arrival and departure times for an airplane flight, an abstract from a long publication, or a single instant message can all be examples of microcontent. (http://bkaprt.com/vcu36/01-08)



I’d update Dash’s definition of microcontent to include all examples of bite-sized content that go well beyond written communiqués. After all, today we encounter microcontent in interfaces where a small snippet of copy is displayed alone, unmoored from the browser, like a textbot confirmation of a restaurant reservation. Microcontent offers the best opportunity to gauge how your content can be stretched to the very edges of its capabilities, informing delivery channels both established and novel.



As microcontent, voice content is unique because it’s an example of how content is experienced in time rather than in space. We can glance at a digital sign underground for an instant and know when the next train is arriving, but voice interfaces hold our attention captive for periods of time that we can’t easily escape or skip, something screen reader users are all too familiar with.



Because microcontent is fundamentally made up of isolated blobs with no relation to the channels where they’ll eventually end up, we need to ensure that our microcontent truly performs well as voice content—and that means focusing on the two most important traits of robust voice content: voice content legibility and voice content discoverability.



Fundamentally, the legibility and discoverability of our voice content both have to do with how voice content manifests in perceived time and space.

    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">I’m not sure when I first heard this quote, but it’s something that has stayed with me over the years. How do you create services for situations you can’t imagine? Or design products that work on devices yet to be invented?



Flash, Photoshop, and responsive design



When I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.



Ethan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs full of magic numbers that I had previously prided myself on producing were no longer good enough.



The fear wasn’t helped by my first experience with responsive design. My first project was to take an existing fixed-width website and make it responsive. What I learned the hard way was that you can’t just add responsiveness at the end of a project. To create fluid layouts, you need to plan throughout the design phase.



A new way to design



Designing responsive or fluid sites has always been about removing limitations, producing content that can be viewed on any device. It relies on the use of percentage-based layouts, which I initially achieved with native CSS and utility classes:



.column-span-6 {
  width: 49%;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 0.5%;
  margin-left: 0.5%;
}


.column-span-4 {
  width: 32%;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 0.5%;
  margin-left: 0.5%;
}

.column-span-3 {
  width: 24%;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 0.5%;
  margin-left: 0.5%;
}



Then with Sass so I could take advantage of @includes to re-use repeated blocks of code and move back to more semantic markup:



.logo {
  @include colSpan(6);
}

.search {
  @include colSpan(3);
}

.social-share {
  @include colSpan(3);
}



Media queries



The second ingredient for responsive design is media queries. Without them, content would shrink to fit the available space regardless of whether that content remained readable (The exact opposite problem occurred with the introduction of a mobile-first approach).



Components becoming too small at mobile breakpoints



Media queries prevented this by allowing us to add breakpoints where the design could adapt. Like most people, I started out with three breakpoints: one for desktop, one for tablets, and one for mobile. Over the years, I added more and more for phablets, wide screens, and so on. 



For years, I happily worked this way and improved both my design and front-end skills in the process. The only problem I encountered was making changes to content, since with our Sass grid system in place, there was no way for the site owners to add content without amending the markup—something a small business owner might struggle with. This is because each row in the grid was defined using a div as a container. Adding content meant creating new row markup, which requires a level of HTML knowledge.



Row markup was a staple of early responsive design, present in all the widely used frameworks like Bootstrap and Skeleton.



&lt;section class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;1 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;2 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;3 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;4 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;5 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;6 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column-span-4&quot;&gt;7 of 7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;



Components placed in the rows of a Sass grid



Another problem arose as I moved from a design agency building websites for small- to medium-sized businesses, to larger in-house teams where I worked across a suite of related sites. In those roles I started to work much more with reusable components. 



Our reliance on media queries resulted in components that were tied to common viewport sizes. If the goal of component libraries is reuse, then this is a real problem because you can only use these components if the devices you’re designing for correspond to the viewport sizes used in the pattern library—in the process not really hitting that “devices that don’t yet exist”  goal.



Then there’s the problem of space. Media queries allow components to adapt based on the viewport size, but what if I put a component into a sidebar, like in the figure below?



Components responding to the viewport width with media queries



Container queries: our savior or a false dawn?



Container queries have long been touted as an improvement upon media queries, but at the time of writing are unsupported in most browsers. There are JavaScript workarounds, but they can create dependency and compatibility issues. The basic theory underlying container queries is that elements should change based on the size of their parent container and not the viewport width, as seen in the following illustrations.



Components responding to their parent container with container queries



One of the biggest arguments in favor of container queries is that they help us create components or design patterns that are truly reusable because they can be picked up and placed anywhere in a layout. This is an important step in moving toward a form of component-based design that works at any size on any device.



In other words, responsive components to replace responsive layouts.



Container queries will help us move from designing pages that respond to the browser or device size to designing components that can be placed in a sidebar or in the main content, and respond accordingly.



My concern is that we are still using layout to determine when a design needs to adapt. This approach will always be restrictive, as we will still need pre-defined breakpoints. For this reason, my main question with container queries is, How would we decide when to change the CSS used by a component? 



A component library removed from context and real content is probably not the best place for that decision. 



As the diagrams below illustrate, we can use container queries to create designs for specific container widths, but what if I want to change the design based on the image size or ratio?



Cards responding to their parent container with container queries



Cards responding based on their own content



In this example, the dimensions of the container are not what should dictate the design; rather, the image is.



It’s hard to say for sure whether container queries will be a success story until we have solid cross-browser support for them. Responsive component libraries would definitely evolve how we design and would improve the possibilities for reuse and design at scale. But maybe we will always need to adjust these components to suit our content.



CSS is changing



Whilst the container query debate rumbles on, there have been numerous advances in CSS that change the way we think about design. The days of fixed-width elements measured in pixels and floated div elements used to cobble layouts together are long gone, consigned to history along with table layouts. Flexbox and CSS Grid have revolutionized layouts for the web. We can now create elements that wrap onto new rows when they run out of space, not when the device changes.



.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 450px);
  gap: 10px;
}



The repeat() function paired with auto-fit or auto-fill allows us to specify how much space each column should use while leaving it up to the browser to decide when to spill the columns onto a new line. Similar things can be achieved with Flexbox, as elements can wrap over multiple rows and “flex” to fill available space. 



.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.child {
  flex-basis: 32%;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}



The biggest benefit of all this is you don’t need to wrap elements in container rows. Without rows, content isn’t tied to page markup in quite the same way, allowing for removals or additions of content without additional development.



A traditional Grid layout without the usual row containers



This is a big step forward when it comes to creating designs that allow for evolving content, but the real game changer for flexible designs is CSS Subgrid. 



Remember the days of crafting perfectly aligned interfaces, only for the customer to add an unbelievably long header almost as soon as they&#039;re given CMS access, like the illustration below?



Cards unable to respond to a sibling’s content changes



Subgrid allows elements to respond to adjustments in their own content and in the content of sibling elements, helping us create designs more resilient to change.



Cards responding to content in sibling cards



.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));
     grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  gap: 10px;
}

.sub-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-row: span 3;
  grid-template-rows: subgrid; /* sets rows to parent grid */
}



CSS Grid allows us to separate layout and content, thereby enabling flexible designs. Meanwhile, Subgrid allows us to create designs that can adapt in order to suit morphing content. Subgrid at the time of writing is only supported in Firefox but the above code can be implemented behind an @supports feature query. 



Intrinsic layouts 



I’d be remiss not to mention intrinsic layouts, the term created by Jen Simmons to describe a mixture of new and old CSS features used to create layouts that respond to available space. 



Responsive layouts have flexible columns using percentages. Intrinsic layouts, on the other hand, use the fr unit to create flexible columns that won’t ever shrink so much that they render the content illegible.



fr units is a way to say I want you to distribute the extra space in this way, but...don’t ever make it smaller than the content that’s inside of it.



—Jen Simmons, “Designing Intrinsic Layouts”



Intrinsic layouts can also utilize a mixture of fixed and flexible units, allowing the content to dictate the space it takes up.



Slide from “Designing Intrinsic Layouts” by Jen Simmons



What makes intrinsic design stand out is that it not only creates designs that can withstand future devices but also helps scale design without losing flexibility. Components and patterns can be lifted and reused without the prerequisite of having the same breakpoints or the same amount of content as in the previous implementation. 



We can now create designs that adapt to the space they have, the content within them, and the content around them. With an intrinsic approach, we can construct responsive components without depending on container queries.



Another 2010 moment?



This intrinsic approach should in my view be every bit as groundbreaking as responsive web design was ten years ago. For me, it’s another “everything changed” moment. 



But it doesn’t seem to be moving quite as fast; I haven’t yet had that same career-changing moment I had with responsive design, despite the widely shared and brilliant talk that brought it to my attention. 



One reason for that could be that I now work in a large organization, which is quite different from the design agency role I had in 2010. In my agency days, every new project was a clean slate, a chance to try something new. Nowadays, projects use existing tools and frameworks and are often improvements to existing websites with an existing codebase. 



Another could be that I feel more prepared for change now. In 2010 I was new to design in general; the shift was frightening and required a lot of learning. Also, an intrinsic approach isn’t exactly all-new; it’s about using existing skills and existing CSS knowledge in a different way. 



You can’t framework your way out of a content problem



Another reason for the slightly slower adoption of intrinsic design could be the lack of quick-fix framework solutions available to kick-start the change. 



Responsive grid systems were all over the place ten years ago. With a framework like Bootstrap or Skeleton, you had a responsive design template at your fingertips.



Intrinsic design and frameworks do not go hand in hand quite so well because the benefit of having a selection of units is a hindrance when it comes to creating layout templates. The beauty of intrinsic design is combining different units and experimenting with techniques to get the best for your content.



And then there are design tools. We probably all, at some point in our careers, used Photoshop templates for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices to drop designs in and show how the site would look at all three stages.



How do you do that now, with each component responding to content and layouts flexing as and when they need to? This type of design must happen in the browser, which personally I’m a big fan of. 



The debate about “whether designers should code” is another that has rumbled on for years. When designing a digital product, we should, at the very least, design for a best- and worst-case scenario when it comes to content. To do this in a graphics-based software package is far from ideal. In code, we can add longer sentences, more radio buttons, and extra tabs, and watch in real time as the design adapts. Does it still work? Is the design too reliant on the current content?



Personally, I look forward to the day intrinsic design is the standard for design, when a design component can be truly flexible and adapt to both its space and content with no reliance on device or container dimensions.



Content first 



Content is not constant. After all, to design for the unknown or unexpected we need to account for content changes like our earlier Subgrid card example that allowed the cards to respond to adjustments to their own content and the content of sibling elements.



Thankfully, there’s more to CSS than layout, and plenty of properties and values can help us put content first. Subgrid and pseudo-elements like ::first-line and ::first-letter help to separate design from markup so we can create designs that allow for changes.



Instead of old markup hacks like this—



&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;first-line&quot;&gt;First line of text with different styling&lt;/span&gt;...
&lt;/p&gt;



—we can target content based on where it appears.



.element::first-line {
  font-size: 1.4em;
}

.element::first-letter {
  color: red;
}



Much bigger additions to CSS include logical properties, which change the way we construct designs using logical dimensions (start and end) instead of physical ones (left and right), something CSS Grid also does with functions like min(), max(), and clamp().



This flexibility allows for directional changes according to content, a common requirement when we need to present content in multiple languages. In the past, this was often achieved with Sass mixins but was often limited to switching from left-to-right to right-to-left orientation.



In the Sass version, directional variables need to be set.



$direction: rtl;
$opposite-direction: ltr;

$start-direction: right;
$end-direction: left;



These variables can be used as values—



body {
  direction: $direction;
  text-align: $start-direction;
}



—or as properties.



margin-#{$end-direction}: 10px;
padding-#{$start-direction}: 10px;



However, now we have native logical properties, removing the reliance on both Sass (or a similar tool) and pre-planning that necessitated using variables throughout a codebase. These properties also start to break apart the tight coupling between a design and strict physical dimensions, creating more flexibility for changes in language and in direction.



margin-block-end: 10px;
padding-block-start: 10px;



There are also native start and end values for properties like text-align, which means we can replace text-align: right with text-align: start.



Like the earlier examples, these properties help to build out designs that aren’t constrained to one language; the design will reflect the content’s needs.







Fixed and fluid 



We briefly covered the power of combining fixed widths with fluid widths with intrinsic layouts. The min() and max() functions are a similar concept, allowing you to specify a fixed value with a flexible alternative. 



For min() this means setting a fluid minimum value and a maximum fixed value.



.element {
  width: min(50%, 300px);
}







The element in the figure above will be 50% of its container as long as the element’s width doesn’t exceed 300px.



For max() we can set a flexible max value and a minimum fixed value.



.element {
  width: max(50%, 300px);
}







Now the element will be 50% of its container as long as the element’s width is at least 300px. This means we can set limits but allow content to react to the available space. 



The clamp() function builds on this by allowing us to set a preferred value with a third parameter. Now we can allow the element to shrink or grow if it needs to without getting to a point where it becomes unusable.



.element {
  width: clamp(300px, 50%, 600px);
}







This time, the element’s width will be 50% (the preferred value) of its container but never less than 300px and never more than 600px.



With these techniques, we have a content-first approach to responsive design. We can separate content from markup, meaning the changes users make will not affect the design. We can start to future-proof designs by planning for unexpected changes in language or direction. And we can increase flexibility by setting desired dimensions alongside flexible alternatives, allowing for more or less content to be displayed correctly.



Situation first



Thanks to what we’ve discussed so far, we can cover device flexibility by changing our approach, designing around content and space instead of catering to devices. But what about that last bit of Jeffrey Zeldman’s quote, “...situations you haven’t imagined”?



It’s a very different thing to design for someone seated at a desktop computer as opposed to someone using a mobile phone and moving through a crowded street in glaring sunshine. Situations and environments are hard to plan for or predict because they change as people react to their own unique challenges and tasks.



This is why choice is so important. One size never fits all, so we need to design for multiple scenarios to create equal experiences for all our users.



Thankfully, there is a lot we can do to provide choice.



Responsible design 



“There are parts of the world where mobile data is prohibitively expensive, and where there is little or no broadband infrastructure.”“I Used the Web for a Day on a 50 MB Budget”Chris Ashton



One of the biggest assumptions we make is that people interacting with our designs have a good wifi connection and a wide screen monitor. But in the real world, our users may be commuters traveling on trains or other forms of transport using smaller mobile devices that can experience drops in connectivity. There is nothing more frustrating than a web page that won’t load, but there are ways we can help users use less data or deal with sporadic connectivity.



The srcset attribute allows the browser to decide which image to serve. This means we can create smaller ‘cropped’ images to display on mobile devices in turn using less bandwidth and less data.



&lt;img 
  src=&quot;image-file.jpg&quot;
  srcset=&quot;large.jpg 1024w,
             medium.jpg 640w,
             small.jpg 320w&quot;
     alt=&quot;Image alt text&quot; /&gt;



The preload attribute can also help us to think about how and when media is downloaded. It can be used to tell a browser about any critical assets that need to be downloaded with high priority, improving perceived performance and the user experience. 



&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Standard stylesheet markup--&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; as=&quot;style&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Preload stylesheet markup--&gt;



There’s also native lazy loading, which indicates assets that should only be downloaded when they are needed.



&lt;img src=&quot;image.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;…&quot;&gt;



With srcset, preload, and lazy loading, we can start to tailor a user’s experience based on the situation they find themselves in. What none of this does, however, is allow the user themselves to decide what they want downloaded, as the decision is usually the browser’s to make. 



So how can we put users in control?



The return of media queries 



Media queries have always been about much more than device sizes. They allow content to adapt to different situations, with screen size being just one of them.



We’ve long been able to check for media types like print and speech and features such as hover, resolution, and color. These checks allow us to provide options that suit more than one scenario; it’s less about one-size-fits-all and more about serving adaptable content. 



As of this writing, the Media Queries Level 5 spec is still under development. It introduces some really exciting queries that in the future will help us design for multiple other unexpected situations.



For example, there’s a light-level feature that allows you to modify styles if a user is in sunlight or darkness. Paired with custom properties, these features allow us to quickly create designs or themes for specific environments.



@media (light-level: normal) {
  --background-color: #fff;
  --text-color: #0b0c0c;  
}

@media (light-level: dim) {
  --background-color: #efd226;
  --text-color: #0b0c0c;
}



Another key feature of the Level 5 spec is personalization. Instead of creating designs that are the same for everyone, users can choose what works for them. This is achieved by using features like prefers-reduced-data, prefers-color-scheme, and prefers-reduced-motion, the latter two of which already enjoy broad browser support. These features tap into preferences set via the operating system or browser so people don’t have to spend time making each site they visit more usable. 



Media queries like this go beyond choices made by a browser to grant more control to the user.



Expect the unexpected



In the end, the one thing we should always expect is for things to change. Devices in particular change faster than we can keep up, with foldable screens already on the market.



We can’t design the same way we have for this ever-changing landscape, but we can design for content. By putting content first and allowing that content to adapt to whatever space surrounds it, we can create more robust, flexible designs that increase the longevity of our products. 



A lot of the CSS discussed here is about moving away from layouts and putting content at the heart of design. From responsive components to fixed and fluid units, there is so much more we can do to take a more intrinsic approach. Even better, we can test these techniques during the design phase by designing in-browser and watching how our designs adapt in real-time.



When it comes to unexpected situations, we need to make sure our products are usable when people need them, whenever and wherever that might be. We can move closer to achieving this by involving users in our design decisions, by creating choice via browsers, and by giving control to our users with user-preference-based media queries. 



Good design for the unexpected should allow for change, provide choice, and give control to those we serve: our users themselves.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. 



It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.



Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design work continues iteration after iteration, from a high level to the finest details. Each level needs its own set of questions.



And finally, as with any good research, we need to review what we got back, get to the core of its insights, and take action. Question, iteration, and review. Let’s look at each of those.



The question



Being open to feedback is essential, but we need to be precise about what we’re looking for. Just saying “Any comment?”, “What do you think?”, or “I’d love to get your opinion” at the end of a presentation—whether it’s in person, over video, or through a written post—is likely to get a number of varied opinions or, even worse, get everyone to follow the direction of the first person who speaks up. And then... we get frustrated because vague questions like those can turn a high-level flows review into people instead commenting on the borders of buttons. Which might be a hearty topic, so it might be hard at that point to redirect the team to the subject that you had wanted to focus on.



But how do we get into this situation? It’s a mix of factors. One is that we don’t usually consider asking as a part of the feedback process. Another is how natural it is to just leave the question implied, expecting the others to be on the same page. Another is that in nonprofessional discussions, there’s often no need to be that precise. In short, we tend to underestimate the importance of the questions, so we don’t work on improving them.



The act of asking good questions guides and focuses the critique. It’s also a form of consent: it makes it clear that you’re open to comments and what kind of comments you’d like to get. It puts people in the right mental state, especially in situations when they weren’t expecting to give feedback.



There isn’t a single best way to ask for feedback. It just needs to be specific, and specificity can take many shapes. A model for design critique that I’ve found particularly useful in my coaching is the one of stage versus depth.







“Stage” refers to each of the steps of the process—in our case, the design process. In progressing from user research to the final design, the kind of feedback evolves. But within a single step, one might still review whether some assumptions are correct and whether there’s been a proper translation of the amassed feedback into updated designs as the project has evolved. A starting point for potential questions could derive from the layers of user experience. What do you want to know: Project objectives? User needs? Functionality? Content? Interaction design? Information architecture? UI design? Navigation design? Visual design? Branding?



Here’re a few example questions that are precise and to the point that refer to different layers:



Functionality: Is automating account creation desirable?Interaction design: Take a look through the updated flow and let me know whether you see any steps or error states that I might’ve missed.Information architecture: We have two competing bits of information on this page. Is the structure effective in communicating them both?UI design: What are your thoughts on the error counter at the top of the page that makes sure that you see the next error, even if the error is out of the viewport? Navigation design: From research, we identified these second-level navigation items, but once you’re on the page, the list feels too long and hard to navigate. Are there any suggestions to address this?Visual design: Are the sticky notifications in the bottom-right corner visible enough?



The other axis of specificity is about how deep you’d like to go on what’s being presented. For example, we might have introduced a new end-to-end flow, but there was a specific view that you found particularly challenging and you’d like a detailed review of that. This can be especially useful from one iteration to the next where it’s important to highlight the parts that have changed.



There are other things that we can consider when we want to achieve more specific—and more effective—questions.



A simple trick is to remove generic qualifiers from your questions like “good,” “well,” “nice,” “bad,” “okay,” and “cool.” For example, asking, “When the block opens and the buttons appear, is this interaction good?” might look specific, but you can spot the “good” qualifier, and convert it to an even better question: “When the block opens and the buttons appear, is it clear what the next action is?”



Sometimes we actually do want broad feedback. That’s rare, but it can happen. In that sense, you might still make it explicit that you’re looking for a wide range of opinions, whether at a high level or with details. Or maybe just say, “At first glance, what do you think?” so that it’s clear that what you’re asking is open ended but focused on someone’s impression after their first five seconds of looking at it.



Sometimes the project is particularly expansive, and some areas may have already been explored in detail. In these situations, it might be useful to explicitly say that some parts are already locked in and aren’t open to feedback. It’s not something that I’d recommend in general, but I’ve found it useful to avoid falling again into rabbit holes of the sort that might lead to further refinement but aren’t what’s most important right now.



Asking specific questions can completely change the quality of the feedback that you receive. People with less refined critique skills will now be able to offer more actionable feedback, and even expert designers will welcome the clarity and efficiency that comes from focusing only on what’s needed. It can save a lot of time and frustration.



The iteration



Design iterations are probably the most visible part of the design work, and they provide a natural checkpoint for feedback. Yet a lot of design tools with inline commenting tend to show changes as a single fluid stream in the same file, and those types of design tools make conversations disappear once they’re resolved, update shared UI components automatically, and compel designs to always show the latest version—unless these would-be helpful features were to be manually turned off. The implied goal that these design tools seem to have is to arrive at just one final copy with all discussions closed, probably because they inherited patterns from how written documents are collaboratively edited. That’s probably not the best way to approach design critiques, but even if I don’t want to be too prescriptive here: that could work for some teams.



The asynchronous design-critique approach that I find most effective is to create explicit checkpoints for discussion. I’m going to use the term iteration post for this. It refers to a write-up or presentation of the design iteration followed by a discussion thread of some kind. Any platform that can accommodate this structure can use this. By the way, when I refer to a “write-up or presentation,” I’m including video recordings or other media too: as long as it’s asynchronous, it works.



Using iteration posts has many advantages:



It creates a rhythm in the design work so that the designer can review feedback from each iteration and prepare for the next.It makes decisions visible for future review, and conversations are likewise always available.It creates a record of how the design changed over time.Depending on the tool, it might also make it easier to collect feedback and act on it.



These posts of course don’t mean that no other feedback approach should be used, just that iteration posts could be the primary rhythm for a remote design team to use. And other feedback approaches (such as live critique, pair designing, or inline comments) can build from there.



I don’t think there’s a standard format for iteration posts. But there are a few high-level elements that make sense to include as a baseline:



The goalThe designThe list of changesThe questions



Each project is likely to have a goal, and hopefully it’s something that’s already been summarized in a single sentence somewhere else, such as the client brief, the product manager’s outline, or the project owner’s request. So this is something that I’d repeat in every iteration post—literally copy and pasting it. The idea is to provide context and to repeat what’s essential to make each iteration post complete so that there’s no need to find information spread across multiple posts. If I want to know about the latest design, the latest iteration post will have all that I need.



This copy-and-paste part introduces another relevant concept: alignment comes from repetition. So having posts that repeat information is actually very effective toward making sure that everyone is on the same page.



The design is then the actual series of information-architecture outlines, diagrams, flows, maps, wireframes, screens, visuals, and any other kind of design work that’s been done. In short, it’s any design artifact. For the final stages of work, I prefer the term blueprint to emphasize that I’ll be showing full flows instead of individual screens to make it easier to understand the bigger picture. 



It can also be useful to label the artifacts with clear titles because that can make it easier to refer to them. Write the post in a way that helps people understand the work. It’s not too different from organizing a good live presentation. 



For an efficient discussion, you should also include a bullet list of the changes from the previous iteration to let people focus on what’s new, which can be especially useful for larger pieces of work where keeping track, iteration after iteration, could become a challenge.



And finally, as noted earlier, it’s essential that you include a list of the questions to drive the design critique in the direction you want. Doing this as a numbered list can also help make it easier to refer to each question by its number.



Not all iterations are the same. Earlier iterations don’t need to be as tightly focused—they can be more exploratory and experimental, maybe even breaking some of the design-language guidelines to see what’s possible. Then later, the iterations start settling on a solution and refining it until the design process reaches its end and the feature ships.



I want to highlight that even if these iteration posts are written and conceived as checkpoints, by no means do they need to be exhaustive. A post might be a draft—just a concept to get a conversation going—or it could be a cumulative list of each feature that was added over the course of each iteration until the full picture is done.



Over time, I also started using specific labels for incremental iterations: i1, i2, i3, and so on. This might look like a minor labelling tip, but it can help in multiple ways:



Unique—It’s a clear unique marker. Within each project, one can easily say, “This was discussed in i4,” and everyone knows where they can go to review things.Unassuming—It works like versions (such as v1, v2, and v3) but in contrast, versions create the impression of something that’s big, exhaustive, and complete. Iterations must be able to be exploratory, incomplete, partial.Future proof—It resolves the “final” naming problem that you can run into with versions. No more files named “final final complete no-really-its-done.” Within each project, the largest number always represents the latest iteration.



To mark when a design is complete enough to be worked on, even if there might be some bits still in need of attention and in turn more iterations needed, the wording release candidate (RC) could be used to describe it: “with i8, we reached RC” or “i12 is an RC.”



The review



What usually happens during a design critique is an open discussion, with a back and forth between people that can be very productive. This approach is particularly effective during live, synchronous feedback. But when we work asynchronously, it’s more effective to use a different approach: we can shift to a user-research mindset. Written feedback from teammates, stakeholders, or others can be treated as if it were the result of user interviews and surveys, and we can analyze it accordingly.



This shift has some major benefits that make asynchronous feedback particularly effective, especially around these friction points:



It removes the pressure to reply to everyone.It reduces the frustration from swoop-by comments.It lessens our personal stake.



The first friction point is feeling a pressure to reply to every single comment. Sometimes we write the iteration post, and we get replies from our team. It’s just a few of them, it’s easy, and it doesn’t feel like a problem. But other times, some solutions might require more in-depth discussions, and the amount of replies can quickly increase, which can create a tension between trying to be a good team player by replying to everyone and doing the next design iteration. This might be especially true if the person who’s replying is a stakeholder or someone directly involved in the project who we feel that we need to listen to. We need to accept that this pressure is absolutely normal, and it’s human nature to try to accommodate people who we care about. Sometimes replying to all comments can be effective, but if we treat a design critique more like user research, we realize that we don’t have to reply to every comment, and in asynchronous spaces, there are alternatives:



One is to let the next iteration speak for itself. When the design evolves and we post a follow-up iteration, that’s the reply. You might tag all the people who were involved in the previous discussion, but even that’s a choice, not a requirement. Another is to briefly reply to acknowledge each comment, such as “Understood. Thank you,” “Good points—I’ll review,” or “Thanks. I’ll include these in the next iteration.” In some cases, this could also be just a single top-level comment along the lines of “Thanks for all the feedback everyone—the next iteration is coming soon!”Another is to provide a quick summary of the comments before moving on. Depending on your workflow, this can be particularly useful as it can provide a simplified checklist that you can then use for the next iteration.



The second friction point is the swoop-by comment, which is the kind of feedback that comes from someone outside the project or team who might not be aware of the context, restrictions, decisions, or requirements—or of the previous iterations’ discussions. On their side, there’s something that one can hope that they might learn: they could start to acknowledge that they’re doing this and they could be more conscious in outlining where they’re coming from. Swoop-by comments often trigger the simple thought “We’ve already discussed this…”, and it can be frustrating to have to repeat the same reply over and over.



Let’s begin by acknowledging again that there’s no need to reply to every comment. If, however, replying to a previously litigated point might be useful, a short reply with a link to the previous discussion for extra details is usually enough. Remember, alignment comes from repetition, so it’s okay to repeat things sometimes!



Swoop-by commenting can still be useful for two reasons: they might point out something that still isn’t clear, and they also have the potential to stand in for the point of view of a user who’s seeing the design for the first time. Sure, you’ll still be frustrated, but that might at least help in dealing with it.



The third friction point is the personal stake we could have with the design, which could make us feel defensive if the review were to feel more like a discussion. Treating feedback as user research helps us create a healthy distance between the people giving us feedback and our ego (because yes, even if we don’t want to admit it, it’s there). And ultimately, treating everything in aggregated form allows us to better prioritize our work.



Always remember that while you need to listen to stakeholders, project owners, and specific advice, you don’t have to accept every piece of feedback. You have to analyze it and make a decision that you can justify, but sometimes “no” is the right answer. 



As the designer leading the project, you’re in charge of that decision. Ultimately, everyone has their specialty, and as the designer, you’re the one who has the most knowledge and the most context to make the right decision. And by listening to the feedback that you’ve received, you’re making sure that it’s also the best and most balanced decision.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Feedback, in whichever form it takes, and whatever it may be called, is one of the most effective soft skills that we have at our disposal to collaboratively get our designs to a better place while growing our own skills and perspectives.



Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved. Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term. Quality feedback can be a transformative force. 



Practicing our skills is surely a good way to improve, but the learning gets even faster when it’s paired with a good foundation that channels and focuses the practice. What are some foundational aspects of giving good feedback? And how can feedback be adjusted for remote and distributed work environments? 



On the web, we can identify a long tradition of asynchronous feedback: from the early days of open source, code was shared and discussed on mailing lists. Today, developers engage on pull requests, designers comment in their favorite design tools, project managers and scrum masters exchange ideas on tickets, and so on.



Design critique is often the name used for a type of feedback that’s provided to make our work better, collaboratively. So it shares a lot of the principles with feedback in general, but it also has some differences.



The content



The foundation of every good critique is the feedback’s content, so that’s where we need to start. There are many models that you can use to shape your content. The one that I personally like best—because it’s clear and actionable—is this one from Lara Hogan.







While this equation is generally used to give feedback to people, it also fits really well in a design critique because it ultimately answers some of the core questions that we work on: What? Where? Why? How? Imagine that you’re giving some feedback about some design work that spans multiple screens, like an onboarding flow: there are some pages shown, a flow blueprint, and an outline of the decisions made. You spot something that could be improved. If you keep the three elements of the equation in mind, you’ll have a mental model that can help you be more precise and effective.



Here is a comment that could be given as a part of some feedback, and it might look reasonable at a first glance: it seems to superficially fulfill the elements in the equation. But does it?



Not sure about the buttons’ styles and hierarchy—it feels off. Can you change them?



Observation for design feedback doesn’t just mean pointing out which part of the interface your feedback refers to, but it also refers to offering a perspective that’s as specific as possible. Are you providing the user’s perspective? Your expert perspective? A business perspective? The project manager’s perspective? A first-time user’s perspective?



When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back.



Impact is about the why. Just pointing out a UI element might sometimes be enough if the issue may be obvious, but more often than not, you should add an explanation of what you’re pointing out.



When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow.



The question approach is meant to provide open guidance by eliciting the critical thinking in the designer receiving the feedback. Notably, in Lara’s equation she provides a second approach: request, which instead provides guidance toward a specific solution. While that’s a viable option for feedback in general, for design critiques, in my experience, defaulting to the question approach usually reaches the best solutions because designers are generally more comfortable in being given an open space to explore.



The difference between the two can be exemplified with, for the question approach:



When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Would it make sense to unify them?



Or, for the request approach:



When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Let’s make sure that all screens have the same pair of forward and back buttons.



At this point in some situations, it might be useful to integrate with an extra why: why you consider the given suggestion to be better.



When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Let’s make sure that all screens have the same two forward and back buttons so that users don’t get confused.



Choosing the question approach or the request approach can also at times be a matter of personal preference. A while ago, I was putting a lot of effort into improving my feedback: I did rounds of anonymous feedback, and I reviewed feedback with other people. After a few rounds of this work and a year later, I got a positive response: my feedback came across as effective and grounded. Until I changed teams. To my shock, my next round of feedback from one specific person wasn’t that great. The reason is that I had previously tried not to be prescriptive in my advice—because the people who I was previously working with preferred the open-ended question format over the request style of suggestions. But now in this other team, there was one person who instead preferred specific guidance. So I adapted my feedback for them to include requests.



One comment that I heard come up a few times is that this kind of feedback is quite long, and it doesn’t seem very efficient. No… but also yes. Let’s explore both sides.



No, this style of feedback is actually efficient because the length here is a byproduct of clarity, and spending time giving this kind of feedback can provide exactly enough information for a good fix. Also if we zoom out, it can reduce future back-and-forth conversations and misunderstandings, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of collaboration beyond the single comment. Imagine that in the example above the feedback were instead just, “Let’s make sure that all screens have the same two forward and back buttons.” The designer receiving this feedback wouldn’t have much to go by, so they might just apply the change. In later iterations, the interface might change or they might introduce new features—and maybe that change might not make sense anymore. Without the why, the designer might imagine that the change is about consistency… but what if it wasn’t? So there could now be an underlying concern that changing the buttons would be perceived as a regression.



Yes, this style of feedback is not always efficient because the points in some comments don’t always need to be exhaustive, sometimes because certain changes may be obvious (“The font used doesn’t follow our guidelines”) and sometimes because the team may have a lot of internal knowledge such that some of the whys may be implied.



So the equation above isn’t meant to suggest a strict template for feedback but a mnemonic to reflect and improve the practice. Even after years of active work on my critiques, I still from time to time go back to this formula and reflect on whether what I just wrote is effective.



The tone



Well-grounded content is the foundation of feedback, but that’s not really enough. The soft skills of the person who’s providing the critique can multiply the likelihood that the feedback will be well received and understood. Tone alone can make the difference between content that’s rejected or welcomed, and it’s been demonstrated that only positive feedback creates sustained change in people.



Since our goal is to be understood and to have a positive working environment, tone is essential to work on. Over the years, I’ve tried to summarize the required soft skills in a formula that mirrors the one for content: the receptivity equation.







Respectful feedback comes across as grounded, solid, and constructive. It’s the kind of feedback that, whether it’s positive or negative, is perceived as useful and fair.



Timing refers to when the feedback happens. To-the-point feedback doesn’t have much hope of being well received if it’s given at the wrong time. Questioning the entire high-level information architecture of a new feature when it’s about to ship might still be relevant if that questioning highlights a major blocker that nobody saw, but it’s way more likely that those concerns will have to wait for a later rework. So in general, attune your feedback to the stage of the project. Early iteration? Late iteration? Polishing work in progress? These all have different needs. The right timing will make it more likely that your feedback will be well received.



Attitude is the equivalent of intent, and in the context of person-to-person feedback, it can be referred to as radical candor. That means checking before we write to see whether what we have in mind will truly help the person and make the project better overall. This might be a hard reflection at times because maybe we don’t want to admit that we don’t really appreciate that person. Hopefully that’s not the case, but that can happen, and that’s okay. Acknowledging and owning that can help you make up for that: how would I write if I really cared about them? How can I avoid being passive aggressive? How can I be more constructive?



Form is relevant especially in a diverse and cross-cultural work environments because having great content, perfect timing, and the right attitude might not come across if the way that we write creates misunderstandings. There might be many reasons for this: sometimes certain words might trigger specific reactions; sometimes nonnative speakers might not understand all the nuances of some sentences; sometimes our brains might just be different and we might perceive the world differently—neurodiversity must be taken into consideration. Whatever the reason, it’s important to review not just what we write but how.



A few years back, I was asking for some feedback on how I give feedback. I received some good advice but also a comment that surprised me. They pointed out that when I wrote “Oh, […],” I made them feel stupid. That wasn’t my intent! I felt really bad, and I just realized that I provided feedback to them for months, and every time I might have made them feel stupid. I was horrified… but also thankful. I made a quick fix: I added “oh” in my list of replaced words (your choice between: macOS’s text replacement, aText, TextExpander, or others) so that when I typed “oh,” it was instantly deleted. 



Something to highlight because it’s quite frequent—especially in teams that have a strong group spirit—is that people tend to beat around the bush. It’s important to remember here that a positive attitude doesn’t mean going light on the feedback—it just means that even when you provide hard, difficult, or challenging feedback, you do so in a way that’s respectful and constructive. The nicest thing that you can do for someone is to help them grow.



We have a great advantage in giving feedback in written form: it can be reviewed by another person who isn’t directly involved, which can help to reduce or remove any bias that might be there. I found that the best, most insightful moments for me have happened when I’ve shared a comment and I’ve asked someone who I highly trusted, “How does this sound?,” “How can I do it better,” and even “How would you have written it?”—and I’ve learned a lot by seeing the two versions side by side.



The format



Asynchronous feedback also has a major inherent advantage: we can take more time to refine what we’ve written to make sure that it fulfills two main goals: the clarity of communication and the actionability of the suggestions.







Let’s imagine that someone shared a design iteration for a project. You are reviewing it and leaving a comment. There are many ways to do this, and of course context matters, but let’s try to think about some elements that may be useful to consider.



In terms of clarity, start by grounding the critique that you’re about to give by providing context. Specifically, this means describing where you’re coming from: do you have a deep knowledge of the project, or is this the first time that you’re seeing it? Are you coming from a high-level perspective, or are you figuring out the details? Are there regressions? Which user’s perspective are you taking when providing your feedback? Is the design iteration at a point where it would be okay to ship this, or are there major things that need to be addressed first?



Providing context is helpful even if you’re sharing feedback within a team that already has some information on the project. And context is absolutely essential when giving cross-team feedback. If I were to review a design that might be indirectly related to my work, and if I had no knowledge about how the project arrived at that point, I would say so, highlighting my take as external.



We often focus on the negatives, trying to outline all the things that could be done better. That’s of course important, but it’s just as important—if not more—to focus on the positives, especially if you saw progress from the previous iteration. This might seem superfluous, but it’s important to keep in mind that design is a discipline where there are hundreds of possible solutions for every problem. So pointing out that the design solution that was chosen is good and explaining why it’s good has two major benefits: it confirms that the approach taken was solid, and it helps to ground your negative feedback. In the longer term, sharing positive feedback can help prevent regressions on things that are going well because those things will have been highlighted as important. As a bonus, positive feedback can also help reduce impostor syndrome.



There’s one powerful approach that combines both context and a focus on the positives: frame how the design is better than the status quo (compared to a previous iteration, competitors, or benchmarks) and why, and then on that foundation, you can add what could be improved. This is powerful because there’s a big difference between a critique that’s for a design that’s already in good shape and a critique that’s for a design that isn’t quite there yet.



Another way that you can improve your feedback is to depersonalize the feedback: the comments should always be about the work, never about the person who made it. It’s “This button isn’t well aligned” versus “You haven’t aligned this button well.” This is very easy to change in your writing by reviewing it just before sending.



In terms of actionability, one of the best approaches to help the designer who’s reading through your feedback is to split it into bullet points or paragraphs, which are easier to review and analyze one by one. For longer pieces of feedback, you might also consider splitting it into sections or even across multiple comments. Of course, adding screenshots or signifying markers of the specific part of the interface you’re referring to can also be especially useful.



One approach that I’ve personally used effectively in some contexts is to enhance the bullet points with four markers using emojis. So a red square 🟥 means that it’s something that I consider blocking; a yellow diamond 🔶 is something that I can be convinced otherwise, but it seems to me that it should be changed; and a green circle 🟢 is a detailed, positive confirmation. I also use a blue spiral 🌀 for either something that I’m not sure about, an exploration, an open alternative, or just a note. But I’d use this approach only on teams where I’ve already established a good level of trust because if it happens that I have to deliver a lot of red squares, the impact could be quite demoralizing, and I’d reframe how I’d communicate that a bit.



Let’s see how this would work by reusing the example that we used earlier as the first bullet point in this list:



🔶 Navigation—When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Let’s make sure that all screens have the same two forward and back buttons so that users don’t get confused.🟢 Overall—I think the page is solid, and this is good enough to be our release candidate for a version 1.0.🟢 Metrics—Good improvement in the buttons on the metrics area; the improved contrast and new focus style make them more accessible. 🟥  Button Style—Using the green accent in this context creates the impression that it’s a positive action because green is usually perceived as a confirmation color. Do we need to explore a different color?🔶Tiles—Given the number of items on the page, and the overall page hierarchy, it seems to me that the tiles shouldn’t be using the Subtitle 1 style but the Subtitle 2 style. This will keep the visual hierarchy more consistent.🌀 Background—Using a light texture works well, but I wonder whether it adds too much noise in this kind of page. What is the thinking in using that?



What about giving feedback directly in Figma or another design tool that allows in-place feedback? In general, I find these difficult to use because they hide discussions and they’re harder to track, but in the right context, they can be very effective. Just make sure that each of the comments is separate so that it’s easier to match each discussion to a single task, similar to the idea of splitting mentioned above.



One final note: say the obvious. Sometimes we might feel that something is obviously good or obviously wrong, and so we don’t say it. Or sometimes we might have a doubt that we don’t express because the question might sound stupid. Say it—that’s okay. You might have to reword it a little bit to make the reader feel more comfortable, but don’t hold it back. Good feedback is transparent, even when it may be obvious.



There’s another advantage of asynchronous feedback: written feedback automatically tracks decisions. Especially in large projects, “Why did we do this?” could be a question that pops up from time to time, and there’s nothing better than open, transparent discussions that can be reviewed at any time. For this reason, I recommend using software that saves these discussions, without hiding them once they are resolved. 



Content, tone, and format. Each one of these subjects provides a useful model, but working to improve eight areas—observation, impact, question, timing, attitude, form, clarity, and actionability—is a lot of work to put in all at once. One effective approach is to take them one by one: first identify the area that you lack the most (either from your perspective or from feedback from others) and start there. Then the second, then the third, and so on. At first you’ll have to put in extra time for every piece of feedback that you give, but after a while, it’ll become second nature, and your impact on the work will multiply.

Beautiful, peaceful souls get quieter and fade into that distant and distracted burnout we’ve all read about. But some of us, those with fires always burning on the edges of our core, get hotter. In my heart I am fire. When I face burnout I double down, triple down, burning hotter and hotter to try to best the challenge. I don’t fade—I am engulfed in a zealous burnout. 



So what on earth is a zealous burnout?



Imagine a woman determined to do it all. She has two amazing children whom she, along with her husband who is also working remotely, is homeschooling during a pandemic. She has a demanding client load at work—all of whom she loves. She gets up early to get some movement in (or often catch up on work), does dinner prep as the kids are eating breakfast, and gets to work while positioning herself near “fourth grade” to listen in as she juggles clients, tasks, and budgets. Sound like a lot? Even with a supportive team both at home and at work, it is. 



Sounds like this woman has too much on her plate and needs self-care. But no, she doesn’t have time for that. In fact, she starts to feel like she’s dropping balls. Not accomplishing enough. There’s not enough of her to be here and there; she is trying to divide her mind in two all the time, all day, every day. She starts to doubt herself. And as those feelings creep in more and more, her internal narrative becomes more and more critical.



Suddenly she KNOWS what she needs to do! She should DO MORE. 



This is a hard and dangerous cycle. Know why? Because once she doesn’t finish that new goal, that narrative will get worse. Suddenly she’s failing. She isn’t doing enough. SHE is not enough. She might fail, she might fail her family...so she’ll find more she should do. She doesn’t sleep as much, move as much, all in the efforts to do more. Caught in this cycle of trying to prove herself to herself, never reaching any goal. Never feeling “enough.” 



So, yeah, that’s what zealous burnout looks like for me. It doesn’t happen overnight in some grand gesture but instead slowly builds over weeks and months. My burning out process looks like speeding up, not a person losing focus. I speed up and up and up...and then I just stop.



I am the one who could



It’s funny the things that shape us. Through the lens of childhood, I viewed the fears, struggles, and sacrifices of someone who had to make it all work without having enough. I was lucky that my mother was so resourceful and my father supportive; I never went without and even got an extra here or there. 



Growing up, I did not feel shame when my mother paid with food stamps; in fact, I’d have likely taken on any debate on the topic, verbally eviscerating anyone who dared to criticize the disabled woman trying to make sure all our needs were met with so little. As a child, I watched the way the fear of not making those ends meet impacted people I love. As the non-disabled person in my home, I would take on many of the physical tasks because I was “the one who could” make our lives a little easier. I learned early to associate fears or uncertainty with putting more of myself into it—I am the one who can. I learned early that when something frightens me, I can double down and work harder to make it better. I can own the challenge. When people have seen this in me as an adult, I’ve been told I seem fearless, but make no mistake, I’m not. If I seem fearless, it’s because this behavior was forged from other people’s fears. 



And here I am, more than 30 years later still feeling the urge to mindlessly push myself forward when faced with overwhelming tasks ahead of me, assuming that I am the one who can and therefore should. I find myself driven to prove that I can make things happen if I work longer hours, take on more responsibility, and do more. 



I do not see people who struggle financially as failures, because I have seen how strong that tide can be—it pulls you along the way. I truly get that I have been privileged to be able to avoid many of the challenges that were present in my youth. That said, I am still “the one who can” who feels she should, so if I were faced with not having enough to make ends meet for my own family, I would see myself as having failed. Though I am supported and educated, most of this is due to good fortune. I will, however, allow myself the arrogance of saying I have been careful with my choices to have encouraged that luck. My identity stems from the idea that I am “the one who can” so therefore feel obligated to do the most. I can choose to stop, and with some quite literal cold water splashed in my face, I’ve made the choice to before. But that choosing to stop is not my go-to; I move forward, driven by a fear that is so a part of me that I barely notice it’s there until I’m feeling utterly worn away.



So why all the history? You see, burnout is a fickle thing. I have heard and read a lot about burnout over the years. Burnout is real. Especially now, with COVID, many of us are balancing more than we ever have before—all at once! It’s hard, and the procrastinating, the avoidance, the shutting down impacts so many amazing professionals. There are important articles that relate to what I imagine must be the majority of people out there, but not me. That’s not what my burnout looks like.



The dangerous invisibility of zealous burnout



A lot of work environments see the extra hours, extra effort, and overall focused commitment as an asset (and sometimes that’s all it is). They see someone trying to rise to challenges, not someone stuck in their fear. Many well-meaning organizations have safeguards in place to protect their teams from burnout. But in cases like this, those alarms are not always tripped, and then when the inevitable stop comes, some members of the organization feel surprised and disappointed. And sometimes maybe even betrayed. 



Parents—more so mothers, statistically speaking—are praised as being so on top of it all when they can work, be involved in the after-school activities, practice self-care in the form of diet and exercise, and still meet friends for coffee or wine. During COVID many of us have binged countless streaming episodes showing how it’s so hard for the female protagonist, but she is strong and funny and can do it. It’s a “very special episode” when she breaks down, cries in the bathroom, woefully admits she needs help, and just stops for a bit. Truth is, countless people are hiding their tears or are doom-scrolling to escape. We know that the media is a lie to amuse us, but often the perception that it’s what we should strive for has penetrated much of society.



Women and burnout



I love men. And though I don’t love every man (heads up, I don’t love every woman or nonbinary person either), I think there is a beautiful spectrum of individuals who represent that particular binary gender. 



That said, women are still more often at risk of burnout than their male counterparts, especially in these COVID stressed times. Mothers in the workplace feel the pressure to do all the “mom” things while giving 110%. Mothers not in the workplace feel they need to do more to “justify” their lack of traditional employment. Women who are not mothers often feel the need to do even more because they don’t have that extra pressure at home. It’s vicious and systemic and so a part of our culture that we’re often not even aware of the enormity of the pressures we put on ourselves and each other. 



And there are prices beyond happiness too. Harvard Health Publishing released a study a decade ago that “uncovered strong links between women’s job stress and cardiovascular disease.” The CDC noted, “Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, killing 299,578 women in 2017—or about 1 in every 5 female deaths.” 



This relationship between work stress and health, from what I have read, is more dangerous for women than it is for their non-female counterparts.



But what if your burnout isn’t like that either?



That might not be you either. After all, each of us is so different and how we respond to stressors is too. It’s part of what makes us human. Don’t stress what burnout looks like, just learn to recognize it in yourself. Here are a few questions I sometimes ask friends if I am concerned about them.



Are you happy? This simple question should be the first thing you ask yourself. Chances are, even if you’re burning out doing all the things you love, as you approach burnout you’ll just stop taking as much joy from it all.



Do you feel empowered to say no? I have observed in myself and others that when someone is burning out, they no longer feel they can say no to things. Even those who don’t “speed up” feel pressure to say yes to not disappoint the people around them.



What are three things you’ve done for yourself? Another observance is that we all tend to stop doing things for ourselves. Anything from skipping showers and eating poorly to avoiding talking to friends. These can be red flags. 



Are you making excuses? Many of us try to disregard feelings of burnout. Over and over I have heard, “It’s just crunch time,” “As soon as I do this one thing, it will all be better,” and “Well I should be able to handle this, so I’ll figure it out.” And it might really be crunch time, a single goal, and/or a skill set you need to learn. That happens—life happens. BUT if this doesn’t stop, be honest with yourself. If you’ve worked more 50-hour weeks since January than not, maybe it’s not crunch time—maybe it’s a bad situation that you’re burning out from.



Do you have a plan to stop feeling this way? If something is truly temporary and you do need to just push through, then it has an exit route with adefined end.



Take the time to listen to yourself as you would a friend. Be honest, allow yourself to be uncomfortable, and break the thought cycles that prevent you from healing. 



So now what?



What I just described is a different path to burnout, but it’s still burnout. There are well-established approaches to working through burnout:



Get enough sleep.Eat healthy.Work out.Get outside.Take a break.Overall, practice self-care.



Those are hard for me because they feel like more tasks. If I’m in the burnout cycle, doing any of the above for me feels like a waste. The narrative is that if I’m already failing, why would I take care of myself when I’m dropping all those other balls? People need me, right? 



If you’re deep in the cycle, your inner voice might be pretty awful by now. If you need to, tell yourself you need to take care of the person your people depend on. If your roles are pushing you toward burnout, use them to help make healing easier by justifying the time spent working on you. 



To help remind myself of the airline attendant message about putting the mask on yourself first, I have come up with a few things that I do when I start feeling myself going into a zealous burnout.



Cook an elaborate meal for someone! 



OK, I am a “food-focused” individual so cooking for someone is always my go-to. There are countless tales in my home of someone walking into the kitchen and turning right around and walking out when they noticed I was “chopping angrily.” But it’s more than that, and you should give it a try. Seriously. It’s the perfect go-to if you don’t feel worthy of taking time for yourself—do it for someone else. Most of us work in a digital world, so cooking can fill all of your senses and force you to be in the moment with all the ways you perceive the world. It can break you out of your head and help you gain a better perspective. In my house, I’ve been known to pick a place on the map and cook food that comes from wherever that is (thank you, Pinterest). I love cooking Indian food, as the smells are warm, the bread needs just enough kneading to keep my hands busy, and the process takes real attention for me because it’s not what I was brought up making. And in the end, we all win!



Vent like a foul-mouthed fool



Be careful with this one! 



I have been making an effort to practice more gratitude over the past few years, and I recognize the true benefits of that. That said, sometimes you just gotta let it all out—even the ugly. Hell, I’m a big fan of not sugarcoating our lives, and that sometimes means that to get past the big pile of poop, you’re gonna wanna complain about it a bit. 



When that is what’s needed, turn to a trusted friend and allow yourself some pure verbal diarrhea, saying all the things that are bothering you. You need to trust this friend not to judge, to see your pain, and, most importantly, to tell you to remove your cranium from your own rectal cavity. Seriously, it’s about getting a reality check here! One of the things I admire the most about my husband (though often after the fact) is his ability to break things down to their simplest. “We’re spending our lives together, of course you’re going to disappoint me from time to time, so get over it” has been his way of speaking his dedication, love, and acceptance of me—and I could not be more grateful. It also, of course, has meant that I needed to remove my head from that rectal cavity. So, again, usually those moments are appreciated in hindsight.



Pick up a book! 



There are many books out there that aren’t so much self-help as they are people just like you sharing their stories and how they’ve come to find greater balance. Maybe you’ll find something that speaks to you. Titles that have stood out to me include:



Thrive by Arianna HuffingtonTools of Titans by Tim FerrissGirl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel HollisDare to Lead by Brené Brown



Or, another tactic I love to employ is to read or listen to a book that has NOTHING to do with my work-life balance. I’ve read the following books and found they helped balance me out because my mind was pondering their interesting topics instead of running in circles:



The Drunken Botanist by Amy StewartSuperlife by Darin OlienA Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived by Adam RutherfordGaia’s Garden by Toby Hemenway 



If you’re not into reading, pick up a topic on YouTube or choose a podcast to subscribe to. I’ve watched countless permaculture and gardening topics in addition to how to raise chickens and ducks. For the record, I do not have a particularly large food garden, nor do I own livestock of any kind...yet. I just find the topic interesting, and it has nothing to do with any aspect of my life that needs anything from me.



Forgive yourself 



You are never going to be perfect—hell, it would be boring if you were. It’s OK to be broken and flawed. It’s human to be tired and sad and worried. It’s OK to not do it all. It’s scary to be imperfect, but you cannot be brave if nothing were scary.



This last one is the most important: allow yourself permission to NOT do it all. You never promised to be everything to everyone at all times. We are more powerful than the fears that drive us. 



This is hard. It is hard for me. It’s what’s driven me to write this—that it’s OK to stop. It’s OK that your unhealthy habit that might even benefit those around you needs to end. You can still be successful in life.



I recently read that we are all writing our eulogy in how we live. Knowing that your professional accomplishments won’t be mentioned in that speech, what will yours say? What do you want it to say? 



Look, I get that none of these ideas will “fix it,” and that’s not their purpose. None of us are in control of our surroundings, only how we respond to them. These suggestions are to help stop the spiral effect so that you are empowered to address the underlying issues and choose your response. They are things that work for me most of the time. Maybe they’ll work for you.



Does this sound familiar? 



If this sounds familiar, it’s not just you. Don’t let your negative self-talk tell you that you “even burn out wrong.” It’s not wrong. Even if rooted in fear like my own drivers, I believe that this need to do more comes from a place of love, determination, motivation, and other wonderful attributes that make you the amazing person you are. We’re going to be OK, ya know. The lives that unfold before us might never look like that story in our head—that idea of “perfect” or “done” we’re looking for, but that’s OK. Really, when we stop and look around, usually the only eyes that judge us are in the mirror. 



Do you remember that Winnie the Pooh sketch that had Pooh eat so much at Rabbit’s house that his buttocks couldn’t fit through the door? Well, I already associate a lot with Rabbit, so it came as no surprise when he abruptly declared that this was unacceptable. But do you recall what happened next? He put a shelf across poor Pooh’s ankles and decorations on his back, and made the best of the big butt in his kitchen. 



At the end of the day we are resourceful and know that we are able to push ourselves if we need to—even when we are tired to our core or have a big butt of fluff ‘n’ stuff in our room. None of us has to be afraid, as we can manage any obstacle put in front of us. And maybe that means we will need to redefine success to allow space for being uncomfortably human, but that doesn’t really sound so bad either. 



So, wherever you are right now, please breathe. Do what you need to do to get out of your head. Forgive and take care.

    <p class="article__summary">This Person Does Not Exist is a website that generates human faces with a machine learning algorithm. It takes real portraits and recombines them into fake human faces. We recently scrolled past a LinkedIn post stating that this website could be useful “if you are developing a persona and looking for a photo.” 



We agree: the computer-generated faces could be a great match for personas—but not for the reason you might think. Ironically, the website highlights the core issue of this very common design method: the person(a) does not exist. Like the pictures, personas are artificially made. Information is taken out of natural context and recombined into an isolated snapshot that’s detached from reality. 



But strangely enough, designers use personas to inspire their design for the real world. 



Personas: A step back



Most designers have created, used, or come across personas at least once in their career. In their article “Personas - A Simple Introduction,” the Interaction Design Foundation defines personas as “fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand.” In their most complete expression, personas typically consist of a name, profile picture, quotes, demographics, goals, needs, behavior in relation to a certain service/product, emotions, and motivations (for example, see Creative Companion’s Persona Core Poster). The purpose of personas, as stated by design agency Designit, is “to make the research relatable, [and] easy to communicate, digest, reference, and apply to product and service development.”



The decontextualization of personas



Personas are popular because they make “dry” research data more relatable, more human. However, this method constrains the researcher’s data analysis in such a way that the investigated users are removed from their unique contexts. As a result, personas don’t portray key factors that make you understand their decision-making process or allow you to relate to users’ thoughts and behavior; they lack stories. You understand what the persona did, but you don’t have the background to understand why. You end up with representations of users that are actually less human.



This “decontextualization” we see in personas happens in four ways, which we’ll explain below. 



Personas assume people are static 



Although many companies still try to box in their employees and customers with outdated personality tests (referring to you, Myers-Briggs), here’s a painfully obvious truth: people are not a fixed set of features. You act, think, and feel differently according to the situations you experience. You appear different to different people; you might act friendly to some, rough to others. And you change your mind all the time about decisions you’ve taken. 



Modern psychologists agree that while people generally behave according to certain patterns, it’s actually a combination of background and environment that determines how people act and take decisions. The context—the environment, the influence of other people, your mood, the entire history that led up to a situation—determines the kind of person you are in each specific moment. 



In their attempt to simplify reality, personas do not take this variability into account; they present a user as a fixed set of features. Like personality tests, personas snatch people away from real life. Even worse, people are reduced to a label and categorized as “that kind of person” with no means to exercise their innate flexibility. This practice reinforces stereotypes, lowers diversity, and doesn’t reflect reality. 



Personas focus on individuals, not the environment



In the real world, you’re designing for a context, not for an individual. Each person lives in a family, a community, an ecosystem, where there are environmental, political, and social factors you need to consider. A design is never meant for a single user. Rather, you design for one or more particular contexts in which many people might use that product. Personas, however, show the user alone rather than describe how the user relates to the environment. 



Would you always make the same decision over and over again? Maybe you’re a committed vegan but still decide to buy some meat when your relatives are coming over. As they depend on different situations and variables, your decisions—and behavior, opinions, and statements—are not absolute but highly contextual. The persona that “represents” you wouldn’t take into account this dependency, because it doesn’t specify the premises of your decisions. It doesn’t provide a justification of why you act the way you do. Personas enact the well-known bias called fundamental attribution error: explaining others’ behavior too much by their personality and too little by the situation.



As mentioned by the Interaction Design Foundation, personas are usually placed in a scenario that’s a “specific context with a problem they want to or have to solve”—does that mean context actually is considered? Unfortunately, what often happens is that you take a fictional character and based on that fiction determine how this character might deal with a certain situation. This is made worse by the fact that you haven’t even fully investigated and understood the current context of the people your persona seeks to represent; so how could you possibly understand how they would act in new situations? 



Personas are meaningless averages



As mentioned in Shlomo Goltz’s introductory article on Smashing Magazine, “a persona is depicted as a specific person but is not a real individual; rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people.” A well-known critique to this aspect of personas is that the average person does not exist, as per the famous example of the USA Air Force designing planes based on the average of 140 of their pilots’ physical dimensions and not a single pilot actually fitting within that average seat. 



The same limitation applies to mental aspects of people. Have you ever heard a famous person say, “They took what I said out of context! They used my words, but I didn’t mean it like that.” The celebrity’s statement was reported literally, but the reporter failed to explain the context around the statement and didn’t describe the non-verbal expressions. As a result, the intended meaning was lost. You do the same when you create personas: you collect somebody’s statement (or goal, or need, or emotion), of which the meaning can only be understood if you provide its own specific context, yet report it as an isolated finding. 



But personas go a step further, extracting a decontextualized finding and joining it with another decontextualized finding from somebody else. The resulting set of findings often does not make sense: it’s unclear, or even contrasting, because it lacks the underlying reasons on why and how that finding has arisen. It lacks meaning. And the persona doesn’t give you the full background of the person(s) to uncover this meaning: you would need to dive into the raw data for each single persona item to find it. What, then, is the usefulness of the persona?







The relatability of personas is deceiving



To a certain extent, designers realize that a persona is a lifeless average. To overcome this, designers invent and add “relatable” details to personas to make them resemble real individuals. Nothing captures the absurdity of this better than a sentence by the Interaction Design Foundation: “Add a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character.” In other words, you add non-realism in an attempt to create more realism. You deliberately obscure the fact that “John Doe” is an abstract representation of research findings; but wouldn’t it be much more responsible to emphasize that John is only an abstraction? If something is artificial, let’s present it as such.



It’s the finishing touch of a persona’s decontextualization: after having assumed that people’s personalities are fixed, dismissed the importance of their environment, and hidden meaning by joining isolated, non-generalizable findings, designers invent new context to create (their own) meaning. In doing so, as with everything they create, they introduce a host of biases. As phrased by Designit, as designers we can “contextualize [the persona] based on our reality and experience. We create connections that are familiar to us.” This practice reinforces stereotypes, doesn’t reflect real-world diversity, and gets further away from people’s actual reality with every detail added. 



To do good design research, we should report the reality “as-is” and make it relatable for our audience, so everyone can use their own empathy and develop their own interpretation and emotional response.



Dynamic Selves: The alternative to personas



If we shouldn’t use personas, what should we do instead? 



Designit has proposed using Mindsets instead of personas. Each Mindset is a “spectrum of attitudes and emotional responses that different people have within the same context or life experience.” It challenges designers to not get fixated on a single user’s way of being. Unfortunately, while being a step in the right direction, this proposal doesn’t take into account that people are part of an environment that determines their personality, their behavior, and, yes, their mindset. Therefore, Mindsets are also not absolute but change in regard to the situation. The question remains, what determines a certain Mindset?



Another alternative comes from Margaret P., author of the article “Kill Your Personas,” who has argued for replacing personas with persona spectrums that consist of a range of user abilities. For example, a visual impairment could be permanent (blindness), temporary (recovery from eye surgery), or situational (screen glare). Persona spectrums are highly useful for more inclusive and context-based design, as they’re based on the understanding that the context is the pattern, not the personality. Their limitation, however, is that they have a very functional take on users that misses the relatability of a real person taken from within a spectrum. 



In developing an alternative to personas, we aim to transform the standard design process to be context-based. Contexts are generalizable and have patterns that we can identify, just like we tried to do previously with people. So how do we identify these patterns? How do we ensure truly context-based design? 



Understand real individuals in multiple contexts



Nothing is more relatable and inspiring than reality. Therefore, we have to understand real individuals in their multi-faceted contexts, and use this understanding to fuel our design. We refer to this approach as Dynamic Selves.



Let’s take a look at what the approach looks like, based on an example of how one of us applied it in a recent project that researched habits of Italians around energy consumption. We drafted a design research plan aimed at investigating people’s attitudes toward energy consumption and sustainable behavior, with a focus on smart thermostats. 



1. Choose the right sample



When we argue against personas, we’re often challenged with quotes such as “Where are you going to find a single person that encapsulates all the information from one of these advanced personas[?]” The answer is simple: you don’t have to. You don’t need to have information about many people for your insights to be deep and meaningful. 



In qualitative research, validity does not derive from quantity but from accurate sampling. You select the people that best represent the “population” you’re designing for. If this sample is chosen well, and you have understood the sampled people in sufficient depth, you’re able to infer how the rest of the population thinks and behaves. There’s no need to study seven Susans and five Yuriys; one of each will do. 



Similarly, you don’t need to understand Susan in fifteen different contexts. Once you’ve seen her in a couple of diverse situations, you’ve understood the scheme of Susan’s response to different contexts. Not Susan as an atomic being but Susan in relation to the surrounding environment: how she might act, feel, and think in different situations. 



Given that each person is representative of a part of the total population you’re researching, it becomes clear why each should be represented as an individual, as each already is an abstraction of a larger group of individuals in similar contexts. You don’t want abstractions of abstractions! These selected people need to be understood and shown in their full expression, remaining in their microcosmos—and if you want to identify patterns you can focus on identifying patterns in contexts.



Yet the question remains: how do you select a representative sample? First of all, you have to consider what’s the target audience of the product or service you are designing: it might be useful to look at the company’s goals and strategy, the current customer base, and/or a possible future target audience. 



In our example project, we were designing an application for those who own a smart thermostat. In the future, everyone could have a smart thermostat in their house. Right now, though, only early adopters own one. To build a significant sample, we needed to understand the reason why these early adopters became such. We therefore recruited by asking people why they had a smart thermostat and how they got it. There were those who had chosen to buy it, those who had been influenced by others to buy it, and those who had found it in their house. So we selected representatives of these three situations, from different age groups and geographical locations, with an equal balance of tech savvy and non-tech savvy participants. 



2. Conduct your research



After having chosen and recruited your sample, conduct your research using ethnographic methodologies. This will make your qualitative data rich with anecdotes and examples. In our example project, given COVID-19 restrictions, we converted an in-house ethnographic research effort into remote family interviews, conducted from home and accompanied by diary studies.



To gain an in-depth understanding of attitudes and decision-making trade-offs, the research focus was not limited to the interviewee alone but deliberately included the whole family. Each interviewee would tell a story that would then become much more lively and precise with the corrections or additional details coming from wives, husbands, children, or sometimes even pets. We also focused on the relationships with other meaningful people (such as colleagues or distant family) and all the behaviors that resulted from those relationships. This wide research focus allowed us to shape a vivid mental image of dynamic situations with multiple actors. 



It’s essential that the scope of the research remains broad enough to be able to include all possible actors. Therefore, it normally works best to define broad research areas with macro questions. Interviews are best set up in a semi-structured way, where follow-up questions will dive into topics mentioned spontaneously by the interviewee. This open-minded “plan to be surprised” will yield the most insightful findings. When we asked one of our participants how his family regulated the house temperature, he replied, “My wife has not installed the thermostat’s app—she uses WhatsApp instead. If she wants to turn on the heater and she is not home, she will text me. I am her thermostat.”



3. Analysis: Create the Dynamic Selves



During the research analysis, you start representing each individual with multiple Dynamic Selves, each “Self” representing one of the contexts you have investigated. The core of each Dynamic Self is a quote, which comes supported by a photo and a few relevant demographics that illustrate the wider context. The research findings themselves will show which demographics are relevant to show. In our case, as our research focused on families and their lifestyle to understand their needs for thermal regulation, the important demographics were family type, number and nature of houses owned, economic status, and technological maturity. (We also included the individual’s name and age, but they’re optional—we included them to ease the stakeholders’ transition from personas and be able to connect multiple actions and contexts to the same person).







To capture exact quotes, interviews need to be video-recorded and notes need to be taken verbatim as much as possible. This is essential to the truthfulness of the several Selves of each participant. In the case of real-life ethnographic research, photos of the context and anonymized actors are essential to build realistic Selves. Ideally, these photos should come directly from field research, but an evocative and representative image will work, too, as long as it’s realistic and depicts meaningful actions that you associate with your participants. For example, one of our interviewees told us about his mountain home where he used to spend every weekend with his family. Therefore, we portrayed him hiking with his little daughter. 



At the end of the research analysis, we displayed all of the Selves’ “cards” on a single canvas, categorized by activities. Each card displayed a situation, represented by a quote and a unique photo. All participants had multiple cards about themselves.







4. Identify design opportunities



Once you have collected all main quotes from the interview transcripts and diaries, and laid them all down as Self cards, you will see patterns emerge. These patterns will highlight the opportunity areas for new product creation, new functionalities, and new services—for new design. 



In our example project, there was a particularly interesting insight around the concept of humidity. We realized that people don’t know what humidity is and why it is important to monitor it for health: an environment that’s too dry or too wet can cause respiratory problems or worsen existing ones. This highlighted a big opportunity for our client to educate users on this concept and become a health advisor.



Benefits of Dynamic Selves



When you use the Dynamic Selves approach in your research, you start to notice unique social relations, peculiar situations real people face and the actions that follow, and that people are surrounded by changing environments. In our thermostat project, we have come to know one of the participants, Davide, as a boyfriend, dog-lover, and tech enthusiast. 



Davide is an individual we might have once reduced to a persona called “tech enthusiast.” But we can have tech enthusiasts who have families or are single, who are rich or poor. Their motivations and priorities when deciding to purchase a new thermostat can be opposite according to these different frames. 



Once you have understood Davide in multiple situations, and for each situation have understood in sufficient depth the underlying reasons for his behavior, you’re able to generalize how he would act in another situation. You can use your understanding of him to infer what he would think and do in the contexts (or scenarios) that you design for.







The Dynamic Selves approach aims to dismiss the conflicted dual purpose of personas—to summarize and empathize at the same time—by separating your research summary from the people you’re seeking to empathize with. This is important because our empathy for people is affected by scale: the bigger the group, the harder it is to feel empathy for others. We feel the strongest empathy for individuals we can personally relate to.  



If you take a real person as inspiration for your design, you no longer need to create an artificial character. No more inventing details to make the character more “realistic,” no more unnecessary additional bias. It’s simply how this person is in real life. In fact, in our experience, personas quickly become nothing more than a name in our priority guides and prototype screens, as we all know that these characters don’t really exist. 



Another powerful benefit of the Dynamic Selves approach is that it raises the stakes of your work: if you mess up your design, someone real, a person you and the team know and have met, is going to feel the consequences. It might stop you from taking shortcuts and will remind you to conduct daily checks on your designs.



And finally, real people in their specific contexts are a better basis for anecdotal storytelling and therefore are more effective in persuasion. Documentation of real research is essential in achieving this result. It adds weight and urgency behind your design arguments: “When I met Alessandra, the conditions of her workplace struck me. Noise, bad ergonomics, lack of light, you name it. If we go for this functionality, I’m afraid we’re going to add complexity to her life.”



Conclusion



Designit mentioned in their article on Mindsets that “design thinking tools offer a shortcut to deal with reality’s complexities, but this process of simplification can sometimes flatten out people’s lives into a few general characteristics.” Unfortunately, personas have been culprits in a crime of oversimplification. They are unsuited to represent the complex nature of our users’ decision-making processes and don’t account for the fact that humans are immersed in contexts. 



Design needs simplification but not generalization. You have to look at the research elements that stand out: the sentences that captured your attention, the images that struck you, the sounds that linger. Portray those, use them to describe the person in their multiple contexts. Both insights and people come with a context; they cannot be cut from that context because it would remove meaning. 



It’s high time for design to move away from fiction, and embrace reality—in its messy, surprising, and unquantifiable beauty—as our guide and inspiration.

    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Beyond the severe toll of the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps no other disruption has transformed user experiences quite like how the tethers to our formerly web-biased era of content have frayed. We’re transitioning to a new world of remote work and digital content. We’re also experimenting with unprecedented content channels that, not too long ago, elicited chuckles at the watercooler, like voice interfaces, digital signage, augmented reality, and virtual reality.



Many factors are responsible. Perhaps it’s because we yearn for immersive spaces that temporarily resurrect the Before Times, or maybe it’s due to the boredom and tedium of our now-cemented stuck-at-home routines. But aural user experiences slinging voice content, and immersive user experiences unlocking new forms of interacting with formerly web-bound content, are no longer figments of science fiction. They’re fast becoming a reality in the here and now.



The idea of immersive experiences is all the rage these days, and content strategists and designers are now seriously examining this still-amorphous trend. Immersive experiences embrace concepts like geolocation, digital signage, and extended reality (XR). XR encompasses augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) as well as their fusion: mixed reality (MR). Sales of immersive equipment like gaming and VR headsets have skyrocketed during the pandemic, and content strategists are increasingly attuned to the kaleidoscope of devices and interfaces users now interact with on a daily basis to acquire information.



Immersive user experiences are becoming commonplace, and, more importantly, new tools and frameworks are emerging for designers and developers looking to get their hands dirty. But that doesn’t mean our content is ready for prime time in settings unbound from the web like physical spaces, digital signage, or extended reality. Recasting your fixed web content in more immersive ways will enable more than just newfangled user experiences; it’ll prepare you for flexibility in an unpredictable future as well.



Agnostic content for immersive experiences



These days, we interact with content through a slew of devices. It’s no longer the case that we navigate information on a single desktop computer screen. In my upcoming book Voice Content and Usability (A Book Apart, coming June 2021), I draw a distinction between what I call macrocontent—the unwieldy long-form copy plastered across browser viewports—and Anil Dash’s definition of microcontent: the kind of brisk, contextless bursts of content that we find nowadays on Apple Watches, Samsung TVs, and Amazon Alexas.



Today, content also has to be ready for contextless situations—not only in truncated form when we struggle to make out tiny text on our smartwatches or scroll through new television series on Roku but also in places it’s never ended up before. As the twenty-first century continues apace, our clients and our teams are beginning to come to terms with the fact that the way copy is consumed in just a few decades will bear no resemblance whatsoever to the prosaic browsers and even smartphones of today.



What do we mean by immersive content?



Immersive experiences are those that, according to Forrester, blur “the boundaries between the human, digital, physical, and virtual realms” to facilitate smarter, more interactive user experiences. But what do we mean by immersive content? I define immersive content as content that plays in the sandbox of physical and virtual space—copy and media that are situationally or locationally aware rather than rooted in a static, unmoving computer screen.



Whether a space is real or virtual, immersive content (or spatialcontent) will be a key way in which our customers and users deal with information in the coming years. Unlike voice content, which deals with time and sound, immersive content works with space and sight. Immersive content operates not along the axis of links and page changes but rather along situational changes, as the following figure illustrates.



In this illustration, each rectangle represents different displays that appear based on situational changes such as movement in space or adjustment of perspective that result in the delivery of different content from the previous context. One of these, such as the rightmost display, can be a web-enabled content display with links to other content presented in the same display. This illustration thus demonstrates two forms of navigation: traditional link navigation and immersive situational navigation.



Acknowledging the actual or imagined surroundings of where we are as human beings will have vast implications for content strategy, omnichannel marketing, usability testing, and accessibility. Before we dig deeper, let’s define a few clear categories of immersive content:



Digital signage content. Though it may seem a misnomer, digital signage is one of the most widespread examples of immersive content already in use today. For example, you may have seen it used to display a guide of stores at a mall or to aid wayfinding in an airport. While still largely bound to flat screens, it’s an example of content in space.Locational content. Locational content involves copy that is delivered to a user on a personal device based on their current location in the world or within an identified physical space. Most often mediated through Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacon technology or GPS location services, it’s an example of content at a point in space.Augmented reality content. Unlike locational content, which doesn’t usually adjust itself seamlessly based on how users move in real-world space, AR content is now common in museums and other environments—typically as overlays that are superimposed over actual physical surroundings and adjust dynamically according to the user’s position and perspective. It’s content projected into real-world space.Virtual reality content. Like AR content, VR content is dependent on its imagined surroundings in terms of how it displays, but it’s part of a nonexistent space that is fully immersive, an example of content projected into virtual space.Navigable content. Long a gimmicky playground for designers and developers interested in pushing the envelope, navigable content is copy that users can move across and sift through as if it were a physical space itself: true content as space.



The following illustration depicts these types of immersive content in their typical habitats.







Why auditing immersive content is important



Alongside conversational and voice content, immersive content is a compelling example of breaking content out of the limiting box where it has long lived: the browser viewport, the computer screen, and the 8.5”x11” or broadsheet borders of print media. For centuries, our written copy has been affixed to the staid standards of whatever bookbinders, newspaper printing presses, and screen manufacturers decided. Today, however, for the first time, we’re surmounting those arbitrary barriers and situating content in contexts that challenge all the assumptions we’ve made since the era of Gutenberg—and, arguably, since clay tablets, papyrus manuscripts, and ancient scrolls.



Today, it’s never been more pressing to implement an omnichannel content strategy that centers the reality our customers increasingly live in: a world in which information can end up on any device, even if it has no tether to a clickable or scrollable setting. One of the most important elements of such a future-proof content strategy is an omnichannel content audit that evaluates your content from a variety of standpoints so you can manage and plan it effectively. These audits generally consist of several steps:



Write a questionnaire. Each content item needs to be examined from the perspective of each channel through a series of channel-relevant questions, like whether content is legible or discoverable on every conduit through which it travels.Settle the criteria. No questionnaire is complete for a content audit without evaluation criteria that measure how the content performs and recommendation criteria that determine necessary steps to improve its efficacy.Discuss with stakeholders. At the end of any content audit, it’s important to leaf through the results and any recommendations in a frank discussion with stakeholders, including content strategists, editors, designers, and others.



In my previous article for A List Apart, I shared the work we did on a conversational content audit for Ask GeorgiaGov, the first (but now decommissioned) Alexa skill for residents of the state of Georgia. Such a content audit is just one facet of the multifaceted omnichannel content strategy along various dimensions you’ll need to consider. Nonetheless, there are a few things all content audits share in terms of foundational evaluation criteria across all content delivery channels:



Content legibility. Is the content readable or easily consumable from a variety of vantage points and perspectives? In the case of immersive content, this can include examining verbosity tolerance (how long content can be before users zone out, a big factor in digital signage) and phantom references (like links and calls to action that make sense on the web but not on a VR headset).Content discoverability. It’s no longer guaranteed in immersive content experiences that every piece of content can be accessed from other content items, and content loses almost all of its context when displayed unmoored from other content in digital signs or AR overlays. For discoverability’s sake, avoid relegating content to unreachable siloes, whether content is inaccessible due to physical conditions (like walls or other obstacles) or technical ones (like a finicky VR headset).



Like voice content, immersive content requires ample attention to the ways in which users approach and interact with content in physical and virtual spaces. And as I write in Voice Content and Usability, it’s also the case that cross-channel interactions can influence how we work with copy and media. After all, how often do subway and rail commuters glance up while scrolling through service advisories on their smartphones to consult a potentially more up-to-date alert on a digital sign?



Digital signage content: Content in space



Signage has long been a fixture of how we find our way through physical spaces, ever since the earliest roads crisscrossed civilizations. Today, digital signs are becoming ubiquitous across shopping centers, university campuses, and especially transit systems, with the New York City subway recently introducing countdown clocks that display service advisories on a ticker along the bottom of the screen, just below train arrival times.



Digital signs can deliver critical content at important times, such as during emergencies, without the limitations imposed by the static nature of analog signs. News tickers on digital signs, for instance, can stretch for however long they need to, though succinctness is still highly prized. But digital signage’s rich potential to deliver immersive content also presents challenges when it comes to content modeling and governance.



Are news items delivered to digital signs simply teaser or summary versions of full articles? Without a fully functional and configurable digital sign in your office, how will you preview them in context before they go live? To solve this problem for the New York City subway, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) manages all digital signage content across all signs within a central Drupal content management system (CMS), which synthesizes data such as train arrival times from real-time feeds and transit messages administered in the CMS for arbitrary delivery to any platform across the network.



How to present content items in digital signs also poses problems. As the following figure illustrates, do you overtake the entire screen at the risk of obscuring other information, do you leave it in a ticker that may be ignored, or do you use both depending on the priority or urgency of the content you’re presenting?







While some digital signs have the benefit of touch screens and occupying entire digital kiosks, many are tasked with providing key information in as little space as possible, where users don’t have the luxury of manipulating the interface to customize the content they wish to view. The New York City subway makes a deliberate choice to allow urgent alerts to spill across the entire screen, which limits the sign’s usefulness for those who simply need to know when the next train is arriving in the interest of more important information that is relevant to all passengers—and those who need captions for loudspeaker announcements.



Auditing for digital signage content



Because digital signs value brevity and efficiency, digital signage content often isn’t the main focus of what’s displayed. Digital signs on the São Paulo metro, for instance, juggle service alerts, breaking news, and health advisories. For this reason, auditing digital signage content for legibility and discoverability is key to ensuring users can interact with it gracefully, regardless of how often it appears, how highly prioritized it is, or what it covers.



When it comes to legibility, ask yourself these questions and consider the digital sign content you’re authoring based on these concerns:



Font size and typography. Many digital signs use sans-serif typefaces, which are easier to read from a distance, and many also employ uppercase for all text, especially in tickers. Consider which typefaces advance rather than obscure legibility, even when the digital sign content overtakes the entire screen.Angles and perspective. Is your digital sign content readily readable from various angles and various vantage points? Does the reflectivity of the screen impact your content’s legibility when standing just below the sign? How does your content look when it’s displayed to a user craning their neck and peering at it askew?Color contrast and lighting. Digital signs are no longer just fixtures of subterranean worlds; they’re above-ground and in well-lit spaces too. Color contrast and lighting strongly influence how legible your digital sign content can be.



As for discoverability, digital signs present challenges of both physical discoverability (can the sign itself be easily found and consulted?) and content discoverability (how long does a reader have to stare at the sign for the content they need to show up?):



Physical discoverability. Are signs placed in prominent locations where users will come across them? The MTA was criticized for the poor placement of many of its digital countdown clocks in the New York City subway, something that can block a user from ever accessing content they need.Content discoverability. Because digital signs can only display so much content at once, even if there’s a large amount of copy to deliver eventually, users of digital signs may need to wait too long for their desired content to appear, or the content they seek may be too deprioritized for it to show up while they’re looking at the sign.



Both legibility and discoverability of digital sign content require thorough approaches when authoring, designing, and implementing content for digital signs.



Usability and accessibility in digital signage content



In addition to audits, in any physical environment, immersive content on digital signs requires a careful and bespoke approach to consider not only how content will be consumed on the sign itself but also all the ways in which users move around and refer to digital signage as they consult it for information. After all, our content is no longer couched in a web page or recited by a screen reader, both objects we can control ourselves; instead, it’s flashed and displayed on flat screens and kiosks in physical spaces. 



Consider how the digital sign and the content it presents appear to people who use mobility aids such as wheelchairs or walkers. Is the surrounding physical environment accessible enough so that wheelchair users can easily read and discover the content they seek on a digital sign, which may be positioned too high for a seated reader? By the same token, can colorblind and dyslexic people read the chosen typeface in the color scheme it’s rendered in? Is there an aural equivalent of the content for Blind people navigating your digital signage, in close proximity to the sign itself, serving as synchronized captions?



Locational content: Content at a point in space



Unlike digital signage content, which is copy or media displayed in a space, locational (or geolocational) content is copy or media delivered to a device—usually a phone or watch—based on a point in space (if precise location is acquired through GPS location services) or a swath of space (typically driven by Bluetooth Low Energy beacons that have certain ranges). For smartphone and smartwatch users, GPS location services can often pinpoint a relatively accurate sense of where a person is, while Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons can triangulate their position based on devices that have Bluetooth enabled.







Though BLE beacons remain a fairly finicky and untested realm of spatial technology, they’ve quickly gained traction in large shopping centers and public spaces such as airports where users agree to receive content relevant to their current location, most often in the form of push notifications that whisk users away into a separate view with more comprehensive information. But because these tiny chunks of copy are often tightly contained and contextless, teams designing for locational content need to focus on how users interact with their devices as they move through physical spaces.



Auditing for locational content



Fortunately, because locational content is often delivered to the same visual devices that we use on a regular basis—smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets—auditing for content legibility can embrace many of the same principles we employ to evaluate other content. For discoverability, some of the most important considerations include:



Locational discoverability. BLE beacons are notorious for their imprecision, though they continue to improve in quality. GPS location, too, can be an inaccurate measure of where someone is at any given time. The last thing you want your customers to experience is an incorrect triangulation of where they are leading to embarrassing mistakes and bewilderment when unexpected content travels down the wire.Proximity. Because of the relative lack of precision when it comes to BLE beacons and GPS location services, placing content items too close together in a coordinate map may trigger too many notifications or resource deliveries to a user, thus overwhelming them, or a certain content item may inadvertently supersede another because they’re spaced too closely together.



As push notifications and location sharing become more common, locational content is rapidly becoming an important way to funnel users toward somewhat longer-form content that might otherwise go unnoticed when a customer is in a brick-and-mortar store.



Usability and accessibility in locational content



Because locational content requires users to move around physical spaces and trigger triangulation, consider how different types of users will move and also whether unforeseen issues can arise. For example, researchers in Japan found that users who walk while staring at their phones are highly disruptive to the flow and movement of those around them. Is your locational content possibly creating a situation where users bump into others, or worse, get into accidents? For instance, writing copy that’s quick and to the point or preventing notifications from being prematurely dismissed could allow users to ignore their devices until they have time to safely glance at them.



Limited mobility and cognitive disabilities can place many disabled users of locational content at a deep disadvantage. While gamification may encourage users to seek as many items of locational content as possible in a given span of time for promotional purposes, consider whether it excludes wheelchair users or people who encounter obstacles when switching between contexts rapidly. There are good use cases for locational content, but what’s compelling for some users might be confounding for others.



AR and VR content: Content projected into space



Augmented reality, once the stuff of science fiction holograms and futuristic cityscapes, is becoming more available to the masses thanks to wearable AR devices, high-performing smartphones and tablets, and innovation in machine vision capabilities, though the utopian future of true “holographic” content remains as yet unrealized. Meanwhile, virtual reality has seen incredible growth over the pandemic as homebound users—by interacting with copy and media in fictional worlds—increasingly seek escapist ways to access content normally spread across flat screens.



While AR and VR content is still in its infancy, the vast majority is currently couched in overlays that are superimposed over real-world environments or objects and can be opaque (occupying some of a device’s field of vision) or semi-transparent (creating an eerie, shimmery film on which text or media is displayed). Thanks to advancements in machine vision, these content overlays can track the motion of perceived objects in the physical or virtual world, bamboozling us into thinking these overlays are traveling in our fields of vision just like the things we see around us do.



Formerly restricted to realms like museums, expensive video games, and gimmicky prototypes, AR and VR content is now becoming much more popular among companies that are interested in more immersive experiences capable of delivering content alongside objects in real-life brick-and-mortar environments, as well as virtual or imagined landscapes, like fully immersive brand experiences that transport customers to a pop-up store in their living room.



To demonstrate this, my former team at Acquia Labs built an experimental proof of concept that examines how VR content can be administered within a CMS and a pilot project for grocery stores that explores what can happen when product information is displayed as AR content next to consumer goods in supermarket aisles. The following illustration shows, in the context of this latter experiment, how a smartphone camera interacts with a machine vision service and a Drupal CMS to acquire information to render alongside the item.







Auditing for AR and VR content



Because AR and VR content, unlike other forms of immersive content, fundamentally plays in the same sandbox as the real world (or an imaginary one), legibility and discoverability can become challenging. The potential risks for AR and VR content are in many regards a fusion of the problems found in both digital signage and locational content, encompassing both physical placement and visual perspective, especially when it comes to legibility:



Content visibility. Is the AR or VR overlay too transparent to comfortably read the copy or view the image contained therein, or is it so opaque that it obscures its surroundings? AR and VR content must coexist gracefully with its exterior, and the two must enhance rather than obfuscate each other. Does the way your content is delivered compromise a user’s feeling of immersion in the environment behind it?Content perspective. Unless you’re limited to a smartphone or similar handheld device, many AR and VR overlays, especially in immersive headsets, don’t display content or media as an immobile rectangular box, as it defeats the purpose of the illusion and can be jarring to users as they adjust their field of vision, breaking them out of the fantasy you’re hoping to create. For this reason, your AR or VR experience must not only dictate how environments and objects are angled and lit but also how the content associated with them is perceived. Is your content readable from various angles and points in the AR view or VR world?



When it comes to discoverability of your AR and VR content, issues like accuracy in machine vision and triangulation of your user’s location and orientation become much more important:



Machine vision. Most relevantly for AR content, if your copy or media is predicated on machine vision that perceives an object by identifying it according to certain characteristics, how accurate is that prediction? Does some content go undiscovered because certain objects go undetected in your AR-enabled device?Location accuracy. If your content relies on the user’s current location and orientation in relation to some point in space, as is common in both AR and VR content use cases, how accurately do devices dictate correct delivery at just the right time and place? Are the ranges within which content is accessible too limited, leading to flashes of content as you take a step to the left or right? Are there locations that simply can’t be reached, leading to forever-siloed copy or media?



Due to the intersection of technical considerations and design concerns, AR and VR content, like voice content and indeed other forms of immersive content, requires a concerted effort across multiple teams to ensure resources are delivered not just legibly but also discoverably.



Usability and accessibility in AR and VR content



Out of all the forms of immersive content we’ve covered so far, AR and VR content is possibly the medium that demands the most assiduously crafted solutions in accessibility testing and usability testing. Because AR and VR content, especially in headsets or wearable devices, requires motion through real or imagined space, its impact on accessibility cannot be overstated. Adding a third dimension—and arguably, a fourth: time—to our perception of content requires attention not only to how content is accessed but also all the other elements that comprise a fully immersive visual experience.



VR headsets commonly induce virtual reality motion sickness in many individuals. Poorly implemented transitions between states occurring in quick succession where content is visible and then invisible, and then visible again, can lead to epileptic seizures if not built with the utmost care. Finally, users moving quickly through spaces may inadvertently trigger vertigo in themselves or even collide with hazardous objects, resulting in potentially serious injuries. There’s a reason we aren’t wearing wearable headsets outside carefully secured environments.



Navigable content: Content as space



This is only the beginning of immersive content. Increasingly, we’re also toying with ideas that seemed harebrained even a few decades ago, like navigable content—copy and media that can be traversed as if the content itself were a navigable space. Imagine zooming in and out of tracts of text and stepping across glyphs like hopping between islands in a Super Mario game. Ambitious designers and developers are exploring this emerging concept of navigable content in exciting ways, both in and out of AR and VR. In many ways, truly navigable content is the endgame of how virtual reality presents information.



Imagining an encyclopedia that we can browse like the classic 1990s opening sequence of the BBC’s Eyewitness television episodes is no longer as far-fetched as we think. Consider, for instance, Robby Leonardi’s interactive résumé, which invites you to play a character as you learn about his career, or Bruno Simon’s ambitious portfolio, where you drive an animated truck around his website. For navigable content, the risks and rewards for user experience and accessibility remain largely unexplored, just like the hazy fringes of the infinite maps VR worlds make possible.



Conclusion



The story of immersive content is in its early stages. As newly emerging channels for content see greater adoption, requiring us to relay resources like text and media to never-before-seen destinations like digital signage, location-enabled devices, and AR and VR overlays, the demands on our content strategy and design approaches will become both fascinating and frustrating. As seemingly fantastical new interfaces continue to emerge over the horizon, we’ll need an omnichannel content strategy to guide our own journeys as creatives and to orient the voyages of our users into the immersive.



Content audits and effective content strategies aren’t just the domain of staid websites and boxy mobile or tablet interfaces—or even aurally rooted voice interfaces. They’re a key component of our increasingly digitized spaces, too, cornerstones of immersive experiences that beckon us to consume content where we are at any moment, unmoored from a workstation or a handheld. Because it lacks long-standing motifs of the web like context and clickable links, immersive content invites us to revisit our content with a fresh perspective. How will immersive content reinvent how we deliver information like the web did only a few decades ago, like voice has done in the past ten years?



Only the test of time, and the allure of immersion, will tell.

    <p class="article__summary">Global markets give you access to new customers. All you need to do is inform potential buyers about your product or service. 



Your website is a good place to introduce your product or service outside your locale. Localizing your web content sounds like the right way to reach out to the global market. Localization will bridge the language barriers, or the wider scope of differing cultures. 



Before we move on further with the discussion, let’s focus on the definition of “localization.” 



What is localization?



According to the Cambridge Dictionary, localization (as a marketing term) is “the process of making a product or service more suitable for a particular country, area, etc.,” while translation is “something that is translated, or the process of translating something, from one language to another.” 



In practice, the difference can be a little blurred. While it’s true that localization includes both language and non-language aspects, most cultural adjustments in the localization process are done through the language. Hence, the two terms are often interchangeable. 



Good translators will not simply find an equivalent of a word in another language. They will actively research their materials and have an in-depth understanding of the languages they work in. 



Depending on the situation, they may or may not convert measurement units and date formats. Technical guide books may need accurate unit conversion, but changing “Fahrenheit 451” to “Celsius 233” would be simply awkward. A good translator will suggest what to change and what to leave as it is. 



Some people call this conversion process “localization.” The truth is, unit conversions had become a part of translation, long before the word “localization” was used to describe the process. 



When we talk about linguistic versus non-linguistic aspects of a medium, and view them as separate entities, localization and translation may look different. However, when we look at the whole process of translating the message, seeing both elements as translatable items, the terms are interchangeable. 



In this article, the terms “localization” and “translation” will be used interchangeably. We are going to discuss how to use a website as a communication tool to gain a new market in different cultures. 



Localization: who is it for?



A good localization is not cheap, so it would be wise to ask yourselves several questions beforehand: 



Who is your audience?What kind of culture do they live in?What kind of problems may arise during the localization process? 



I will explain the details below. 



Who is your ideal audience?



Knowing your target audience should be at the top of your business plan. 



For some, localization is not needed because they live in the same region and speak the same language as their target market. For example, daycare services, local coffee shops, and restaurants. 



In some cases, people who live in the same region may speak different languages. In a bilingual society, you may want to cater to speakers of both languages as a sign of respect. In a multilingual society, aim to translate to the lingua franca and/or the language used by the majority. It makes people feel seen and it can create a positive image to your brand. 



Sometimes, website translation is required by law. In Quebec, for instance, where French is spoken as the provincial language, you’ll need to include a French version of your website. You may also want to check other types of linguistic experiences you need to provide. 



If your target market lives across the sea and speaks a different language, you may not have any choice but to localize. However, if those people can speak your  language, consider other aspects (cultural and/or legal) to make an informed decision on whether to translate.  



Although there are many benefits of website translation, you don’t always have to do it now. Especially when your budget is tight or you can spend it on something more urgent. It’s better to postpone than to have a badly translated website. The price of cheap translation is costly.  



If you’re legally required to launch a bilingual website but you don’t have the budget, you may want to check if you can be exempted. If you are not exempted, hire volunteers or seek government support, if possible. 



Unless required otherwise by law, there is nothing wrong with using your current language in your product or service. You can maintain the already-formed relationship by focusing on what you have in common: the same interest. 



Understanding cultural and linguistic intricacies



For example, you have a coding tutorial website. Your current audience is IT professionals—mostly college graduates. You see an opportunity to expand to India. 



Localization is unlikely to be needed in this case, as most Indian engineers have a good grasp of English. So, instead of doing a web translation project, you can use your money to improve or develop a new product or service for your Indian audience. Maybe you want to set up a workshop or a meetup in India. Or a bootcamp retreat in the country. 



You can achieve this by focusing on the similarities you have with your audience. 



The same rule applies to other countries where English language is commonly used by IT professionals. In the developing world, where English is rarely used, some self-taught programmers become “good hackers” to earn some money. You may wonder how, despite their lack of English skill, they can learn programming.



There’s an explanation for it. 



There are two types of language skills: passive (listening, reading) and active (speaking, writing). Passive language skills are usually learned first. Active language skills are developed later. You learn to speak by listening, and learn to write by reading. You go through this process as a child and, again, when you learn a new language as an adult. (This is not to confuse language acquisition with language learning, but to note that the process is relatively the same.) 



As most free IT course materials are available online in English, some programmers may have to adapt and study English (passively) as they go. They may not be considered “fluent” in a formal way, but it doesn’t mean they lack the ability to grasp the language. They may not be able to speak or write perfectly, but they can understand technical texts. 



In short, passive and active language skills can grow at different speeds. This fact leads you to a new group of potential audience: those who can understand English, but only passively. 



If your product is in a text format, translation won’t be necessary for this type of audience. If it’s an audio or video format, you may need to add subtitles, since native English speakers speak in so many different accents and at various speeds. Captioning will also help the hard of hearing. It may be required by regional or national accessibility legislation too. And it’s the right thing to do.



One might argue that if these people can understand English, they will understand the text better in their native tongue. 



Well, if all the programs you’re using or referring to are available in their native language version, it may not be a problem. But in reality, this is often not the case. 



Linguistic consistency helps programmers work faster. And this alone should trump the presumed ease that comes with translation. 



Some problems with localization 



I was once involved in a global internet company’s localization project in Indonesia. 



Indonesian SMEs mostly speak Indonesian since they mainly serve the domestic market. So, it was the right decision to target Indonesian SMEs using Indonesian language. 



The company had the budget to target Indonesia’s market of 58 million SMEs, and there weren’t too many competitors yet. I think the localization plan was justified. But even with this generally well-thought-out plan, there were some problems in its execution. 



The materials were filled with jargon and annoying outlinks. You could not just read an instruction until it was completed, because after a few words, you would be confronted with a “smart term.” Now to understand this smart term, you would have to follow a link that would take you to a separate page that was supposed to explain everything, but in that page you would find more smart terms that you’d need to click. At this point, the scent of information would have grown cold, and you’d likely have forgotten what you were reading or why. 



Small business owners are among the busiest folks you can find. They do almost everything by themselves. They would not waste their time trying to read pages of instructions that throw them right and left. 



Language-wise, the instructions could have been simplified. Design-wise, a hover/focus pop-up containing a brief definition or description could have been used to explain special terms. 



I agree pop-ups can be distracting, but in terms of ease, for this use case, they would have worked far better than outlinks. There are some ways to improve hover/focus pop-ups to make them more readable. 



However, if the content of those pop-ups (definition, description, etc.) cannot be brief, it is wiser to write it down as a separate paragraph. 



In my client’s case, they could have started each instruction by describing the definitions of those special terms. Those definitions ought to be written in one page so as to reduce the amount of time spent on clicking and returning to the intended page. This solution can also be applied when a definition is too long to be put inside a hover/focus bubble. 



The text problem, in my client’s case, came with the source language. It was later transferred to the target language thanks to localization. They could have solved the problem at the source language level, but I think it would have been too late at that point. 



Transcreation, i.e., “taking a concept in one language and completely recreating it in another language,” doesn’t solve a problem like this because the issue is more technical than linguistic. Translators would still have to adjust their work to the given environment. They’d still have to retain all the links and translate all jargon-laden content. 



The company should have hired a local writer to rewrite the content in the target language. It would have worked better. They didn’t take this route for a reason: namely, those “smart terms” were used as keywords. So as much as we hated them, we had to keep them there.  



How to prepare a web localization project



Let’s say you have considered everything. You’ve learned about your target audience, how your product will solve their problem, and that you have the budget to reach out to them. Naturally, you want to reach them now before your competitors do. 



Now you can proceed with your web localization project plan. 



One thing I want to repeat is that localization will transfer any errors you have in your original content to the translated pages. So you’ll need to do some content pre-checks before starting a web translation project. It will be cheaper to fix the problems before the translation project commences. 



Pre-localization checks should include assessing the text you intend to translate. Ask someone outside the team to read the text and ask them to give their feedback. It’s even better if that someone represents the target audience. 



Then make corrections, if need be. Use as little jargon as possible. Let readers focus on one article with no interruption. 



Some companies like to coin new terms to create keywords that will lead people to their sites. This can be a smart move, and it is arguably good for search engine optimization. But if you want to build rapport with your audience, you must make your message clear and understandable. Clear communication, not the invention of new words, should be your priority. 



Following this course of action might mean sacrificing keywords for clarity, but it also promises a lower bounce rate since visitors will stay longer on your site. After all, people are more likely to read your writing to the end if they are not being frustrated by difficult terms.



Once your text is ready, you can start your localization project. You can hire a language agency or build your own team. 



If you have a lot of content, it may be wise to outsource your project to a language agency. Doing so can save you time and money. An outside specialist consultancy will have the technology and skills to work on various types of localization projects. They can also translate your website to different languages at once. 



As an alternative, you might directly hire freelance editors and translators to work on your project. Depending on many factors, this might end up less or more expensive than hiring an agency. 



Make sure that the translators you hire, whether directly or through an agency, have relevant experience. If your text is about marketing, for instance, the translators and editors must be experts in this field. This is to make sure they can get your message across. 



Most translation tools used today can retain sentence formatting, links, and HTML code, so you don’t need to worry about these. 



Focus on the message you want to carry to your target audience. Be sensitive about cultural remarks and be careful about any potential misunderstanding caused by your translation. Consult with your language team about certain phrases that may become problematic when translated. Pick your words carefully. Choose the right expressions. 



If you localize a website, you must be sure to provide customer service support in target-friendly language. This allows you to reply to customers immediately, rather than having to wait for a translator to become involved.  



In summary, don’t be hasty when doing a web localization/translation project. There are a lot of things to consider beforehand. A well prepared plan will yield a better result. A good quality translation will not only bridge the language gap but it can also build trust and solidify your brand image in the mind of your target audience.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">Everyone wants to be an expert. But what does that even mean? Over the years I’ve seen two types of people who are referred to as “experts.” Expert 1 is someone who knows every tool in the language and makes sure to use every bit of it, whether it helps or not. Expert 2 also knows every piece of syntax, but they’re pickier about what they employ to solve problems, considering a number of factors, both code-related and not. 



Can you take a guess at which expert we want working on our team? If you said Expert 2, you’d be right. They’re a developer focused on delivering readable code—lines of JavaScript others can understand and maintain. Someone who can make the complex simple. But “readable” is rarely definitive—in fact, it’s largely based on the eyes of the beholder. So where does that leave us? What should experts aim for when writing readable code? Are there clear right and wrong choices? The answer is, it depends.



The obvious choice



In order to improve developer experience, TC39 has been adding lots of new features to ECMAScript in recent years, including many proven patterns borrowed from other languages. One such addition, added in ES2019, is Array.prototype.flat() It takes an argument of depth or Infinity, and flattens an array. If no argument is given, the depth defaults to 1.



Prior to this addition, we needed the following syntax to flatten an array to a single level.



let arr = [1, 2, [3, 4]];

[].concat.apply([], arr);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]



When we added flat(), that same functionality could be expressed using a single, descriptive function.



arr.flat();
// [1, 2, 3, 4]



Is the second line of code more readable? The answer is emphatically yes. In fact, both experts would agree.



Not every developer is going to be aware that flat() exists. But they don’t need to because flat() is a descriptive verb that conveys the meaning of what is happening. It’s a lot more intuitive than concat.apply().



This is the rare case where there is a definitive answer to the question of whether new syntax is better than old. Both experts, each of whom is familiar with the two syntax options, will choose the second. They’ll choose the shorter, clearer, more easily maintained line of code.



But choices and trade-offs aren’t always so decisive.



The gut check



The wonder of JavaScript is that it’s incredibly versatile. There is a reason it’s all over the web. Whether you think that’s a good or bad thing is another story.



But with that versatility comes the paradox of choice. You can write the same code in many different ways. How do you determine which way is “right”? You can’t even begin to make a decision unless you understand the available options and their limitations.



Let’s use functional programming with map() as the example. I’ll walk through various iterations that all yield the same result.



This is the tersest version of our map() examples. It uses the fewest characters, all fit into one line. This is our baseline.



const arr = [1, 2, 3];
let multipliedByTwo = arr.map(el =&gt; el * 2);
// multipliedByTwo is [2, 4, 6]



This next example adds only two characters: parentheses. Is anything lost? How about gained? Does it make a difference that a function with more than one parameter will always need to use the parentheses? I’d argue that it does. There is little to no detriment  in adding them here, and it improves consistency when you inevitably write a function with multiple parameters. In fact, when I wrote this, Prettier enforced that constraint; it didn’t want me to create an arrow function without the parentheses.



let multipliedByTwo = arr.map((el) =&gt; el * 2);



Let’s take it a step further. We’ve added curly braces and a return. Now this is starting to look more like a traditional function definition. Right now, it may seem like overkill to have a keyword as long as the function logic. Yet, if the function is more than one line, this extra syntax is again required. Do we presume that we will not have any other functions that go beyond a single line? That seems dubious.



let multipliedByTwo = arr.map((el) =&gt; {
  return el * 2;
});



Next we’ve removed the arrow function altogether. We’re using the same syntax as before, but we’ve swapped out for the function keyword. This is interesting because there is no scenario in which this syntax won’t work; no number of parameters or lines will cause problems, so consistency is on our side. It’s more verbose than our initial definition, but is that a bad thing? How does this hit a new coder, or someone who is well versed in something other than JavaScript? Is someone who knows JavaScript well going to be frustrated by this syntax in comparison?



let multipliedByTwo = arr.map(function(el) {
  return el * 2;
});



Finally we get to the last option: passing just the function. And timesTwo can be written using any syntax we like. Again, there is no scenario in which passing the function name causes a problem. But step back for a moment and think about whether or not this could be confusing. If you’re new to this codebase, is it clear that timesTwo is a function and not an object? Sure, map() is there to give you a hint, but it’s not unreasonable to miss that detail. How about the location of where timesTwo is declared and initialized? Is it easy to find? Is it clear what it’s doing and how it’s affecting this result? All of these are important considerations.



const timesTwo = (el) =&gt; el * 2;
let multipliedByTwo = arr.map(timesTwo);



As you can see, there is no obvious answer here. But making the right choice for your codebase means understanding all the options and their limitations. And knowing that consistency requires parentheses and curly braces and return keywords.



There are a number of questions you have to ask yourself when writing code. Questions of performance are typically the most common. But when you’re looking at code that is functionally identical, your determination should be based on humans—how humans consume code.



Maybe newer isn’t always better



So far we’ve found a clear-cut example of where both experts would reach for the newest syntax, even if it’s not universally known. We’ve also looked at an example that poses a lot of questions but not as many answers.



Now it’s time to dive into code that I’ve written before...and removed. This is code that made me the first expert, using a little-known piece of syntax to solve a problem to the detriment of my colleagues and the maintainability of our codebase.



Destructuring assignment lets you unpack values from objects (or arrays). It typically looks something like this.



const {node} = exampleObject;



It initializes a variable and assigns it a value all in one line. But it doesn’t have to.



let node
;({node} = exampleObject)



The last line of code assigns a variable to a value using destructuring, but the variable declaration takes place one line before it. It’s not an uncommon thing to want to do, but many people don’t realize you can do it.



But look at that code closely. It forces an awkward semicolon for code that doesn’t use semicolons to terminate lines. It wraps the command in parentheses and adds the curly braces; it’s entirely unclear what this is doing. It’s not easy to read, and, as an expert, it shouldn’t be in code that I write.



let node
node = exampleObject.node



This code solves the problem. It works, it’s clear what it does, and my colleagues will understand it without having to look it up. With the destructuring syntax, just because I can doesn’t mean I should.



Code isn’t everything



As we’ve seen, the Expert 2 solution is rarely obvious based on code alone; yet there are still clear distinctions between which code each expert would write. That’s because code is for machines to read and humans to interpret. So there are non-code factors to consider!



The syntax choices you make for a team of JavaScript developers is different than those you should make for a team of polyglots who aren’t steeped in the minutiae. 



Let’s take spread vs. concat() as an example.



Spread was added to ECMAScript a few years ago, and it’s enjoyed wide adoption. It’s sort of a utility syntax in that it can do a lot of different things. One of them is concatenating a number of arrays.



const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [9, 11, 13];
const nums = [...arr1, ...arr2];



As powerful as spread is, it isn’t a very intuitive symbol. So unless you already know what it does, it’s not super helpful. While both experts may safely assume a team of JavaScript specialists are familiar with this syntax, Expert 2 will probably question whether that’s true of a team of polyglot programmers. Instead, Expert 2 may select the concat() method instead, as it’s a descriptive verb that you can probably understand from the context of the code.



This code snippet gives us the same nums result as the spread example above.



const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [9, 11, 13];
const nums = arr1.concat(arr2);



And that’s but one example of how human factors influence code choices. A codebase that’s touched by a lot of different teams, for example, may have to hold more stringent standards that don’t necessarily keep up with the latest and greatest syntax. Then you move beyond the main source code and consider other factors in your tooling chain that make life easier, or harder, for the humans who work on that code. There is code that can be structured in a way that’s hostile to testing. There is code that backs you into a corner for future scaling or feature addition. There is code that’s less performant, doesn’t handle different browsers, or isn’t accessible. All of these factor into the recommendations Expert 2 makes.



Expert 2 also considers the impact of naming. But let’s be honest, even they can’t get that right most of the time.



Conclusion



Experts don’t prove themselves by using every piece of the spec; they prove themselves by knowing the spec well enough to deploy syntax judiciously and make well-reasoned decisions. This is how experts become multipliers—how they make new experts.



So what does this mean for those of us who consider ourselves experts or aspiring experts? It means that writing code involves asking yourself a lot of questions. It means considering your developer audience in a real way. The best code you can write is code that accomplishes something complex, but is inherently understood by those who examine your codebase.



And no, it’s not easy. And there often isn’t a clear-cut answer. But it’s something you should consider with every function you write.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">The Service Worker API is the Dremel of the web platform. It offers incredibly broad utility while also yielding resiliency and better performance. If you’ve not used Service Worker yet—and you couldn’t be blamed if so, as it hasn’t seen wide adoption as of 2020—it goes something like this:



On the initial visit to a website, the browser registers what amounts to a client-side proxy powered by a comparably paltry amount of JavaScript that—like a Web Worker—runs on its own thread.After the Service Worker’s registration, you can intercept requests and decide how to respond to them in the Service Worker’s fetch() event.



What you decide to do with requests you intercept is a) your call and b) depends on your website. You can rewrite requests, precache static assets during install, provide offline functionality, and—as will be our eventual focus—deliver smaller HTML payloads and better performance for repeat visitors.



Getting out of the woods



Weekly Timber is a client of mine that provides logging services in central Wisconsin. For them, a fast website is vital. Their business is located in Waushara County, and like many rural stretches in the United States, network quality and reliability isn’t great.



Figure 1. A wireless coverage map of Waushara County, Wisconsin. The tan areas of the map indicate downlink speeds between 3 and 9.99 Mbps. Red areas are even slower, while the pale and dark blue areas are faster.



Wisconsin has farmland for days, but it also has plenty of forests. When you need a company that cuts logs, Google is probably your first stop. How fast a given logging company’s website is might be enough to get you looking elsewhere if you’re left waiting too long on a crappy network connection.



I initially didn’t believe a Service Worker was necessary for Weekly Timber’s website. After all, if things were plenty fast to start with, why complicate things? On the other hand, knowing that my client services not just Waushara County, but much of central Wisconsin, even a barebones Service Worker could be the kind of progressive enhancement that adds resilience in the places it might be needed most.



The first Service Worker I wrote for my client’s website—which I’ll refer to henceforth as the “standard” Service Worker—used three well-documented caching strategies:



Precache CSS and JavaScript assets for all pages when the Service Worker is installed when the window’s load event fires.Serve static assets out of CacheStorage if available. If a static asset isn’t in CacheStorage, retrieve it from the network, then cache it for future visits.For HTML assets, hit the network first and place the HTML response into CacheStorage. If the network is unavailable the next time the visitor arrives, serve the cached markup from CacheStorage.



These are neither new nor special strategies, but they provide two benefits:



Offline capability, which is handy when network conditions are spotty.A performance boost for loading static assets.



That performance boost translated to a 42% and 48% decrease in the median time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), respectively. Better yet, these insights are based on Real User Monitoring (RUM). That means these gains aren’t just theoretical, but a real improvement for real people.



Figure 2. A breakdown of request/response timings depicted in Chrome’s developer tools. The request is for a static asset from CacheStorage. Because the Service Worker doesn’t need to access the network, it takes about 23 milliseconds to “download” the asset from CacheStorage.



This performance boost is from bypassing the network entirely for static assets already in CacheStorage—particularly render-blocking stylesheets. A similar benefit is realized when we rely on the HTTP cache, only the FCP and LCP improvements I just described are in comparison to pages with a primed HTTP cache without an installed Service Worker.



If you’re wondering why CacheStorage and the HTTP cache aren’t equal, it’s because the HTTP cache—at least in some cases—may still involve a trip to the server to verify asset freshness. Cache-Control’s immutable flag gets around this, but immutable doesn’t have great support yet. A long max-age value works, too, but the combination of Service Worker API and CacheStorage gives you a lot more flexibility.



Details aside, the takeaway is that the simplest and most well-established Service Worker caching practices can improve performance. Potentially more than what well-configured Cache-Control headers can provide. Even so, Service Worker is an incredible technology with far more possibilities. It’s possible to go farther, and I’ll show you how.



A better, faster Service Worker



The web loves itself some “innovation,” which is a word we equally love to throw around. To me, true innovation isn’t when we create new frameworks or patterns solely for the benefit of developers, but whether those inventions benefit people who end up using whatever it is we slap up on the web. The priority of constituencies is a thing we ought to respect. Users above all else, always.



The Service Worker API’s innovation space is considerable. How you work within that space can have a big effect on how the web is experienced. Things like navigation preload and ReadableStream have taken Service Worker from great to killer. We can do the following with these new capabilities, respectively:



Reduce Service Worker latency by parallelizing Service Worker startup time and navigation requests.Stream content in from CacheStorage and the network.



Moreover, we’re going to combine these capabilities and pull out one more trick: precache header and footer partials, then combine them with content partials from the network. This not only reduces how much data we download from the network, but it also improves perceptual performance for repeat visits. That’s innovation that helps everyone.



Grizzled, I turn to you and say “let’s do this.”



Laying the groundwork



If the idea of combining precached header and footer partials with network content on the fly seems like a Single Page Application (SPA), you’re not far off. Like an SPA, you’ll need to apply the “app shell” model to your website. Only instead of a client-side router plowing content into one piece of minimal markup, you have to think of your website as three separate parts:



The header.The content.The footer.



For my client’s website, that looks like this:



Figure 3. A color coding of the Weekly Timber website’s different partials. The Footer and Header partials are stored in CacheStorage, while the Content partial is retrieved from the network unless the user is offline.



The thing to remember here is that the individual partials don’t have to be valid markup in the sense that all tags need to be closed within each partial. The only thing that counts in the final sense is that the combination of these partials must be valid markup.



To start, you’ll need to precache separate header and footer partials when the Service Worker is installed. For my client’s website, these partials are served from the /partial-header and /partial-footer pathnames:



self.addEventListener(&quot;install&quot;, event =&gt; {
  const cacheName = &quot;fancy_cache_name_here&quot;;
  const precachedAssets = [
    &quot;/partial-header&quot;,  // The header partial
    &quot;/partial-footer&quot;,  // The footer partial
    // Other assets worth precaching
  ];

  event.waitUntil(caches.open(cacheName).then(cache =&gt; {
    return cache.addAll(precachedAssets);
  }).then(() =&gt; {
    return self.skipWaiting();
  }));
});



Every page must be fetchable as a content partial minus the header and footer, as well as a full page with the header and footer. This is key because the initial visit to a page won’t be controlled by a Service Worker. Once the Service Worker takes over, then you serve content partials and assemble them into complete responses with the header and footer partials from CacheStorage.



If your site is static, this means generating a whole other mess of markup partials that you can rewrite requests to in the Service Worker’s fetch() event. If your website has a back end—as is the case with my client—you can use an HTTP request header to instruct the server to deliver full pages or content partials.



The hard part is putting all the pieces together—but we’ll do just that.



Putting it all together



Writing even a basic Service Worker can be challenging, but things get real complicated real fast when assembling multiple responses into one. One reason for this is that in order to avoid the Service Worker startup penalty, we’ll need to set up navigation preload.



Implementing navigation preload



Navigation preload addresses the problem of Service Worker startup time, which delays navigation requests to the network. The last thing you want to do with a Service Worker is hold up the show.



Navigation preload must be explicitly enabled. Once enabled, the Service Worker won’t hold up navigation requests during startup. Navigation preload is enabled in the Service Worker’s activate event:



self.addEventListener(&quot;activate&quot;, event =&gt; {
  const cacheName = &quot;fancy_cache_name_here&quot;;
  const preloadAvailable = &quot;navigationPreload&quot; in self.registration;

  event.waitUntil(caches.keys().then(keys =&gt; {
    return Promise.all([
      keys.filter(key =&gt; {
        return key !== cacheName;
      }).map(key =&gt; {
        return caches.delete(key);
      }),
      self.clients.claim(),
      preloadAvailable ? self.registration.navigationPreload.enable() : true
    ]);
  }));
});



Because navigation preload isn’t supported everywhere, we have to do the usual feature check, which we store in the above example in the preloadAvailable variable.



Additionally, we need to use Promise.all() to resolve multiple asynchronous operations before the Service Worker activates. This includes pruning those old caches, as well as waiting for both clients.claim() (which tells the Service Worker to assert control immediately rather than waiting until the next navigation) and navigation preload to be enabled.



A ternary operator is used to enable navigation preload in supporting browsers and avoid throwing errors in browsers that don’t. If preloadAvailable is true, we enable navigation preload. If it isn’t, we pass a Boolean that won’t affect how Promise.all() resolves.



With navigation preload enabled, we need to write code in our Service Worker’s fetch() event handler to make use of the preloaded response:



self.addEventListener(&quot;fetch&quot;, event =&gt; {
  const { request } = event;

  // Static asset handling code omitted for brevity
  // ...

  // Check if this is a request for a document
  if (request.mode === &quot;navigate&quot;) {
    const networkContent = Promise.resolve(event.preloadResponse).then(response =&gt; {
      if (response) {
        addResponseToCache(request, response.clone());

        return response;
      }

      return fetch(request.url, {
        headers: {
          &quot;X-Content-Mode&quot;: &quot;partial&quot;
        }
      }).then(response =&gt; {
        addResponseToCache(request, response.clone());

        return response;
      });
    }).catch(() =&gt; {
      return caches.match(request.url);
    });

    // More to come...
  }
});



Though this isn’t the entirety of the Service Worker’s fetch() event code, there’s a lot that needs explaining:



The preloaded response is available in event.preloadResponse. However, as Jake Archibald notes, the value of event.preloadResponse will be undefined in browsers that don’t support navigation preload. Therefore, we must pass event.preloadResponse to Promise.resolve() to avoid compatibility issues.We adapt in the resulting then callback. If event.preloadResponse is supported, we use the preloaded response and add it to CacheStorage via an addResponseToCache() helper function. If not, we send a fetch() request to the network to get the content partial using a custom X-Content-Mode header with a value of partial.Should the network be unavailable, we fall back to the most recently accessed content partial in CacheStorage.The response—regardless of where it was procured from—is then returned to a variable named networkContent that we use later.



How the content partial is retrieved is tricky. With navigation preload enabled, a special Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload header with a value of true is added to navigation requests. We then work with that header on the back end to ensure the response is a content partial rather than the full page markup.



However, because navigation preload isn’t available in all browsers, we send a different header in those scenarios. In Weekly Timber’s case, we fall back to a custom X-Content-Mode header. In my client’s PHP back end, I’ve created some handy constants:



&lt;?php

// Is this a navigation preload request?
define(&quot;NAVIGATION_PRELOAD&quot;, isset($_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_SERVICE_WORKER_NAVIGATION_PRELOAD&quot;]) &amp;&amp; stristr($_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_SERVICE_WORKER_NAVIGATION_PRELOAD&quot;], &quot;true&quot;) !== false);

// Is this an explicit request for a content partial?
define(&quot;PARTIAL_MODE&quot;, isset($_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_X_CONTENT_MODE&quot;]) &amp;&amp; stristr($_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_X_CONTENT_MODE&quot;], &quot;partial&quot;) !== false);

// If either is true, this is a request for a content partial
define(&quot;USE_PARTIAL&quot;, NAVIGATION_PRELOAD === true || PARTIAL_MODE === true);

?&gt;



From there, the USE_PARTIAL constant is used to adapt the response:



&lt;?php

if (USE_PARTIAL === false) {
  require_once(&quot;partial-header.php&quot;);
}

require_once(&quot;includes/home.php&quot;);

if (USE_PARTIAL === false) {
  require_once(&quot;partial-footer.php&quot;);
}

?&gt;



The thing to be hip to here is that you should specify a Vary header for HTML responses to take the Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload (and in this case, the X-Content-Mode header) into account for HTTP caching purposes—assuming you’re caching HTML at all, which may not be the case for you.



With our handling of navigation preloads complete, we can then move onto the work of streaming content partials from the network and stitching them together with the header and footer partials from CacheStorage into a single response that the Service Worker will provide.



Streaming partial content and stitching together responses



While the header and footer partials will be available almost instantaneously because they’ve been in CacheStorage since the Service Worker’s installation, it’s the content partial we retrieve from the network that will be the bottleneck. It’s therefore vital that we stream responses so we can start pushing markup to the browser as quickly as possible. ReadableStream can do this for us.



This ReadableStream business is a mind-bender. Anyone who tells you it’s “easy” is whispering sweet nothings to you. It’s hard. After I wrote my own function to merge streamed responses and messed up a critical step—which ended up not improving page performance, mind you—I modified Jake Archibald’s mergeResponses() function to suit my needs:



async function mergeResponses (responsePromises) {
  const readers = responsePromises.map(responsePromise =&gt; {
    return Promise.resolve(responsePromise).then(response =&gt; {
      return response.body.getReader();
    });
  });

  let doneResolve,
      doneReject;

  const done = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    doneResolve = resolve;
    doneReject = reject;
  });

  const readable = new ReadableStream({
    async pull (controller) {
      const reader = await readers[0];

      try {
        const { done, value } = await reader.read();

        if (done) {
          readers.shift();

          if (!readers[0]) {
            controller.close();
            doneResolve();

            return;
          }

          return this.pull(controller);
        }

        controller.enqueue(value);
      } catch (err) {
        doneReject(err);
        throw err;
      }
    },
    cancel () {
      doneResolve();
    }
  });

  const headers = new Headers();
  headers.append(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/html&quot;);

  return {
    done,
    response: new Response(readable, {
      headers
    })
  };
}



As usual, there’s a lot going on:



mergeResponses() accepts an argument named responsePromises, which is an array of Response objects returned from either a navigation preload, fetch(), or caches.match(). Assuming the network is available, this will always contain three responses: two from caches.match() and (hopefully) one from the network.Before we can stream the responses in the responsePromises array, we must map responsePromises to an array containing one reader for each response. Each reader is used later in a ReadableStream() constructor to stream each response’s contents.A promise named done is created. In it, we assign the promise’s resolve() and reject() functions to the external variables doneResolve and doneReject, respectively. These will be used in the ReadableStream() to signal whether the stream is finished or has hit a snag.The new ReadableStream() instance is created with a name of readable. As responses stream in from CacheStorage and the network, their contents will be appended to readable.The stream’s pull() method streams the contents of the first response in the array. If the stream isn’t canceled somehow, the reader for each response is discarded by calling the readers array’s shift() method when the response is fully streamed. This repeats until there are no more readers to process.When all is done, the merged stream of responses is returned as a single response, and we return it with a Content-Type header value of text/html.



This is much simpler if you use TransformStream, but depending on when you read this, that may not be an option for every browser. For now, we’ll have to stick with this approach.



Now let’s revisit the Service Worker’s fetch() event from earlier, and apply the mergeResponses() function:



self.addEventListener(&quot;fetch&quot;, event =&gt; {
  const { request } = event;

  // Static asset handling code omitted for brevity
  // ...

  // Check if this is a request for a document
  if (request.mode === &quot;navigate&quot;) {
    // Navigation preload/fetch() fallback code omitted.
    // ...

    const { done, response } = await mergeResponses([
      caches.match(&quot;/partial-header&quot;),
      networkContent,
      caches.match(&quot;/partial-footer&quot;)
    ]);

    event.waitUntil(done);
    event.respondWith(response);
  }
});



At the end of the fetch() event handler, we pass the header and footer partials from CacheStorage to the mergeResponses() function, and pass the result to the fetch() event’s respondWith() method, which serves the merged response on behalf of the Service Worker.



Are the results worth the hassle?



This is a lot of stuff to do, and it’s complicated! You might mess something up, or maybe your website’s architecture isn’t well-suited to this exact approach. So it’s important to ask: are the performance benefits worth the work? In my view? Yes! The synthetic performance gains aren’t bad at all:



Figure 4. A bar chart of median FCP and LCP synthetic performance data across various Service Worker types for the Weekly Timber website.



Synthetic tests don’t measure performance for anything except the specific device and internet connection they’re performed on. Even so, these tests were conducted on a staging version of my client’s website with a low-end Nokia 2 Android phone on a throttled “Fast 3G” connection in Chrome’s developer tools. Each category was tested ten times on the homepage. The takeaways here are:



No Service Worker at all is slightly faster than the “standard” Service Worker with simpler caching patterns than the streaming variant. Like, ever so slightly faster. This may be due to the delay introduced by Service Worker startup, however, the RUM data I’ll go over shows a different case.Both LCP and FCP are tightly coupled in scenarios where there’s no Service Worker or when the “standard” Service Worker is used. This is because the content of the page is pretty simple and the CSS is fairly small. The Largest Contentful Paint is usually the opening paragraph on a page.However, the streaming Service Worker decouples FCP and LCP because the header content partial streams in right away from CacheStorage.Both FCP and LCP are lower in the streaming Service Worker than in other cases.



Figure 5. A bar chart of median FCP and LCP RUM performance data across various Service Worker types for the Weekly Timber website.



The benefits of the streaming Service Worker for real users is pronounced. For FCP, we receive an 79% improvement over no Service Worker at all, and a 63% improvement over the “standard” Service Worker. The benefits for LCP are more subtle. Compared to no Service Worker at all, we realize a 41% improvement in LCP—which is incredible! However, compared to the “standard” Service Worker, LCP is a touch slower.



Because the long tail of performance is important, let’s look at the 95th percentile of FCP and LCP performance:



Figure 6. A bar chart of 95th percentile FCP and LCP RUM performance data across various Service Worker types for the Weekly Timber website.



The 95th percentile of RUM data is a great place to assess the slowest experiences. In this case, we see that the streaming Service Worker confers a 40% and 51% improvement in FCP and LCP, respectively, over no Service Worker at all. Compared to the “standard” Service Worker, we see a reduction in FCP and LCP by 19% and 43%, respectively. If these results seem a bit squirrely compared to synthetic metrics, remember: that’s RUM data for you! You never know who’s going to visit your website on which device on what network.



While both FCP and LCP are boosted by the myriad benefits of streaming, navigation preload (in Chrome’s case), and sending less markup by stitching together partials from both CacheStorage and the network, FCP is the clear winner. Perceptually speaking, the benefit is pronounced, as this video would suggest:



Figure 7. Three WebPageTest videos of a repeat view of the Weekly Timber homepage. On the left is the page not controlled by a Service Worker, with a primed HTTP cache. On the right is the same page controlled by a streaming Service Worker, with CacheStorage primed.



Now ask yourself this: If this is the kind of improvement we can expect on such a small and simple website, what might we expect on a website with larger header and footer markup payloads?



Caveats and conclusions



Are there trade-offs with this on the development side? Oh yeah.



As Philip Walton has noted, a cached header partial means the document title must be updated in JavaScript on each navigation by changing the value of document.title. It also means you’ll need to update the navigation state in JavaScript to reflect the current page if that’s something you do on your website. Note that this shouldn’t cause indexing issues, as Googlebot crawls pages with an unprimed cache.



There may also be some challenges on sites with authentication. For example, if your site’s header displays the current authenticated user on log in, you may have to update the header partial markup provided by CacheStorage in JavaScript on each navigation to reflect who is authenticated. You may be able to do this by storing basic user data in localStorage and updating the UI from there.



There are certainly other challenges, but it’ll be up to you to weigh the user-facing benefits versus the development costs. In my opinion, this approach has broad applicability in applications such as blogs, marketing websites, news websites, ecommerce, and other typical use cases.



All in all, though, it’s akin to the performance improvements and efficiency gains that you’d get from an SPA. Only the difference is that you’re not replacing time-tested navigation mechanisms and grappling with all the messiness that entails, but enhancing them. That’s the part I think is really important to consider in a world where client-side routing is all the rage.



“What about Workbox?,” you might ask—and you’d be right to. Workbox simplifies a lot when it comes to using the Service Worker API, and you’re not wrong to reach for it. Personally, I prefer to work as close to the metal as I can so I can gain a better understanding of what lies beneath abstractions like Workbox. Even so, Service Worker is hard. Use Workbox if it suits you. As far as frameworks go, its abstraction cost is very low.



Regardless of this approach, I think there’s incredible utility and power in using the Service Worker API to reduce the amount of markup you send. It benefits my client and all the people that use their website. Because of Service Worker and the innovation around its use, my client’s website is faster in the far-flung parts of Wisconsin. That’s something I feel good about.

    <p class="article__summary">“Only a fool knows everything.”— African Proverb



Since March 2020, most of us have been working from home, and the days blend into each other and look the same. This is not the first time I have experienced this type of feeling. 



My commute — New York to New Jersey — is what folks in my area call the reverse commute.While going to the office, my days began to look the same: riding the subway to a bus to a shuttle to get to my job. Have you ever arrived at a destination and not even realized how you got there? This is how I began to experience the world everyday. I stopped paying attention to my surroundings.



Because I worked a lot, the only time I would take off was for the holidays. During this time, I was a consultant and was coming to the end of an existing contract. For six years straight, I did this, until I decided to take six weeks off work to travel to Europe and visit places I had not seen before.



A family friend let me stay with her in Munich, Germany; I did not speak German, and so began my adventure. I was in a new place, where I did not know anyone, and I got lost every single day. My eyes were opened to the fact that every day is an opportunity. It just took me going on a trip and traveling halfway around the world to realize it. There are new things to experience each and every day.



When I returned to the U.S. and went back to work, I made a conscious decision to make each day different. Sometimes I would walk a new route. Some days I would take another train. Each change meant I saw something new: new clothing, new buildings, and new faces. It really impacted the way I viewed myself in the world.



But what do you do when you cannot travel? Seeing a situation with new eyes takes practice, and you can still create the opportunity to see something by not taking your surroundings for granted.



How do we do this? For me, I adopted a new philosophy of being WOQE: watching, observing, questioning, and exploring.







Watching



Let go of assumptions to open up your mind. This takes looking at yourself and understanding your beliefs.



When I am looking to design something, I always have to tell myself that I am not the user. I don’t know where they come from, and I don’t know their reason for making the decisions they do. I begin the work to understand where they are coming from. It all starts with why.



Observing



View the situation from different angles. Architects think about the details of a building and look at different viewpoints and perspectives (i.e., outside the building, different sides of the building, etc.)



How can you apply this approach to your designs? Here’s an example. I sketched something once as part of an augmented reality experience. Using my mobile device, I was able to walk around the sketch and see it from all sides, including the top and bottom. As a UX Designer, I have had to view items from both a user’s perspective and the business’ perspective. If I am giving a talk at a conference, I look at the talk from an audience perspective and my own.



Questioning



Use the “5 Why Technique” to get to the root of the problem. This involves asking “why” 5 times.



You know how kids keep asking “why” when you answer a question from them? This approach is how you can get to the root of problems. For example, a friend of mine who is blind expressed interest in playing a popular augmented reality game. This intrigued me and I used a whiteboard as I worked through the 5 Whys with my friend. Here is the process we took:



“Why can’t someone who is blind play Pokémon Go?” I asked.“Because the game is visual and requires someone to see what is on the screen.”“Why is the game only a visual perspective?”“Because this is the way it was designed.”“Why was it designed this way?”“Because frequently designers are creating for themselves and may not think about who they might be excluding.”“Why are designers excluding people?”“Because they were never taught to include them.”“Why were they never taught?”“Design programs often do not include an inclusive and accessible curriculum.”



This may not be a scientific way of approaching a problem, but it is a starting point. My friend could not play this augmented reality game because designers were not taught to make this game for someone who is blind. After this exercise, I was able to work with a group of students who worked with my friend to create an augmented reality concept and ultimately a game using audio and haptic feedback.



It all started with why.



Exploring



Collaborate with others to learn from others and teach others what you know. Let your friends and colleagues know what you are working on, and perhaps talk it through with them.When I was a freelance designer, I worked on my own and found it challenging when I would get stuck on a design. I searched online and found a group of designers who would come and share their work with each other for feedback. Through this group, I was able to get some insightful comments on my designs and explain some of my decisions. I began to collaborate with the folks in the group and found it very helpful. When talking to clients, this made me feel more confident explaining my designs because I had already been through the process with my online group.



With all of our days blending into each other in this pandemic, we as designers have an unprecedented opportunity to really shake things up. Furthermore, we are problem solvers. As you move forward with your design practice, consider being WOQE to design with a fresh mind.

    <p class="article__summary">Maybe you’ve been part of a team that you’ve seen slowly slide into a rut. You didn’t notice it happen, but you’re now not shipping anything, no one’s talking to each other, and the management’s Eye of Sauron has cast its gaze upon you.



Maybe you’ve just joined a team that’s in the doldrums.



Maybe the people who used to oil the wheels that kept everyone together have moved on and you’re having to face facts—you all hate each other.



However you’ve ended up in this situation, the fact is that you’re now here and it’s up to someone to do something about it. And that person might be you.



You’re not alone



The first thing to understand is that you’re not the only person to ever encounter problems. Things like this happen all the time at work, but there are simple steps you can take and habits you can form to ease the situation and even dig yourself (and your team) out of the hole. I’ll share some techniques that have helped me, and maybe they can work for you, too.



So let me tell you a story about a hot mess I found myself in and how we turned it around. Names and details have been changed to protect the innocent.



It always starts out great



An engineer called Jen was working with me on a new feature on our product that lets people create new meal recipes themselves. I was the Project Manager. We were working in six-week cycles.



She had to rely on an API that was managed by Tom (who was in another team) to allow her to get and set the new recipe information on a central database. Before we kicked off, everyone knew the overall objective and everyone was all smiles and ready to go.



The system architecture was a legacy mishmash of different parts of local databases and API endpoints. And, no prizes for guessing what’s coming next, the API documentation was like Swiss cheese.



Two weeks into a six-week cycle, Jen hit Tom up with a list of her dream API calls that she wanted to use to build her feature. She asked him to confirm or deny they would work—or even if they existed at all—because once she started digging into the docs, it wasn’t clear to her if the API could support her plans.



However, Tom had form for sticking his head in the sand and not responding to requests he didn’t like. Tom went to ground and didn’t respond. Tom’s manager, Frankie, was stretched too thin, and hence wasn’t paying attention to this until I was persistently asking about it, in increasingly fraught tones.



In the meantime, Jen tried to do as much as she could. Every day she built a bit more based on her as-yet unapproved design, hoping it would all work out.



With two weeks left to go, Tom eventually responded with a short answer—which boiled down to “The API doesn’t support these calls and I don’t see why I should build something that does. Why don’t you get the data from the other part of the system? And by the way, if I’m forced to do this, it will take at least six weeks.”



And as we know, six weeks into two weeks doesn’t go. Problem.



How did we sort it?



Step 1 — Accept



When things go south, what do you do?



Accept it.



Acknowledge whatever has happened to get you into this predicament. Take some notes about it to use in team appraisals and retrospectives. Take a long hard look at yourself, too.



Write a concise, impersonal summary of where you are. Try not to write it from your point of view. Imagine that you’re in your boss’ seat and just give them the facts as they are. Don’t dress things up to make them sound better. Don’t over-exaggerate the bad. Leave the emotions to the side.



When you can see your situation clearly, you’ll make better decisions.



Now, pointing out the importance of taking some time to cool down and gather your thoughts seems obvious, but it’s based on the study of some of the most basic circuitry in our brains. Daniel Goleman’s 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, introduces the concept of emotional hijacking; the idea that the part of our brain that deals with emotion—the limbic system—can biologically interrupt rational thinking when it is overstimulated. For instance, experiments show that the angrier men get, the poorer are the decisions they make at the casino. And another study found that people in a negative emotional state are more likely to deviate from logical norms. To put it another way, if you’re pissed off, you can’t think straight.



So when you are facing up to the facts, avoid the temptation to keep it off-the-record and only discuss it on the telephone or in person with your colleagues. There’s nothing to be scared of by writing it down. If it turns out that you’re wrong about something, you can always admit it and update your notes. If you don’t write it down, then there’s always scope for misunderstanding or misremembering in future.



In our case, we summarized how we’d ended up at that juncture; the salient points were:



I hadn’t checked to ensure we had scoped it properly before committing to the work. It wasn’t a surprise that the API coverage was patchy, but I turned a blind eye because we were excited about the new feature.Jen should have looked for the hard problem first rather than do a couple of weeks’ worth of nice, easy work around the edges. That’s why we lost two weeks off the top.Tom and Frankie’s communication was poor. The reasons for that don’t form part of this discussion, but something wasn’t right in that team.



And that’s step one.



Step 2 — Rejoice



Few people like to make mistakes, but everyone will make one at some point in their life. Big ones, small ones, important ones, silly ones—we all do it. Don’t beat yourself up.







At the start of my career, I worked on a team whose manager had a very high opinion of himself. He was good, but what I learned from him was that he spread that confidence around the team. If something was looking shaky, he insisted that if we could “smell smoke,” that he had to be the first to know so he could do something about it. If we made a mistake, there was no hiding from it. We learned how to face up to it and accept responsibility, but what was more important was learning from him the feeling we were the best people to fix it.



There was no holding of grudges. What was done, was done. It was all about putting it behind us.



He would tell us that we were only in this team because he had handpicked us because we were the best and he only wanted the best around him. Now, that might all have been manipulative nonsense, but it worked.



The only thing you can control is what you do now, so try not to fret about what happened in the past or get anxious about what might happen in the future.



With that in mind, once you’ve written the summary of your sticky situation, set it aside!



I’ll let you in on a secret. No one else is interested in how you got here. They might be asking you about it (probably because they are scared that someone will ask them), but they’re always going to be more interested in how you’re going to sort the problem out.



So don’t waste time pointing fingers. Don’t prepare slide decks to throw someone under the bus. Tag that advice with a more general “don’t be an asshole” rule.



If you’re getting consistent heat about the past, it’s because you’re not doing a good enough job filling the bandwidth with a solid, robust, and realistic plan for getting out of the mess.



So focus on the future.



Sometimes it’s not easy to do that, but remember that none of this is permanent. Trust in the fact that if you pull it together, you’ll be in a much more powerful position to decide what to do next.



Maybe the team will hold together with a new culture or, if it is irretrievably broken, once you’re out of the hole then you can do something about it and switch teams or even switch jobs. But be the person who sorted it out, or at the very least, be part of the gang who sorted it out. That will be obvious to outsiders and makes for a much better interview question response.



In our story with Jen, we had a short ten-minute call with everyone involved on the line. We read out the summary and asked if anyone had anything to add.



Tom spoke up and said that he never gets time to update the API documentation because he always has to work on emergencies. We added that to our summary:



Tom has an ongoing time management problem. He doesn’t have enough time allocated to maintain and improve the API documentation.



After that was added, everyone agreed that the summary was accurate.



I explained that the worst thing that could now happen was that we had to report back to the wider business that we’d messed up and couldn’t hit our deadline.



If we did that, we’d lose face. There would be real financial consequences. It would show up on our appraisals. It wouldn’t be good. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it wasn’t something that we wanted. Everyone probably knew all that already, but there’s a power in saying it out loud. Suddenly, it doesn’t seem so scary.



Jen spoke up to say that she was new here and really didn’t want to start out like this. There was some murmuring in general support. I wrapped up that part of the discussion.



I purposefully didn’t enter into a discussion about the solution yet. We had all come together to admit the circumstances we were in. We’d done that. It was enough for now.



Step 3 — Move on



Stepping back for a second, as the person who is going to lead the team out of the wilderness, you may want to start getting in everyone’s face. You’ll be tempted to rely on your unlimited reserves of personal charm or enthusiasm to vibe everyone up. Resist the urge! Don’t do it!



Your job is to give people the space to let them do their best work.



I learned this the hard way. I’m lucky enough that I can bounce back quickly, but when someone is under pressure, funnily enough, a super-positive person who wants to throw the curtains open and talk about what a wonderful day it is might not be the most motivational person to be around. I’ve unwittingly walked into some short-tempered conversations that way.



Don’t micromanage. In fact, scrap all of your management tricks. Your job is to listen to what people are telling you—even if they’re telling you things by not talking.



Reframe the current problem. Break it up into manageable chunks.



The first task to add to your list of things to do is simply to “Decide what we’re going to do about [the thing].”



It’s likely that there’s a nasty old JIRA ticket that everyone has been avoiding or has been bounced back and forth between different team members. Set that aside. There’s too much emotional content invested in that ticket now.



Create a new task that’s entirely centered on making a decision. Now, break it down into subtasks for each member of the team, like “Submit a proposal for what to do next.” Put your own suggestions in the mix but do your best to dissociate yourself from them.



Once you start getting some suggestions back and can tick those tasks off the list, you start to generate positive momentum. Nurture that.



If a plan emerges, champion it. Be wary of naysayers. Challenge them respectfully with “How do you think we should…?” questions. If they have a better idea, champion that instead; if they don’t respond at all, then gently suggest “Maybe we should go with this if no one else has a better idea.”



Avoid words like “need,” “just,” “one,” or “small.” Basically, anything that imposes a view of other people’s work. It seems trivial, but try to see it from the other side.



Saying, “I just need you to change that one small thing” hits the morale-killing jackpot. It unthinkingly diminishes someone else’s efforts. An engineer or a designer could reasonably react by thinking “What do you know about how to do this?!” Your job is to help everyone drop their guard and feel safe enough to contribute.



Instead, try “We’re all looking at you here because you’re good at this and this is a nasty problem. Maybe you know a way to make this part work?”



More often than not, people want to help.



So I asked Jen, Tom, and Frankie to submit their proposals for a way through the mess.



It wasn’t straightforward. Just because we’d all agreed how we got here didn’t just magically make all the problems disappear. Tom was still digging his heels in about not wanting to write more code, and kept pushing back on Jen.



There was a certain amount of back and forth. Although, with some constant reminders that we should maybe focus on what will move us forward, we eventually settled on a plan.



Like most compromises, it wasn’t pretty or simple. Jen was going to have to rely on using the local database for a certain amount of the lower-priority features. Tom was going to have to create some additional API functions and would end up with some unnecessary traffic that might create too much load on the API.



And even with the compromise, Tom wouldn’t be finished in time. He’d need another couple of weeks.



But it was a plan!



N.B. Estimating is a whole other subject that I won’t cover here. Check out the Shape Up process for some great advice on that.



Step 4 — Spread the word



Once you’ve got a plan, commit to it and tell everyone affected what’s going on.



When communicating with people who are depending on you, take the last line of your email, which usually contains the summary or the “ask,” and put it at the top. When your recipient reads the message, the opener is the meat. Good news or bad news, that’s what they’re interested in. They’ll read on if they want more.



If it’s bad news, set someone up for it with a simple “I’m sorry to say I’ve got bad news” before you break it to them. No matter who they are, kindly framing the conversation will help them digest it.



When discussing it with the team, put the plan somewhere everyone can see it. Transparency is key.



Don’t pull any moves—like publishing deadline dates to the team that are two weeks earlier than the date you’ve told the business. Teams aren’t stupid. They’ll know that’s what you do.



Publish the new deadlines in a place where everyone on the team can see them, and say we’re aiming for this date but we’re telling the business that we’ll definitely be done by that date.



In our case, I posted an update to the rest of the business as part of our normal weekly reporting cycle to announce we’d hit a bump that was going to affect our end date.



Here’s an extract:



Hi everyone,Here’s the update for the week. I’m afraid there’s a bit of bad news to start but there is some good news too.First:We uncovered a misunderstanding between Jen and Tom this week. The outcome is that Tom has more API work to do than he anticipated. This affects the delivery date and means we’re now planning to finish 10 working days later on November 22.**Expected completion date ** CHANGED ****Original estimate: November 8Current estimate: November 22Second: We successfully released version 1.3 of the app into the App Store 🎉.



And so on...



That post was available for everyone within the team to see. Everyone knew what was to be done and what the target was.



I had to field some questions from above, but I was ready with my summary of what went wrong and what we’d all agreed to do as a course of action. All I had to do was refer to it. Then I could focus on sharing the plan.



And all manner of things shall be well



Now, I’d like to say that we then had tea and scones every day for the next month and it was all rather spiffing. But that would be a lie.



There was some more wailing and gnashing of teeth, but we all got through it and—even though we tried to finish early but failed—we did manage to finish by the November 22 date.



And then, after a bit of a tidy up, we all moved on to the next project, a bit older and a bit wiser. I hope that helps you if you’re in a similar scenario. Send me a tweet or email me at liam.nugent@hey.com with any questions or comments. I’d love to hear about your techniques and advice.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">The future of web-based software architectures is already taking form, and this time it’s server-rendered (again). Papa’s got a brand new bag: HTML-over-WebSockets and broadcast everything all the time.



The dual approach of marrying a Single Page App with an API service has left many dev teams mired in endless JSON wrangling and state discrepancy bugs across two layers. This costs dev time, slows release cycles, and saps the bandwidth for innovation.



But a new WebSockets-driven approach is catching web developers’ attention. One that reaffirms the promises of classic server-rendered frameworks: fast prototyping, server-side state management, solid rendering performance, rapid feature development, and straightforward SEO. One that enables multi-user collaboration and reactive, responsive designs without building two separate apps. The end result is a single-repo application that feels to users just as responsive as a client-side all-JavaScript affair, but with straightforward templating and far fewer loading spinners, and no state misalignments, since state only lives in one place. All of this sets us up for a considerably easier (and faster!) development path. 



Reclaiming all of that time spent addressing architecture difficulties grants you a pool of surplus hours that you can use to do awesome. Spend your dev budget, and your company’s salary budget, happily building full-stack features yourself, and innovating on things that benefit your company and customers. 



And in my opinion, there’s no better app framework for reclaiming tedious development time than Ruby on Rails. Take another look at the underappreciated Stimulus. Beef up the View in your MVC with ViewComponents. Add in the CableReady and StimulusReflex libraries for that Reactive Rails (as it has been dubbed) new car smell, and you’re off to the races. But we’ll get back to Rails in a bit...



This all started with web frameworks...



Web frameworks burst onto the scene around 2005 amidst a sea of mostly figure-it-out-for-yourself scripting language libraries glued together and thrown onto hand-maintained Apache servers. This new architecture promised developers a more holistic approach that wrapped up all the fiddly stuff in no-touch conventions, freeing developers to focus on programming ergonomics, code readability, and fast-to-market features. All a developer had to do was learn the framework’s core language, get up to speed on the framework itself and its conventions, and then start churning out sophisticated web apps while their friends were still writing XML configuration files for all those other approaches.



Despite the early criticisms that always plague new approaches, these server-rendered frameworks became tools of choice, especially for fast-moving startups—strapped for resources—that needed an attractive, feature-rich app up yesterday.



But then the JavaScript everything notion took hold...



As the web development world pushed deeper into the 2010s, the tides began to turn, and server-rendered frameworks took something of a backseat to the Single Page Application, wholly built in JavaScript and run entirely on the client’s computer. At many companies, the “server” became relegated to hosting an API data service only, with most of the business logic and all of the HTML rendering happening on the client, courtesy of the big ’ol package of JavaScript that visitors were forced to download when they first hit the site. 



This is where things started to get ugly.



Fast-forward to 2020 and the web isn’t getting any faster, as we were promised it would with SPAs. Shoving megabytes of JavaScript down an iPhone 4’s throat doesn’t make for a great user experience. And if you thought building a professional web app took serious resources, what about building a web app and an API service and a communication layer between them? Do we really believe that every one of our users is going to have a device capable of digesting 100 kB of JSON and rendering a complicated HTML table faster than a server-side app could on even a mid-grade server?



Developing and hosting these JavaScript-forward apps didn’t get any cheaper either. In many cases we’re now doing twice the work, and maybe even paying twice the developers, to achieve the same results we had before with server-side app development.



In 2005, app frameworks blew everyone’s minds with “build a blog app in 15 minutes” videos. Fifteen years later, doing the same thing with an SPA approach can require two codebases, a JSON serialization layer, and dozens of spinners all over the place so we can still claim a 50ms First Contentful Paint. Meanwhile, the user watches some blank gray boxes, hoping for HTML to finally render from all the JSON their browser is requesting and digesting. 



How did we get here? This is not my beautiful house! Were we smart in giving up all of that server-rendered developer happiness and doubling down on staff and the time to implement in order to chase the promise of providing our users some fancier user interfaces?



Well. Yes. Sort of.



We’re not building web software for us. We’re building it for them. The users of our software have expectations of how it’s going to work for them. We have to meet them where they are. Our users are no longer excited about full-page refreshes and ugly Rube Goldberg-ian multi-form workflows. The SPA approach was the next logical leap from piles of unorganized spaghetti JavaScript living on the server. The problem, though: it was a 5% improvement, not a 500% improvement. 



Is 5% better worth twice the work? What about the developer cost?



Bedazzling the web app certainly makes things fancier from the user’s perspective. Done well, it can make the app feel slicker and more interactive, and it opens up a wealth of new non-native interaction elements. Canonizing those elements as components was the next natural evolution. Gone are the days of thinking through how an entire HTML document could be mutated to give the illusion of the user interacting with an atomic widget on the page—now, that can be implemented directly, and we can think about our UX in terms of component breakdowns. But, alas, the costs begin to bite us almost immediately.



Go ahead, write that slick little rating stars component. Add some cool animations, make the mouseover and click area feel good, give some endorphin-generating feedback when a selection is made. But now what? In a real app, we need to persist that change, right? The database has to be changed to reflect this new state, and the app in front of the user’s eyes needs to reflect that new reality too. 



In the old days, we’d give the user a couple star GIFs, each a link that hit the same server endpoint with a different param value. Server-side, we’d save that change to the database, then send back a whole new HTML page for their browser to re-render; maybe we’d even get fancy and use AJAX to do it behind the scenes, obviating the need for the full HTML and render. Let’s say the former costs x in developer time and salary (and we won’t even talk about lost opportunity cost for features rolled out too late for the market). In that case, the fancy AJAX-based approach costs x + n (you know, some “extra JavaScript sprinkles”), but the cost of lots and lots of n grows as our app becomes more and more of a JavaScript spaghetti sprinkles mess.



Over in the SPA world, we’re now writing JavaScript in the client-side app and using JSX or Handlebars templates to render the component, then code to persist that change to the front-end data store, then a PUT request to the API, where we’re also writing an API endpoint to handle the request, a JSON serializer (probably with its own pseudo-template) to package up our successful response, and then front-end code to ensure we re-render the component (and some branching logic to maybe rollback and re-render the client-side state change if the backend failed on us). This costs a lot more than even x + n in developer time and salary. And if you’ve split your team into “front-end” and “back-end” people, you might as well go ahead and double that cost (both time and money) for many non-trivial components where you need two different people to finish the implementation. Sure, the SPA mitigates some of the ever-growing spaghetti problem, but at what cost for a business racing to be relevant in the market or get something important out to the people who need it?



One of the other arguments we hear in support of the SPA is the reduction in cost of cyber infrastructure. As if pushing that hosting burden onto the client (without their consent, for the most part, but that’s another topic) is somehow saving us on our cloud bills. But that’s ridiculous. For any non-trivial application, you’re still paying for a server to host the API and maybe another for the database, not to mention load balancers, DNS, etc. And here’s the thing: none of that cost even comes close to what a software company pays its developers! Seriously, think about it. I’ve yet to work at any business where our technical infrastructure was anything more than a fraction of our salary overhead. And good developers expect raises. Cloud servers generally just get cheaper over time.



If you want to be efficient with your money—especially as a cash-strapped startup—you don’t need to cheap out on cloud servers; you need to get more features faster out of your existing high-performance team.



In the old, old days, before the web frameworks, you’d pay a developer for six weeks to finally unveil…the log-in page. Cue the sad trombone. Then frameworks made that log-in page an hour of work, total, and people were launching web startups overnight. The trumpets sound! Now, with our SPA approach, we’re back to a bunch of extra work. It’s costing us more money because we’re writing two apps at once. There’s that trombone again...



We’re paying a lot of money for that 5% user experience improvement.



But what if we could take the best client-side JavaScript ideas and libraries from that 5% improvement and reconnect them with the developer ergonomics and salary savings of a single codebase? What if components and organized JavaScript could all live in one rock-solid app framework optimized for server-side rendering? What if there is a path to a 500% jump?



Sound impossible? It’s not. I’ve seen it, like C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I’ve built that 500% app, in my free time, with my kids running around behind me barking like dogs. Push broadcasts to logged-in users. Instant updates to the client-side DOM in milliseconds. JavaScript-driven 3D animations that interact with real-time chat windows. All in a single codebase, running on the same server hardware I’d use for a “classic” server-rendered app (and maybe I can even scale that hardware down since I’m rendering HTML fragments more often than full-page documents). No separate front-end app. Clean, componentized JavaScript and server-side code, married like peanut butter and jelly. It’s real, I tell you!



Socket to me! (Get it? Get it? Ah, nevermind...)



Finalized in 2011, support for WebSockets in modern browsers ramped up throughout the 2010s and is now fully supported in all modern browsers. With the help of a small bit of client-side JavaScript, you get a full-duplex socket connection between browser and server. Data can pass both ways, and can be pushed from either side at any time, no user-initiated request needed.



Like the game industry’s ever-expanding moves into cloud-based gaming, the future of web apps is not going to be about pushing even heavier obligations onto the user/client, but rather the opposite: let the client act as a thin terminal that renders the state of things for the human. WebSockets provide the communication layer, seamless and fast; a direct shot from the server to the human.



But this wasn’t terribly easy for many developers to grok at first. I sure didn’t. And the benefits weren’t exactly clear either. After years (decades, even) of wrapping our heads around the HTTP request cycle, to which all server-handled features must conform, adopting this WebSocket tech layer required a lot of head scratching. As with many clever new technologies or protocols, we needed a higher-level abstraction that provided something really effective for getting a new feature in front of a user, fast.



Enter HTML-over-WebSockets...



Want a hyper-responsive datalist typeahead that is perfectly synced with the database? On every keystroke, send a query down the WebSocket and get back precisely the changed set of option tags, nothing more, nothing less.



How about client-side validations? Easy. On every input change, round up the form values and send ’em down the WebSocket. Let your server framework validate and send back changes to the HTML of the form, including any errors that need to be rendered. No need for JSON or complicated error objects.



User presence indicators? Dead simple. Just check who has an active socket connection.



What about multi-user chat? Or document collaboration? In classic frameworks and SPAs, these are the features we put off because of their difficulty and the code acrobatics needed to keep everyone’s states aligned. With HTML-over-the-wire, we’re just pushing tiny bits of HTML based on one user’s changes to every other user currently subscribed to the channel. They’ll see exactly the same thing as if they hit refresh and asked the server for the entire HTML page anew. And you can get those bits to every user in under 30ms.



We’re not throwing away the promise of components either. Where this WebSockets-based approach can be seen as a thick server/thin client, so too can our components. It’s fractal, baby! Make that component do delightful things for the user with smart JavaScript, and then just ask the server for updated HTML, and mutate the DOM. No need for a client-side data store to manage the component’s state since it’ll render itself to look exactly like what the server knows it should look like now. The HTML comes from the server, so no need for JSX or Handlebars or &lt;insert other JavaScript templating library here&gt;. The server is always in control: rendering the initial component’s appearance and updating it in response to any state change, all through the socket. 



And there’s nothing saying you have to use those socket channels to send only HTML. Send a tiny bit of text, and have the client do something smart. Send a chat message from one user to every other user, and have their individual clients render that message in whatever app theme they’re currently using. Imagine the possibilities!



But it’s complex/expensive/requires a bunch of new infrastructure, right?



Nope. Prominent open-source web servers support it natively, generally without needing any kind of extra configuration or setup. Many server-side frameworks will automatically ship the JS code to the client for native support in communicating over the socket. In Rails, for example, setting up your app to use WebSockets is as easy as configuring the built-in ActionCable and then deploying as usual on the same hardware you would have used otherwise. Anecdotally, the typical single Rails server process seems to be perfectly happy supporting nearly 4,000 active connections. And you can easily swap in the excellent AnyCable to bump that up to around 10,000+ connections per node by not relying on the built-in Ruby WebSocket server. Again, this is on the usual hardware you’d be running your web server on in the first place. You don’t need to set up any extra hardware or increase your cloud infrastructure.



This new approach is quickly appearing as extensions, libraries, or alternative configurations in a variety of languages and web frameworks, from Django’s Sockpuppet to Phoenix’s LiveView and beyond. Seriously, go dig around for WebSockets-based libraries for your favorite app framework and then step into a new way of thinking about your app architectures. Build something amazing and marvel at the glorious HTML bits zipping along on the socket, like jet fighters passing in the night. It’s more than a new technical approach; it’s a new mindset, and maybe even a new wellspring of key app features that will drive your startup success.



But I’d be remiss if I didn’t highlight for the reader my contender for Best Framework in a Leading Role. Sure, any app framework can adopt this approach, but for my money, there’s a strong case to be made that the vanguard could be Ruby on Rails. 



So we come back around to Rails, 15 years on from its launch...



Set up a Rails 6 app with the latest versions of Turbolinks, Stimulus, StimulusReflex, CableReady, and GitHub’s ViewComponent gem, and you can be working with Reactive Rails in a way that simultaneously feels like building a classic Rails app and like building a modern, componentized SPA, in a single codebase, with all the benefits of server-side rendering, HTML fragment caching, easy SEO, rock-solid security, and the like. You’ll suddenly find your toolbelt bursting with straightforward tools to solve previously daunting challenges.



Oh, and with Turbolinks, you also get wrappers allowing for hybrid native/HTML UIs in the same codebase. Use a quick deploy solution like Heroku or Hatchbox, and one developer can build a responsive, reactive, multi-platform app in their spare time. Just see this Twitter clone if you don’t believe me. 



OK, that all sounds exciting, but why Rails specifically? Isn’t it old and boring? You already said any framework can benefit from this new WebSocket, DOM-morphing approach, right? 



Sure. But where Rails has always shined is in its ability to make rapid prototyping, well…rapid, and in its deep ecosystem of well-polished gems. Rails also hasn’t stopped pushing the envelope forward, with the latest version 6.1.3 of the framework boasting a ton of cool features. 



If you’ve got a small, resource-strapped team, Rails (and Ruby outside of the framework) still serves as a potent force multiplier that lets you punch way above your weight, which probably explains the $92 billion in revenue it’s helped drive over the years. With this new approach, there’s a ton more weight behind that punch. While your competitors are fiddling with their JSON serializers and struggling to optimize away all the loading spinners, you’re rolling out a new multi-user collaborative feature every week…or every day. 



You win. Your fellow developers win. Your business wins. And, most importantly, your users win.



That’s what Rails promised from the day it was released to the community. That’s why Rails spawned so many imitators in other languages, and why it saw such explosive growth in the startup world for years. And that same old rapid prototyping spirit, married to this new HTML-over-the-wire approach, positions Rails for a powerful resurgence. 



Ruby luminary and author of The Ruby Way, Obie Fernandez, seems to think so.



Heck, even Russ Hanneman thinks this approach with StimulusReflex is the new hotness.



And the good folks over at Basecamp (creators of Rails in the first place), dropped their own take on the concept, Hotwire, just in time for the 2020 holidays, so your options for tackling this new and exciting technique continue to expand.



Don’t call it a comeback, because Rails has been here for years. With this new architectural approach, brimming with HTML-over-WebSockets and full-duplex JavaScript interactions, Rails becomes something new, something beautiful, something that demands attention (again). 



Reactive Rails, with StimulusReflex and friends, is a must-look for anyone exhausted from toiling with JSON endpoints or JSX, and I’m super excited to see the new crop of apps that it enables.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">In the 1920s, Robert Moses designed a system of parkways surrounding New York City. His designs, which included overpasses too low for public buses, have become an often-cited example of exclusionary design and are argued by biographer Robert A. Caro to represent a purposeful barrier between the city’s Black and Puerto Rican residents and nearby beaches. 



Regardless of the details of Moses’s parkway project, it’s a particularly memorable reminder of the political power of design and the ways that choices can exclude various groups based on abilities and resources. The growing interest in inclusive design highlights questions of who can participate, and in relation to the web, this has often meant a focus on accessibility and user experience, as well as on questions related to team diversity and governance. 



But principles of inclusive design should also play a role early in the design and development process, during content modeling. Modeling defines what content objects consist of and, by extension, who will be able to create them. So if web professionals are interested in inclusion, we need to go beyond asking who can access content and also think about how the design of content can install barriers that make it difficult for some people to participate in creation. 



Currently, content models are primarily seen as mirrors that reflect inherent structures in the world. But if the world is biased or exclusionary, this means our content models will be too. Instead, we need to approach content modeling as an opportunity to filter out harmful structures and create systems in which more people can participate in making the web. Content models designed for inclusivity welcome a variety of voices and can ultimately increase products’ diversity and reach.



Content models as mirrors



Content models are tools for describing the objects that will make up a project, their attributes, and the possible relations between them. A content model for an art museum, for example, would typically describe, among other things, artists (including attributes such as name, nationality, and perhaps styles or schools), and artists could then be associated with artworks, exhibitions, etc. (The content model would also likely include objects like blog posts, but in this article we’re interested in how we model and represent objects that are “out there” in the real world, rather than content objects like articles and quizzes that live natively on websites and in apps.)



The common wisdom when designing content models is to go out and research the project’s subject domain by talking with subject matter experts and project stakeholders. As Mike Atherton and Carrie Hane describe the process in Designing Connected Content, talking with the people who know the most about a subject domain (like art in the museum example above) helps to reveal an “inherent” structure, and discovering or revealing that structure ensures that your content is complete and comprehensible.



Additional research might go on to investigate how a project’s end users understand a domain, but Atherton and Hane describe this stage as mostly about terminology and level of detail. End users might use a different word than experts do or care less about the nuanced distinctions between Fauvism and neo-Expressionism, but ultimately, everybody is talking about the same thing. A good content model is just a mirror that reflects the structure you find.  



Cracks in the mirrors



The mirror approach works well in many cases, but there are times when the structures that subject matter experts perceive as inherent are actually the products of biased systems that quietly exclude. Like machine learning algorithms trained on past school admissions or hiring decisions, existing structures tend to work for some people and harm others. Rather than recreating these structures, content modelers should consider ways to improve them. 



A basic example is LinkedIn’s choice to require users to specify a company when creating a new work experience. Modeling experience in this way is obvious to HR managers, recruiters, and most people who participate in conventional career paths, but it assumes that valuable experience is only obtained through companies, and could potentially discourage people from entering other types of experiences that would allow them to represent alternative career paths and shape their own stories.



Figure 1. LinkedIn’s current model for experience includes Company as a required attribute.




These kinds of mismatches between required content attributes and people’s experiences either create explicit barriers (“I can’t participate because I don’t know how to fill in this field”) or increase the labor required to participate (“It’s not obvious what I should put here, so I’ll have to spend time thinking of a workaround”). 



Setting as optional fields that might not apply to everyone is one inclusive solution, as is increasing the available options for responses requiring a selection. However, while gender-inclusive choices provide an inclusive way to handle form inputs, it’s also worth considering when business objectives would be met just as well by providing open text inputs that allow users to describe themselves in their own terms. 



Instead of LinkedIn’s highly prescribed content, for example, Twitter bios’ lack of structure lets people describe themselves in more inclusive ways. Some people use the space to list formal credentials, while others provide alternate forms of identification (e.g., mother, cyclist, or coffee enthusiast) or jokes. Because the content is unstructured, there are fewer expectations about its use, taking pressure off those who don’t have formal credentials and giving more flexibility to those who do. 



Browsing the Twitter bios of designers, for example, reveals a range of identification strategies, from listing credentials and affiliations to providing broad descriptions. 



Figure 2. Veerle Pieters’s Twitter bio uses credentials, affiliations, and personal interests. 



Figure 3. Jason Santa Maria’s Twitter bio uses a broad description. 



Figure 4. Erik Spiekermann’s Twitter bio uses a single word.



In addition to considering where structured content might exclude, content modelers should also consider how length guidelines can implicitly create barriers for content creators. In the following section, we look at a project in which we chose to reduce the length of contributor bios as a way to ensure that our content model didn’t leave anyone out. 



Live in America



Live in America is a performing arts festival scheduled to take place in October 2021 in Bentonville, Arkansas. The goal of the project is to survey the diversity of live performance from across the United States, its territories, and Mexico, and bring together groups of artists that represent distinct local traditions. Groups of performers will come from Alabama, Las Vegas, Detroit, and the border city of El Paso–Juárez. Indigineous performers from Albuquerque are scheduled to put on a queer powwow. Performers from Puerto Rico will organize a cabaret. 



An important part of the festival’s mission is that many of the performers involved aren’t integrated into the world of large art institutions, with their substantial fiscal resources and social connections. Indeed, the project’s purpose is to locate and showcase examples of live performance that fly under curators’ radars and that, as a result of their lack of exposure, reveal what makes different communities truly unique. 



As we began to think about content modeling for the festival’s website, these goals had two immediate consequences:



First, the idea of exploring the subject domain of live performance doesn’t exactly work for this project because the experts we might have approached would have told us about a version of the performing arts world that festival organizers were specifically trying to avoid. Experts’ mental models of performers, for example, might include attributes like residencies, fellowships and grants, curricula vitae and awards, artist statements and long, detailed bios. All of these attributes might be perceived as inherent or natural within one, homogenous community—but outside that community they’re not only a sign of misalignment, they represent barriers to participation.



Second, the purposeful diversity of festival participants meant that locating a shared mental model wasn’t the goal. Festival organizers want to preserve the diversity of the communities involved, not bring them all together or show how they’re the same. It’s important that people in Las Vegas think about performance differently than people in Alabama and that they structure their projects and working relationships in distinct ways. 



Content modeling for Live in America involved defining what a community is, what a project is, and how these are related. But one of the most interesting challenges we faced was how to model a person—what attributes would stand in for the people that would make the event possible. 



It was important that we model participants in a way that preserved and highlighted diversity and also in a way that included everyone—that let everyone take part in their own way and that didn’t overburden some people or ask them to experience undue anxiety or perform extra work to make themselves fit within a model of performance that didn’t match their own. 



Designing an inclusive content model for Live in America meant thinking hard about what a bio would look like. Some participants come from the institutionalized art world, where bios are long and detailed and often engage in intricate and esoteric forms of credentialing. Other participants create art but don’t have the same resources. Others are just people who were chosen to speak for and about their communities: writers, chefs, teachers, and musicians. 



The point of the project is to highlight both performance that has not been recognized and the people who have not been recognized for making it. Asking for a written form that has historically been built around institutional recognition would only highlight the hierarchies that festival organizers want to leave behind.



The first time we brought up the idea of limiting bios to five words, our immediate response was, “Can we get away with that?” Would some artists balk at not being allowed the space to list their awards? It’s a ridiculously simple idea, but it also gets at the heart of content modeling: what are the things and how do we describe them? What are the formats and limitations that we put on the content that would be submitted to us? What are we asking of the people who will write the content? How can we configure the rules so that everyone can participate?



Five-word bios place everyone on the same ground. They ask everyone to create something new but also manageable. They’re comparable. They set well-known artists next to small-town poets, and let them play together. They let in diverse languages, but keep out the historical structures that set people apart. They’re also fun:



Byron F. Aspaas of Albuquerque is “Diné. Táchii&#039;nii nishłį́ Tódichii&#039;nii bashishchiin.”Danny R.W. Baskin of Northwest Arkansas is “Baroque AF but eating well.”Brandi Dobney of New Orleans is “Small boobs, big dreams.”Imani Mixon of Detroit is “best dresser, dream catcher, storyteller.”Erika P. Rodríguez of Puerto Rico is “Anti-Colonialist Photographer. Caribeña. ♡ Ice Cream.”David Dorado Romo of El Paso–Juárez is “Fonterizo historian wordsmith saxophonist glossolalian.”Mikayla Whitmore of Las Vegas is “hold the mayo, thank you.”Mary Zeno of Alabama is “a down home folk poet.”



Modeling for inclusion



We tend to think of inclusive design in terms of removing barriers to access, but content modeling also has an important role to play in ensuring that the web is a place where there are fewer barriers to creating content, especially for people with diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. This might involve rethinking the use of structured content or asking how length guidelines might create burdens for some people. But regardless of the tactics, designing inclusive content models begins by acknowledging the political work that these models perform and asking whom they include or exclude from participation. 



All modeling is, after all, the creation of a world. Modelers establish what things exist and how they relate to each other. They make some things impossible and others so difficult that they might as well be. They let some people in and keep others out. Like overpasses that prevent public buses from reaching the beach, exclusionary models can quietly shape the landscape of the web, exacerbating the existing lack of diversity and making it harder for those who are already underrepresented to gain entry.



As discussions of inclusive design continue to gain momentum, content modeling should play a role precisely because of the world-building that is core to the process. If we’re building worlds, we should build worlds that let in as many people as possible. To do this, our discussions of content modeling need to include an expanded range of metaphors that go beyond just mirroring what we find in the world. We should also, when needed, filter out structures that are harmful or exclusionary. We should create spaces that ask the same of everyone and that use the generativity of everyone’s responses to create web products that emerge out of more diverse voices.

      </h2>
    <time class="js-datetime" datetime="2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z">2022-01-10T01:49:54.496Z</time>
    <p class="article__summary">I’m willing to bet that you probably didn’t start your web career because you wanted to be a politician or a salesperson. But here’s the cold, hard truth, friend: if you want to work on design systems, you don’t have a choice. Someone has to pay for your time, and that means someone has to sell what you do to an audience that speaks value in an entirely different language. 



It’s not exactly easy to connect the benefits of a design system directly to revenue. With an ecomm site, you can add a feature and measure the impact. With other conversion-based digital experiences, if your work is good, your customers will convert more. But because a design system is (usually) an internal tool, it’s just harder to connect those dots. 



This article boils down the methods I’ve put into practice convincing executives not just to fund the initial push of design system work, but to keep funding it. I’ll share how I’ve adjusted the language I use to describe common design system benefits, allowing me to more clearly communicate with decision makers.



Know your audience



In my experience, design systems can be owned by information technology teams, marketing and communications departments, or (best case scenario) cross-disciplinary teams that bring many specialists together. The first thing you need to do is determine where the system lives, as in which department owns and cares for it. 



If it’s part of IT, for example, you need to think like a CIO or an IT Director and speak to their objectives and values. These leaders are typically more internally focused; they’ll filter the value of the design system in terms of the employees of the company. In contrast, if the system belongs to Marketing, put on your CMO or Marketing Director hat. Marketing teams are often externally focused; they think in terms of B2B audiences and end users. 



The way organizations structure the ownership of a design system can be more complex, but let’s use these two paths (internal vs external) as frameworks for building a persuasive case for those owners.



Internal-orientation motivators



Based on the research we’ve done since 2018, there are three very specific internal motivators for having a design system:



EfficiencyOnboardingScale.



Efficiency benefit



Design systems allow for the rapid prototyping of new ideas using existing, production-ready components. They allow teams to reuse design and code, and they allow individuals to focus their creative energy on new problems instead of wasting it on old ones. Executives and decision-makers may abstractly understand all that, but you need to be able to tell them what it will take to realize the efficiency benefit. 



There’s a theoretical maximum to how productive a team can be. When you talk about a design system creating more efficiency in your processes, you’re really talking about raising the ceiling on that max. As happens with so many things in life, though, that comes with a trade-off. Early on, while a team is actually building the system, they won’t be as productive on the rest of their work.



The efficiency curve looks like this:



Figure 1. With Productivity on the y-axis and Time on the x-axis, the Design System Efficiency Curve dips down at the start as the team ramps up on the system, but eventually surpasses standard productivity once the system is in place.



If you’re talking to an executive, it’s important to acknowledge this dip in productivity. 



Spend some time working out these specific calculations for your organization. For example, you might need four team members for three months to reach a point where the system will save everyone on the team approximately two hours per week. You’re candidly acknowledging the necessary investment while demonstrating the eventual benefits. And make sure to mention that the productivity benefits will continue indefinitely! The math will almost always end up on your side. 



Another critical point to raise is that simply having a design system has a cumulative effect on the efficiency of your teams. Since the system is an internal tool that can be used 1) across multiple products or experiences, 2) by many teams throughout the organization, and 3) in many phases of the product design and development process, you are gaining efficiencies on many levels. 



The team working on in-store kiosks can build their interface with a well-tested set of components. Your UX people can use the system to prototype and test with production-ready code. The people responsible for grooming the backlog know there is a stable pattern library upon which they are building new features or fixing old ones. Anyone looking for answers to what, why, or how your organization designs and builds products will find those answers in the living system.



The efficiency at each of these (and many other) decision points is how we can raise the ceiling on our total possible efficiency. How this plays out is very different in each organization. I’m here to tell you that part of the work is thinking about how a design system will impact every part of your process—not just design or development.



What to measure



Action: Measure the cost of productivity with and without a design system.



If you aren’t already, start measuring how productive your team is now. The easiest way to do this is to break your team’s work down into measurable cycles. Once you have a rough idea of how much you can get done in a cycle of work, you’ll be able to compare your efficiency before the system was in place with your efficiency after. This kind of measurable benefit will speak volumes to your executive team.



Onboarding benefits



Growth is expensive. When you hire a new team member, you don’t just supply a salary and benefits. You need a computer, a desk, a chair, accounts to all the software/services…the list goes on. And all these expenses hit before your new employee is a fully contributing member of the team. You won’t start to recoup your investment for a few months, at least. 



Design systems can reduce the time it takes your new hire to become a productive contributor. Once you have a healthy design system in place, you’re able to provide an employee with a clearly-defined and effective toolset that is well-documented and can be applied across multiple initiatives. More specifically, assigning new hires to start out working on the design system team will allow them to quickly learn how your organization designs and builds digital products.



Figure 2. A Model for Onboarding. As you bring people into your organization from your hiring pool, consider having them start on your design system team and then rotate out onto other teams. As you grow, folks who haven’t had a turn on the system team can rotate in as well.



On the left in Fig. 2, you have a pool of potential employees. As you hire individuals, you can bring them into the design system team, where they’ll gain a deep understanding of how your organization builds digital products. Once they’re up to speed, you can seamlessly move them to another product, discipline, or feature-based team where they’ll take this knowledge and hit the ground running. Additionally, your organization can benefit from having all team members (even those who have been around for a while) periodically work a rotation with the design system team. This continuously spreads the design system expertise around the organization and makes it part of the fabric of how you work.



And don’t think this approach is only valuable for designers or developers. A healthy design system team comprises people from many disciplines. In addition to team member rotation, building in time to mentor folks from many different disciplines can prove tremendously valuable in the long run. A highly functional design system team can serve as an ideal model of workflow and can educate many team members dispersed throughout the organization about how to approach their work.



Believe me, executives’ eyes will light up when you share how a design system can ensure high productivity in record time. As a caution, though, rotating people in and out of any team too often can leave them feeling exhausted and can make it hard for them to be productive. Remember, you have the flexibility to scale this to a level that makes sense for your team. Be smart and use this approach as it works in your context.



What to measure



Action: Measure the time it takes for teams to become productive.



As new people are added, a team typically returns to the “forming” stage of Tuckman’s stages of group development. This is part of the reason that growth is expensive. But with a design system in place and a healthy culture, you can reduce the time it takes the team to get back to “performing.”



Scale benefits



Traditionally, you have to hire more people to scale productivity. A design system enables a team to accomplish more with less. Reusability is a major reason teams choose to work in a more systematic way. Small teams with an effective system can design, build, and maintain hundreds of sites each year. They’d never come close without a design system to work with. 



UX Pin has a design system guide that starts by acknowledging something that most of us ignore.



Scaling design through hiring, without putting standards in place, is a myth. With every new hire, new ideas for color palettes, typography and patterns appear in the product, growing the inconsistency and increasing the maintenance cost. Every new hire increases the design entropy.



A well-executed system allows a team to scale while keeping design entropy at bay.



What to measure



Action: Compare the amount of people on your team to the amount of work they are accomplishing.



Adding people to a team doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll get more work done faster. This is well-documented in historical software books like Fred Brooks’ The Mythical Man-Month. Eventually, you will have to investigate changing other factors (besides just adding more people) to increase productivity. A good design system can be one of these factors that increases the productivity of the team members you already have. It’s this change in productivity over scale that you need to measure and compare in order to prove value for this benefit.



External-orientation motivators



Let’s shift to thinking about the benefits that a design system offers to end-users. The four primary external motivators are:



ConsistencyTrustAccessibilityUsability.



Consistency and Trust benefits



Consistency is widely assumed to be the primary benefit of a design system. We identify dozens of button designs, color variations, and inconsistent typefaces in hopes of convincing higher-ups to allow us to build a system to bring it all in line. After working on design systems for the last five or six years, I can say with confidence that a design system will not make your product more consistent. 



You see, us web designers and developers are very scrappy. We can create the most inconsistent experiences within even the most rigid systems. It’s not the system itself that creates consistency, it’s the culture of an organization. It’s all of the unspoken expectations—the filters through which we make decisions—that give us the confidence to pause and ask if the work we’re doing fits culturally with the product we’re building. A good CMO knows this, and they won’t buy the oversimplified idea that a design system will solve the rampant inconsistencies in our work. 



Because of this, these executives often have a different (and easier to measure) question: “Does it convert?” This perspective and line of conversation is not an ideal approach. Believe me, we can create experiences that convert but are not good for our users or our brands. Given this, a conversation with your CMO might go better if you shift the language to talk about trust instead.



With inconsistent experiences, your users subconsciously lose trust in your brand. They’ve been conditioned to expect a certain kind of user experience, and that’s what they should be given, even across multiple websites or products. Vanessa Mitchell wrote about why brand trust is more vital to survival now than it’s ever been:



“Brand trust as an ‘“insurance policy”’ against future issues is not a new concept. Most organizations know trust bestowed by the consumer can not only make or break a business, it can also ensure you survive a problem in the future. But few achieve brand trust adequately, preferring to pay lip service rather than delve into what it really means: Authentically caring about customers and their needs.”



When your customer is using your product to accomplish a very specific task, that one task is the only thing that matters to them. Creating a consistent experience that works for everyone and allows them to accomplish their goals is building trust. CMOs need to understand how design systems empower trusted relationships so those relationships contribute to your bottom line.



What to measure



Action: Measure the engagement of your customers.



Customer engagement can be measured with web analytics platforms. What you’re looking for will vary depending on the context for your organization, but trends in things like time on site, visit frequency, subscription rates, and bounce rates will give you meaningful data to work with. It’s also very common to track customer engagement with metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) by asking simple questions of customers repeatedly over time. There are so many ways to structure tests of the usability of your work, so I’d encourage you to loop in the UX team to help you find tests that will demonstrate the user engagement success of the design system effort.



Accessibility benefits



Accessibility can be a tremendous benefit of a design system. Do the work properly the first time, then allow that beautifully accessible component to serve your customers each time it is used. Certainly, it’s not a fail-safe measure—there is still integration-level testing to ensure component accessibility translates to the larger experience—but ensuring the accessibility of individual components will result in more accessible experiences. And integrating good accessibility practices into your system means more folks within your organization are aligned with this important work. 



You might find at first that marketers aren’t all that interested in accessibility, but they should be. Did you know that there were 814 web accessibility related lawsuits (just in the US!) in 2017? Did you know that there were almost 2,300 in 2018? That’s a 181% increase. This must be a priority. First, because it’s the right thing to do. Second, because it’s important to the sustainability of the business. A design system can help you address this issue, and it can help you maintain compliance as you grow. This is the kind of message that resonates with leadership.



What to Measure



Action: Measure your compliance to accessibility guidelines over time.



Many organizations have a regular cadence of accessibility audits across their digital properties. While some of this can be automated, there’s always a manual aspect needed to truly evaluate the accessibility of a site or application. Tracking how often regressions occur in the properties served by your design system can be a great way to demonstrate the value that system is bringing to the organization.



Usability benefits



As with so many aspects of a design system, usability benefits come from repetition. Design system pros often hope to focus energy on solving a usability challenge only once before moving on to the next problem. This absolutely is a benefit of a well-constructed system. It’s also very true that “familiarity breeds usability.” Your customers will learn to use your products and begin to subconsciously rely on that familiarity with the experience to lower their cognitive load. This should be just as important to our executive leadership as it is to those of us who are practitioners. 



You can also reframe this benefit in the context of conversion. Helping our users accomplish their goals is helping them convert. They are there to use your product. So make it easy to do, and they’ll do it more. This is what businesses need and what executives want to see—improving the business by helping customers. As mentioned above, we want to make sure we’re doing this in healthy ways for both our users and our brands.



What to Measure



Action: This might be the easiest one—measure conversion!



Running usability studies will help to validate and measure the success of your work with the system, which many organizations are already doing. Your goal should be to validate that components are usable, which will allow you to build a culture of user-centered design. Setting the bar for what it takes to evolve the system—such as requiring that changes are tested with real users—introduces this idea into the core of all your processes, where it should be.



Sell investment, not cost



Knowing how and which internal and external motivators to touch on during conversations is significant, but there’s one last thing I’d like to mention, and it has to do with your way of thinking. A major factor in many of these conversations lies simply in how we frame things: move the conversation about the cost of building a design system into a conversation about the present and residual benefits of the investment you’re making. It’s easy to view the time and effort required to build a system as an investment in ultimately delivering high-quality digital products. But leadership will be more willing to consider realistic budgets and timelines if you talk about it like a long-term investment that has benefits on multiple levels throughout the business. This also leaves you with the ability to regularly remind them that this product will never be done—it will require ongoing funding and support.



A design system project will not succeed if you don’t convince others that it’s the right thing to do. Successful, sustainable design systems start with the people, so you have to begin by building consensus. Building a design system means you’re asking everyone to change how they work—everyone has to be on board.



This concept of collaboration is so core to the work of design systems that it led all of us here at Sparkbox to look for opportunities to better understand how teams around the world are designing, building, and using a more systematic approach to digital product design. For the last three years, we’ve been gathering and sharing data in the form of the Design Systems Survey and the Design System Calendar. If you are considering a design system for your organization, or if you work with a design system team, the survey and calendar may be helpful in your quest to build better products.
