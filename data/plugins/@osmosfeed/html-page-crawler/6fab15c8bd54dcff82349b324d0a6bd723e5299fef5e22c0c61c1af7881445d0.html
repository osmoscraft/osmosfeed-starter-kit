  Hi there! As you are analysing source code, I assume that you are a technically interested and 
  creative person. What brought you here is beyond me - as this is no masterpiece. But I am happy 
  you are here and I want you to never stop exploring. I want you to keep that spark and to pass
  it on. Let nobody ever tell you that technology is magic and a company or government should 
  control it. We, the interested, should be the ones getting the information and tools we need.
  And we, the tweakers, the hackers, the people poking holes into things should be the ones to 
  educate the next to come and replace us. Share, teach, introduce, help, mentor. Use that brain
  to make this place better. I like you - go ahead and have a look.

	<p>A few days ago I was on vacation in a place that had terrible mobile connectivity and whilst it provided WiFi, nothing worked. I even brought my own cables and travel router, but to no avail. This was not only a good opportunity for some &#8220;digital detox&#8221;, but it also showed me once again that the web isn&#8217;t as resilient as we want it to be.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s what happened: one evening we went to the hotel lounge to play some games. They had a library with some, but the one thing that was missing was a dice.</p>

	<p>Not to worry, I thought, and went to look on my mobile phone to get a quick dice solution on the web. There are a lot out there, but here&#8217;s the kicker: I couldn&#8217;t find any that loaded quickly and subsequently worked offline. None. At. All. Any web search for &#8220;offline dice&#8221; resulted in tons of apps advertised to me. Other online solutions are riddled with ads and have a first load of several megabytes. Interestingly enough, searching on Desktop has better solutions &#8211; the place were you are less likely to need a simple solution that works offline. There is also a huge difference between search engines.</p>

	<p>Even those that are excellent in their randomness like the one on <a href="https://www.random.org/dice/" title="">random.org</a> do a reload of the whole page on every &#8220;throw&#8221; of the dice. Others implemented the sides of the dice as images and didn&#8217;t preload them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Simulating a dice throw&#8221; is an example of every programming language tutorial I&#8217;ve ever seen. I remember learning <span class="caps">BASIC</span> and Pascal and these were parts of it. I&#8217;ve also seen this come up in job interviews back in the day. Offline functionality is also not that hard to do. A simple single-purpose web product like a dice simulator should be not hard to release. It seems the lure of selling it on an app store or making money with it by surrounding it with ads is a bigger incentive though.</p>

	<p>The solution was to go back to the hotel room, get my laptop and write a JavaScript solution in a local file whilst my partner went out for a cigarette break. <a href="https://codepo8.github.io/dice-throw-simulator/dice.html" title="">I am not proud of the code</a>, but I also had a few drinks before &#8211; and it did the job.</p>

	<p>It made me think though. Despite dozens of tutorials, books, presentations and videos, considering offline and bad connectivity is still not ingrained into our thinking as developers.</p>

	<p>When <span class="caps">HTML5</span> became a thing and the web went mobile first, offline availability was a main need to match native apps. Earlier approaches like <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/" title="">AppCache</a> had a lot of issues which is why we came up with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" title="">ServiceWorker</a>. ServiceWorker went through a lot of iterations, and as it was designed to cater to a myriad of use cases, it became complex. Many people use abstraction libraries like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/" title="">Workbox</a> instead.</p>

	<p>And, I am to blame, too. Last year <a href="https://christianheilmann.com/2020/10/19/getting-dicey-dice-throw-simulator/" title="">I released a dice emulator for fun</a> and the thing I didn&#8217;t do is to make it work offline. Although it was a single <span class="caps">HTML</span> document. Now I added that functionality. So if you go to it now, it loads quickly even on a horrible connection and will subsequently work offline. You can also install it as an app.</p>

	<p><a href="https://codepo8.github.io/dice-throw-simulator/"><img src="https://christianheilmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dice-1.gif" alt="A dice throw simulator in the browser." width="100%"/></a></p>

	<p>I will write up in detail how to do that, but <a href="https://github.com/codepo8/dice-throw-simulator/" title="">the source code</a> should give most of the clues. The biggest obstacle was to make it work with GitHub pages rather than a bespoke domain (which I may add later).</p>

	<p>To me, this taught me to be more concerned about edge cases of our users. I want the web to be there for people when they need it. And if the functionality they need is a random number between 1 and 6 they shouldn&#8217;t have to download an app for that. So let&#8217;s embrace a flaky web in everything we do.</p>
