Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts. Things aren’t normal since two years now and I the only way I currently see is people finding an arrangement with their inner self to deal with this. Which isn’t really a solution, more a compromise. I wish you all out there a lot of strength, passion, empathy and enough energy to find your own path and solution, to build your own opinion on things. If you’re directly affected of the war situation, I send you all the best wishes and my hope is for a peaceful together in near future again. At home, we have new neighbours since two weeks — a mother with her child. We try our best to keep them in a normal life, playing and talking with them while the husband/father is in danger and far away from them.\nweb intro\nSpeaking about the web we have much nicer topics to talk about, such as new iOS/Safari 15.4 with image lazy loading, Chrome and Firefox version 100, new Roboto Serif font and how to get better at achieving your goals. But if we don’t and make an exception, even then we have a cooler option than being annoyed about ourselves and instead accept the situation. And finally I’ve been surprised this morning to read that CSS-Tricks, one of my all time favorite sites is now part of Digital Ocean and I had to give Chris who built this site a public shoutout and thank you for all what he’s done so far for the web dev community.\nNews\n\n\tBoth Chrome and Firefox will soon reach version 100. First congrats for that. But if you rely on user agent sniffing better check your code as it may break with the first three-digit version out there.\n\tiOS 15.4 has finally added icon support in the manifest, Web Push, AR, and VR experiments, being a big improvement for web apps on Apple devices. Here’s what’s new in Safari 15.4, including the <dialog> element :has() selector, Cascade Layers, new viewport units, CSP Level 3 and more.\n\tWith Safari 15.4 we’ll get accent-color everywhere and so we can style our form inputs in a nice way cross-browser.\n\tThere is a new design for one of the best – or maybe the best – websites on frontend developer resources. Make sure to check out the MDN Web Docs.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tPHP: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for modern coding standards in PHP, trying to fight all the outdated and partially wrong solutions found on the web.\n\tWhen creating REST APIs we can make so many mistakes. Therefore it is a good idea to learn some basics. Ronald Blüthl provides a good starting point to learn about REST API design.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tYou know the Roboto font family? Here’s great news: In addition to the sans-serif there’s now the serif variant of the font family and it’s pretty cool.\n\tA well-written headline, a perfectly descriptive label, or the accurate text on a button makes all the difference. Andy Hertzfeld wrote a fun little story about choosing proper text in a user interface.\n\nTooling\n\n\tThere are good reasons (e. g. security and maintainability) to keep your programming languages, operating systems, frameworks, or libraries up to date. We can check the end-of-life dates of software on a new well-documented website.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tWhat is the environmental impact of visiting a website and what part do advertising, and analytics, play? It may be up to 70%. Here’s this interesting research saying using ad blockers could save a lot of CO2.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tRupert McKay shares common ways to do sorting in JavaScript.\n\tHere’s the guide to upgrade your apps to React v18 which is soon going to be released.\n\nCSS\n\n\tDid you know you can set up wrapper width with min() and margin-inline much cleaner these days than we’re used to?

For new software developers, it is helpful that experienced people share their learnings. Ivan Stoev teaches us seven lessons he has learned as a software engineer.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tAdam has some nice ideas on how to manage your personal goal setting with a tiny “framework”.\n\tOn the topic of personal goal setting I found this interesting thesis that you should »never set a goal that a dead person can do better than you«. It’s about setting realistic goals that we can really achieve, not like “stop eating chocolate” which is unrealistic in so many points.\n\tSo we’ve learned that we shouldn’t just buy things and we should aim for minimalism in our lives.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nfrom time to time my intro isn’t entirely web-focused. I always struggle a bit when this is the case because usually it’s about sensitive topics which aren’t easy to discuss in public but this is a personal newsletter. And you can always skip the next paragraph. \npersonal intro\nWhen I sent out the last edition, we were in a pandemic. Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts. Things aren’t normal since two years now and I the only way I currently see is people finding an arrangement with their inner self to deal with this. Which isn’t really a solution, more a compromise. I wish you all out there a lot of strength, passion, empathy and enough energy to find your own path and solution, to build your own opinion on things. If you’re directly affected of the war situation, I send you all the best wishes and my hope is for a peaceful together in near future again. At home, we have new neighbours since two weeks — a mother with her child. We try our best to keep them in a normal life, playing and talking with them while the husband/father is in danger and far away from them.\nweb intro\nSpeaking about the web we have much nicer topics to talk about, such as new iOS/Safari 15.4 with image lazy loading, Chrome and Firefox version 100, new Roboto Serif font and how to get better at achieving your goals. But if we don’t and make an exception, even then we have a cooler option than being annoyed about ourselves and instead accept the situation. And finally I’ve been surprised this morning to read that CSS-Tricks, one of my all time favorite sites is now part of Digital Ocean and I had to give Chris who built this site a public shoutout and thank you for all what he’s done so far for the web dev community.\nNews\n\n\tBoth Chrome and Firefox will soon reach version 100. First congrats for that. But if you rely on user agent sniffing better check your code as it may break with the first three-digit version out there.\n\tiOS 15.4 has finally added icon support in the manifest, Web Push, AR, and VR experiments, being a big improvement for web apps on Apple devices. Here’s what’s new in Safari 15.4, including the <dialog> element :has() selector, Cascade Layers, new viewport units, CSP Level 3 and more.\n\tWith Safari 15.4 we’ll get accent-color everywhere and so we can style our form inputs in a nice way cross-browser.\n\tThere is a new design for one of the best – or maybe the best – websites on frontend developer resources. Make sure to check out the MDN Web Docs.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tPHP: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for modern coding standards in PHP, trying to fight all the outdated and partially wrong solutions found on the web.\n\tWhen creating REST APIs we can make so many mistakes. Therefore it is a good idea to learn some basics. Ronald Blüthl provides a good starting point to learn about REST API design.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tYou know the Roboto font family? Here’s great news: In addition to the sans-serif there’s now the serif variant of the font family and it’s pretty cool.\n\tA well-written headline, a perfectly descriptive label, or the accurate text on a button makes all the difference. Andy Hertzfeld wrote a fun little story about choosing proper text in a user interface.\n\nTooling\n\n\tThere are good reasons (e. g. security and maintainability) to keep your programming languages, operating systems, frameworks, or libraries up to date. We can check the end-of-life dates of software on a new well-documented website.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tWhat is the environmental impact of visiting a website and what part do advertising, and analytics, play? It may be up to 70%. Here’s this interesting research saying using ad blockers could save a lot of CO2.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tRupert McKay shares common ways to do sorting in JavaScript.\n\tHere’s the guide to upgrade your apps to React v18 which is soon going to be released.\n\nCSS\n\n\tDid you know you can set up wrapper width with min() and margin-inline much cleaner these days than we’re used to? See the link for the code example.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThe software development industry is growing and growing. For new software developers, it is helpful that experienced people share their learnings. Ivan Stoev teaches us seven lessons he has learned as a software engineer.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tAdam has some nice ideas on how to manage your personal goal setting with a tiny “framework”.\n\tOn the topic of personal goal setting I found this interesting thesis that you should »never set a goal that a dead person can do better than you«. It’s about setting realistic goals that we can really achieve, not like “stop eating chocolate” which is unrealistic in so many points.\n\tSo we’ve learned that we shouldn’t just buy things and we should aim for minimalism in our lives. But well, what if we still bought something in an impulse? Stop being annoyed with yourself and make the best out of it: Use the thing now that you have it and enjoy it.\n\n\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute here. Thank you!Anselm",

You’re keeping this project alive and make it a usually joyful thing to send out a new edition.\nTo close the intro and dive into the articles, I want to share this mini documentary about my work-life in which I share how I combine web development and market gardening today as well as how to protect yourself from burn-out situations:  \n\nNews\n\n\tThis month a lot changed from a legal perspective for website owners: Two court rulings now decided that both using Google Webfonts as well as Google Analytics isn’t a legitimate interest and therefore can’t be active by default. You may still use these services if you ask for permission via Cookie Banner explicitly but it fails to serve the reason to use these services. Webfonts shouldn’t be replaced only by user action and analytics that are only collecting a small portion of user data are barely useful. So in future, self-host webfonts (from a performance perspective it’s also not worse than using the service), and use an analytics provider that’s matching GDPR rules.\n\tWhat’s new in PHP in 2022? A lot, according to this article by Brent from Stitcher.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tAlan Dávalos writes about the new baseline for web development in 2022: Now that Internet Explorer seems to die really in June this year, so now we should focus on low-spec Android devices, older Safari versions or slow networks.\n\tI’m a big fan of the paradigm “choose based on the current needs”, so when I had to prototype a recent client project on a tight budget, I made a choice that I found risky but was the best for this project: Using TailwindCSS.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tDigital products increasingly often depend on design systems. How can we evolve those design systems without breaking the products themselves? Brad Frost lays out the pros and cons about whether version the whole library or individual components.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tSimon Hearne looks at some key cache scenarios and recommend the ideal headers to set. Understanding caching is still one of the harder parts of the web and often disregarded.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tMadza shares a couple of lesser known HTML attributes that nevertheless are very helpful and may reduce JavaScript overhead.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tWe should keep learning about accessibility and make it one of our top priorities. Melanie Sumner writes about why accessibility is still seen as a side issue and how we can change it.\n\tDo you know about the CSS pseudo-class :focus-visible? Pawel Grzybek explains the difference between :focus-visible and :focus.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tChris Ferdinandi shares an easier way to write if … or checks with vanilla JavaScript by using Array.includes() when we need to check multiple conditions.\n\tZach Leatherman shares a Web Component that enhances <details> elements with very useful behaviour that I also need nearly all the time using these HTML elements. For example keyboard actions, default closed on mobile but opened on big screens.\n\nCSS\n\n\tThis is a nice collection of Tailwind CSS components to use for free. But even if you don’t use Tailwind it’s a nice inspiration for building components.\n\tOne thing that often gets neglected when discussing about Tailwind’s utility class approach is that it isn’t limited to that. You can use Tailwind’s directives and functions to make use of Tailwind’s presets inside your own CSS. That could go as far as writing completely your own class references and only using the styling inside your CSS file.\n\tWonder what fit-content is suitable for?

Dan Mall reflects on the business of his design systems agency in 2021.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nIt is January February already, and it feels like time flies. In the world of technology, there are always so many news, trends, and possible distractions. On top of that, we already have so much work to do, projects to finish, and people to please. It is easy to feel empty or get burned out. Plus, we still live in the middle of an uncomfortable situation for everyone, a so far unseen pandemic situation; This causes a lot of mental problems on its own and drains a lot of energy from us.\nWhat we can do in this case — although it’s hard to accept — is slowing down.\nWhen I feel overwhelmed, I try to go outside as much as possible. I will get some fresh air, have a long walk and reflect on the things I do. I try to answer the question: »What brings me joy in web development?«. After that, I find myself working more calmly and happily.\nNow, if you have the time and energy, you can read through some interesting articles we curated for you. This week, Malte wrote the intro.\nGeneric\n\n\tCory Doctorow by the EFF shares some of the issues of today’s web and how that may change over the next years as both U.S. and the EU initialized law proposals for better interoperability of services and software. There’s quite some interesting stuff in the article.\n\tArnold Galovics shares his first-hand experiences with microservices. He offers some strong arguments on why microservices might not be a good fit for your next project.\n\tDoeke Norg shares how to use PHP generators instead of iterating through arrays with traditional methods. Same approach works in JavaScript as well.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tJosh W. Cameau blogged about his custom CSS reset which includes a nice idea of more variable, better line-height via calc()\n\tOliver Schöndorfer in the ideal line length and line heigh in web design. He shares examples of what doesn’t work and how to improve legibility of a website with some easy and generic rules.\n\tIcones.js is a huge collection of iconsets with a preview.\n\nTooling\n\n\tesbuild is a new JavaScript compiler that’s super fast and could shake up the current tooling world.\n\tParcelCSS is a super fast parser, transpiler, and minified for CSS. It’s so fast because it’s not a node.js tool but written in Rust.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tThis is something I love to see coming to our browsers: The HTML Sanitizer API. If that becomes reality, we finally get a safer frontend web and our written JavaScript code is slimmer and less bloated up with sanitising libraries. Until then (and maybe afterwards as we still need it for some cases), we can use DOMPurify.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tIt’s not been long ago that we’ve seen HTTP/2 making a huge impact to website performance. Now HTTP/3 is here and brings another set of performance benefits.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tDid you know you can control autocapitalization in user input with the autocapitalize property?\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tStephanie Eckles has a short code snippet how to standardise focus styles on a web project easily with CSS custom properties.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tThis cool JavaScript snippet offers \"add event to calendar\" buttons for websites.\n\tStephanie Eckles explains how to use the Intersection Observer Web API as a performant way to track where elements are in the viewport and other scrollable regions.\n\tWhat’s the state of ES6 native modules in our browsers? Right now, it’s still a bit complicated but things get better and once a few more things land in browsers, we may finally reduce the complexity of frontend code and workspaces again.\n\nCSS\n\n\tBramus Van Damme shares what’s to expect in 2022 from CSS — which could be a lot. Things like Container Queries, Cascade Layers, Color functions, better viewport units, Parent (:has()) selector, Subgrid, Accent color, Media Query ranges.\n\tTemani Afif shares an approach how to build reponsive layouts with less media queries based on the way we note Flex and Grid patterns. By using min, max, clamp or autofit functions, we reduce the complexity of media queries.\n\tThe CSS :has() selector is way more than a “Parent Selector”.\n\tThis CSS snippet collection by 30 seconds of code contains great utilities and interactive CSS modules, such as custom checkbox styling, scroll snap, and lots more.\n\tStefan Judis explains how the hwb() color syntax works and why it’s probably the easiest to work and understand as human. Safari and Firefox both recently implemented it with others to follow soon hopefully.\n\tCSS has come a long way since the early days of web development, when tables and various other hacks were used for layout and positioning. Today's developers can enjoy writing CSS that works in all major browsers, without having to bend over backwards to implement tricky layout requirements. Not only does this make it easier to create dynamic layouts, but it also allows you to ship smaller (and simpler) stylesheets by removing unnecessary cruft. In this article, we'll look at various scenarios where modern techniques can reduce the complexity of your code and allow you to write better CSS.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\t\n I was busy and productive, which made me feel important and accomplished.

I want to say thank you to everyone here who reads or supports this project.\nThis year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time. But nature has helped me, my child has helped me, meditation and focusing on my own opinion, on my own body, on my own health helps me staying sane. A big reveal was during my Covid infection: Once I realised how “pre-informed” I was about the disease, I stripped out this bias and listened to my body instead, my health improved next day and recovery was very quick from then on while it stalled over some days before. I share this because I think it’s very important to listen to yourself, to keep track on your own health instead of being drawn down by everyday TV shows that don’t even offer any solution but only share how bad everything is.\nMy wish for the future is to empower you to be your own you. You already have the ability, now to find out how to enable it. It may not be the easiest but probably worth it.\nThere’s a new year coming and I’d love to see that more people will trust their own mind and body again and work towards this goal. Read you next year!\nNews\n\n\tDo you like or do you not like Tailwind CSS? No matter which camp we are in, we should give love and respect to Adam and the team.

Jeremy Keith points out why he thinks tracking users is wrong.\n\tSome small tips to make it easy for newcomers to join your team and participate in your codebase.\n\tDavid Heinemeier Hansson is known for his absolute statements. This time he writes about not celebrating incompetence. We are competent professionals, and we should act like it.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tThere is so much to learn about writing and formatting text. Also, there is so much to achieve by using just words and HTML. Slava Shestopalov teaches us all about setting better links for websites and emails.\n\tFloating UI is a small and modern library that offers you elements floating to another element (e.g. tooltips).\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMartin Underhill shows us a real-world example of the difficulties between user experience, technical complexity, and valid ARIA.\n\nCSS\n\n\tOpen Props is a set of open source CSS Custom Properties that are providing a consistent set of defaults working with dark and light and various other theme options.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tI know this comes too late for Christmas but it doesn’t come too late to put these tips into action. Giving gifts that matter shares some nice examples of gifting your beloved ones with something that really comes from your heart and isn’t just something that we buy to have a gift because we’re used to this habit.\n\tHow to feel gratitude as perfectionist is important to so many people and helped me better understand why it’s so hard for me to accept things, to feel real gratitude in so many situations. But training helps a lot once you try to understand and change this.\n\tA heart of Mercy describes how we can transform other people’s lives and our own by being open-minded and trying to understand other people even if we disagree, by showing and telling mercy and empathy.\n\t\nWe're blasted with views from others everywhere we look. It seems everyone has an opinion on how best we should conduct our lives, spend our money, and other things.\n\nDr. Egypt Iredia gives some great tips on how we can reduce opinion overload.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute to financing the project.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nevery year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. I want to say thank you to everyone here who reads or supports this project.\nThis year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time. But nature has helped me, my child has helped me, meditation and focusing on my own opinion, on my own body, on my own health helps me staying sane. A big reveal was during my Covid infection: Once I realised how “pre-informed” I was about the disease, I stripped out this bias and listened to my body instead, my health improved next day and recovery was very quick from then on while it stalled over some days before. I share this because I think it’s very important to listen to yourself, to keep track on your own health instead of being drawn down by everyday TV shows that don’t even offer any solution but only share how bad everything is.\nMy wish for the future is to empower you to be your own you. You already have the ability, now to find out how to enable it. It may not be the easiest but probably worth it.\nThere’s a new year coming and I’d love to see that more people will trust their own mind and body again and work towards this goal. Read you next year!\nNews\n\n\tDo you like or do you not like Tailwind CSS? No matter which camp we are in, we should give love and respect to Adam and the team. The output, communication, and quality are impressive. Tailwind CSS v3.0 was released.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tIt feels like there is an unstoppable unhealthy business around web analytics. Jeremy Keith points out why he thinks tracking users is wrong.\n\tSome small tips to make it easy for newcomers to join your team and participate in your codebase.\n\tDavid Heinemeier Hansson is known for his absolute statements. This time he writes about not celebrating incompetence. We are competent professionals, and we should act like it.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tThere is so much to learn about writing and formatting text. Also, there is so much to achieve by using just words and HTML. Slava Shestopalov teaches us all about setting better links for websites and emails.\n\tFloating UI is a small and modern library that offers you elements floating to another element (e.g. tooltips).\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMartin Underhill shows us a real-world example of the difficulties between user experience, technical complexity, and valid ARIA.\n\nCSS\n\n\tOpen Props is a set of open source CSS Custom Properties that are providing a consistent set of defaults working with dark and light and various other theme options.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tI know this comes too late for Christmas but it doesn’t come too late to put these tips into action. Giving gifts that matter shares some nice examples of gifting your beloved ones with something that really comes from your heart and isn’t just something that we buy to have a gift because we’re used to this habit.\n\tHow to feel gratitude as perfectionist is important to so many people and helped me better understand why it’s so hard for me to accept things, to feel real gratitude in so many situations. But training helps a lot once you try to understand and change this.\n\tA heart of Mercy describes how we can transform other people’s lives and our own by being open-minded and trying to understand other people even if we disagree, by showing and telling mercy and empathy.\n\t\nWe're blasted with views from others everywhere we look. It seems everyone has an opinion on how best we should conduct our lives, spend our money, and other things.\n\nDr. Egypt Iredia gives some great tips on how we can reduce opinion overload.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you like this newsletter, you can contribute to financing the project.

So let us treat them with respect and be friendly. On November 15th, there was an amazing Safari release. Safari Tech Preview now has lazy image loading, accent-color for browser UI controls enabled by default and supports dynamic viewport units, flex-basis: content, and rel=\"noopener/noreferrer\" for form elements. Pretty cool for just one preview release, isn’t it?\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tIvaylo Gerchev shares the Vue 3 Composition API and its advantages over previous methods. If you’re using Vue, this is a cool intro and comparison what to use for which solution.\n\tUntil near future, we need to reverse an array to find values or its index in an JavaScript array which causes an array mutation and is a memory-increasing action. Luckily, there's an ECMAscript proposal for findLast and findLastIndex.\n\tRematch.js is using the best practices from Redux but without the boilerplate and it’s super tiny (2kb).

Usable with React, Vue, Angular or others.\n\nCSS\n\n\tA sticky footer solution by Sílvio Rosa that only needs two lines of CSS. Sticky footer means the element is on the bottom of the page even if not enough content is there while not being in fixed position on the site as well.\n\tAhmad Shadeed often writes about little findings in CSS that are super useful. Such as this one where he explains why position: sticky does not work automatically with CSS Grid and how to use them in combination.\n\tIt looks like there is finally a way to animate a dynamic height using only CSS. Nelson Menezes shows us how he achieved this in a funny and interesting read.\n\tThis is a very interesting case of why it’s best to avoid !important: While you can use !important in CSS Custom Properties, it doesn’t work as we’re used to. Instead, it’s stripped from the definition by the parser but influences the CSS cascade. See the article to understand this better.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tHabits and streaks are cool but what happens usually when we miss a day and break our streak? We tend to let the habit fall completely. When things aren’t going according to plan, Practicing with Zero is simply pausing, and deciding how we want to proceed from here.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nthanks for all the feedback that reached me last time, it was awesome to read that so many people support me even when my schedule of writing isn’t regular. Now that I had a thought on how to continue with WDRL I realised that this project won’t be sold, won’t be transferred to someone else or such thing. It’s just too personal to do this. But Malte Riechmann will help me collect and write some links from this edition on — it’s all in the early stages but I’m glad because it will help me and save me time.\nIn the past two weeks I had the chance to think about a lot of things that are influencing our lives at the moment. It made me realise that it’s upon us how we see our worlds, how we see the problems of our world. It’s our choice how we deal with other people, whether we confront people, cut them short, or whether we’re calm, interested and open minded. I know the latter is not possible all the time, but trying is really worth it. If we understand each other better, we create emotions, we can hold together, we will get stronger and happier. We can support each other in unstable situations, when we’re not sure what to do or what to believe. It’s the community that works for humans, and it’s hate and envy that boosts the bad things in life.

No images, no weird absolute positioning or similar.\n\tWith plain CSS we can now achieve sticky section indicators in definition lists.

The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.\nSecurity\n\n\tJake Archibald teaches us how we win at CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This is great because it’s one of the trickier things to test, debug and grasp CORS as a developer.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tChristian Kozalla shows the proper approach to implement and style a dialog element to show a dialog/overlay/modal to a user.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tEric Eggert explains the differences between buttons and links and why we shouldn’t just use what we want to for our web apps but the proper types instead.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tLivewire is a nice technology to use in dynamic Laravel apps. Caleb Porzio shares how it works and how to use it in a deep dive article.\n\tIf you’re using Laravel already, here’s a nice alternative to the hosted services for adding a support bubble to your website.\n\tVizzu is a library for animated data visualizations and data stories. Here’s an overview of what it can do.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares how we can do conditional border-radius today but future holds a much more readable approach for us.\n\tChris Coyier shares future additions currently in development for CSS, and they’re super cool. It would allow for native nesting, container queries and units, cascade layers, @when (native if/else), and scoping. Alle we ever wished for in the past decade.\n\tDavid Hall explains how much of a difference a well crafted drop shadow makes for interaction. I love these detailed explanations of something that looks very simple.\n\tChris Coyier on the different degrees of custom property usage and why the decision how to do it fully depends on the context of the team and project we’re working in.\n\tFirst of all I’m convinced that absolute positioning in CSS has its value and its use-cases. But in many cases it also creates new problems, especially in responsive and modular contexts. So this documentation of use-cases where we don’t need absolute positioning in CSS anymore is great.\n\tMikael Ainalem shares an approach to create pop-out effects in CSS using clip-path().\n\tWe know a lot of the techniques highlighted in this article from our work as CSS developers. But gladly with new techniques we can switch away from pseudo-element hacks to more stable solutions today.\n\tThere’s a new CSS property called accent-color which makes it quick and easy to roll out global styles.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tLong time ago I wrote this piece and had the intend to let it publish somewhere else. But it didn’t happen so here it is on my personal blog: It’s time for a healthy tech approach.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tBerwyn Powell considers the impact of a web application or website on carbon emissions and how we can reduce them as developers.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

Which is nice because I now don’t spend any thoughts and nerves on discussions about »native HTML« and similar things that drive Twitter’s platform and make it so negative. When reading my Twitter feed, often a little bit later than the tweets were written, so many things seem unnecessary to me. Previously, I struggled with it a lot and spent hours wasting time on topics that in reality aren’t relevant to me as a person or for our community.

While this is very useful, don’t style them unless you really need this. Also, keep in mind the different light/dark modes and high contrast and other media queries and helpful accessibility functionality.\n\tThis layout generator lets you create and adjust CSS Grid layouts very easily with a UI.\n\tLet’s talk about Flexbox: “How can we create equal columns with Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/)? This is the best example to show why we now have Flexbox and CSS Grid but none could ever replace the other, they’re for different purposes.\n\tLayoutIt! is another layout generator for CSS Grids, a bit different in its UI than the other one mentioned in the newsletter.

Designed for React and Vue.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tFork is a lightweight solution for running PHP code concurrently.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tSandrina Pereira explains us how to make disabled buttons more inclusive.\n\tKitty Giraudel shares how to implement an accessible toggle component in your app.\n\tVitaly Friedman wrote up a complete guide to accessible front-end components. This is worth reading it again from time to time.\n\nCSS\n\n\tDavid Bushell argues for using start and end as syntax instead of left and right for a more universal layout language.\n\tAdam Argyle shares how to create split-text animations and word animations the proper way.\n\tJim Nielsen reveals the system colors we can use in CSS and how useful this can be for light and dark mode themes.\n\tBarry Pollard shares how we can control font loading with less impact to the rendering with the cool new CSS Font Descriptors feature.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThis is a great piece of content on how less is often more. Kent C. Dodds shares with the example of electric cars why sometimes we need to think entirely different to what we’re used to to simplify things. Electric cars need less maintenance and are easier to build because they need less parts. If we apply that to our life, or to building websites we can save ourselves from a lot of trouble.\n\tJulia Evans shares helpful advice on how to improve the relationship to your manager by telling them thing they might not know, such as why the team might be slow, what the technical debt is, what goals you may have, the extra work people in the team are doing, and more.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

I’ve neglected this project since January this year and just now found enough time to bring it back to life. Why to life? Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget it’s a great option.\nI’m busy with my market garden business growing lots of food which works fine despite weather surprises us here again with colder than usual temperatures and lots of rain over the past weeks. But we now serve over 40 customers, which means we give food to around 80 – 100 people every week during growing period. This is an awesome feeling!\nIn parallel I spend a lot of time seeing my son grow up, playing with him. When there’s enough time I work on small website projects and try to organize an event about soil and climate action in summer here in Germany. Let’s see if it’s possible to make this event real.\nThe political and social situation we’re currently in continues to baffle me and surprise me. Mostly not in a positive way though which means I’m spending more time reflecting on my thoughts and news, meditating for my mind and to stay sane and calm. I stuggle to accept that so many people have hardline-thoughts in a specific direction, I don’t even care so much in which one. But I think we’re still individuals and every single person should be able to think on their own and decide on their own (thinking as a social, empathic being).\nNews\n\n\tSafari 14.1 is an interesting one because it’s a minor update but brings great joy for us developers: Flexbox gap support, Date & Time Inputs on macOS (woohoo!), WebM support to name the big ones.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tUna Kravets recaps the new complexity of building modern responsive designs for the web.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nWelcome to another new year, 2021. WDRL is now seven and a half year old already and the first edition had about twenty email subscribers. What was in there? We had webfont loading behaviour, Speedcurve, a HTML validator, GrumpIcon which created PNG fallbacks for SVG icons via Grunt (remember?), and we moved away from jQuery and started using native JS functions instead. This throwback was quite interesting for me this week. Some topics are still relevant today while others have completely disappeared or solved.\nComing 2021 we now get the ability to slowly replace old hacky code for aspect-ratio with Chrome supporting it now in the latest stable (88), Firefox as well behind flags and in Safari Tech Preview. But we still heavily need CanIUse as project to lookup browser compatibility — thanks so much for building it, Fyrd!\nNot every new year needs new habits, new spectacular projects. It’s enough to realign our minds, our goals, our perspectives. It’s a good time to reconsider active or stale projects, clean up old stuff, declutter or start one new thing.\nI’m personally dedicating a lot of time currently into my Market Gardening business as well as playing with my son in spare time. Besides that, I started organizing my web development business and declutter it. There’s no time to hold on to projects that aren’t in active development or I don’t like anymore but also don’t bring me joy or money.  \nI’m also actively looking for small website projects currently so if you know something or need someone building a small company/project website, email me.\nIf you know about an environmental, social or humanity project that needs my help and could hire me (reduced rate possible) for a limited time, connect me.\nI wish you all the best, health and joy.\nNews\n\n\tChrome 88 is out and brings CSS aspect-ratio to all users, it defaults target=\"_blank\" to treat as rel=\"no-opener\" always by default (which is now the web standard).\n\nGeneric\n\n\tThe Sustainable Web Manifesto is a statement we can all sign to make the web less of a CO2 polluter and more sustainable, in all regards.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tOliver Schöndorfer shares how to choose a typeface for apps and UIs. It’s a great read that shows the difference between normal, good and excellent app design. He also has a new YouTube channel for Better Type.\n\nTooling\n\n\tIntegrating Stripe can be quite a complex task and switching between documentation and code editor can be annoying. So Stripe now has a VS Code extension that brings the Stripe environment into your code editor and makes this task so much more comfortable.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tAddy Osmani wrote another insightful guide how to import code on interaction to save traffic and improve performance on web apps. It’s definitely the gold standard of blog articles, and probably gold standard for web apps, if you implement this.\n\tMathias Schäfer with a new article on maintaining javascript applications in the long term, describing the approach for an app built in 2014. Describing why they still use Backbone.js instead of their agency standard React, how they moved from CoffeeScript to TypeScript, handle documentation and maintain a test suite, Mathias concludes why abstractions may bite you in future.\n\nCSS\n\n\tBramus Van Damme shares that we can nest Media Queries. Interesting that most of us have never heard about it.\n\tMelanie Richards writes how we can integrate sticky elements into CSS Grid layouts without many hacks or side-effects.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tExxon, the oil company, knows its carbon future and keeps the data from view. They know that they’re one of the biggest polluters in the world, yet they’re not ready to change something. But given our business and economical system, can we judge them? At least not fully, simply stepping out of the business would make them bankrupt. So it remains an interesting, challenging issue of our generation to solve the economical and ecological problems of this industry so save our society.\n\n\nI hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nWelcome to another new year, 2021. WDRL is now seven and a half year old already and the first edition had about twenty email subscribers. What was in there? We had webfont loading behaviour, Speedcurve, a HTML validator, GrumpIcon which created PNG fallbacks for SVG icons via Grunt (remember?), and we moved away from jQuery and started using native JS functions instead. This throwback was quite interesting for me this week. Some topics are still relevant today while others have completely disappeared or solved.\nComing 2021 we now get the ability to slowly replace old hacky code for aspect-ratio with Chrome supporting it now in the latest stable (88), Firefox as well behind flags and in Safari Tech Preview. But we still heavily need CanIUse as project to lookup browser compatibility — thanks so much for building it, Fyrd!\nNot every new year needs new habits, new spectacular projects.

We still don’t know how to deal with the new kinds of diseases short and long-term. We still have no real clue and conclusion how to save our planet (means us humans, the planet will survive). Many of us now are in a state of uncertainty, of frustration, of stress. Working remotely isn’t easy for all of us, the split between childcare and work is hard,  and our social contacts have been reduced to the minimum. That’s definitely not a combination that makes our lives easy, calm and ourselves happy. That’s why I found this writing so useful: News is the last thing we need right now but it’s addictive like a drug. Reading this made me finally block all the major news sites. I’m already two weeks in, and it feels quite good. And fear not, it’s not that I don’t know about the important news, there are still enough ways to get them from other people. It’s simply that you don’t fetch them actively and don’t fall into the trap of getting caught by another handful of articles. \nI hope you all can enjoy the end of the year, make it a calm and nice time despite of all the things happening all over the world, despite all the articles here, all the news around us and all the other people sharing their fears, their concerns and annoyances with us. Let’s try to reframe it, show empathy, listen to people and try to understand them. Read you in 2021 again, thanks for everything to you, your support, your money gifts, your article suggestions, your conversations via email. I’m really grateful for this audience.\nGeneric\n\n\tEric Bailey on how we can create more eco-friendly websites. Some pretty handy tricks in there, some very simple ones, some that can’t be applied to every project.\n\tAVIF, the file format based on the AV1 video codec, is the latest addition to the next-gen image formats. Now this article shares a couple of things we should know before we blindly use this new format for everything. WebP, for example, performs better for thumbnails, and if the picture has a high entropy, JPEG can still deliver better results at a smaller size. Funnily, JPEG2000 which never kicked off really still challenges most of the other formats today. And if you’re now unsure what to do, using mozJPEG is still one of the best compromises you can use today.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAdam Silver shares why we should be more careful designing tab styles for use cases that aren’t or shouldn’t be tabs.\n\tScale is a nice set of illustrations for free, even for commercial projects. The nice thing? You can set the main color easily in the SVG and adapt them to your brand color.\n\nTooling\n\n\tBlurhash is a nice library that creates blurs for image placeholders. Now here’s alos a pure PHP implementation of it.\n\tPlaiceholder is a simple online tool where you can upload an image and get a CSS, SVG, Base64, Blurhash, or React element that acts as blur placeholder until the real image is loaded. A nice tool for when you just need this a once or a couple of times.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tKilian Valkhof shares concepts and examples of how we can integrate the prefers-reduced-data setting into our websites. With it, we can disable web font loading, not load background images, or using picture and its media query attribute to load smaller images than normal. We can even prevent preloading or autoplay of videos, disable infinite scrolling preloads (we could improve the example using IntersectionObserver). It’s super cool to see these practical implementations which don’t even require much effort but have a huge benefit to users with a limited data budget (international roaming, etc).\n\tJames Ross shares how we can use Cloudflare Workers and CSS to deliver new image formats like AVIF. It’s pretty cool that James has some real use cases here and even shows the real life impact data.\n\tNoam Rosenthal on how they made their Wikipedia page previews fast. A nice insight into JavaScript’s heavy functions and how to easily or not replace them.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tRobin Rendle explores what we can do with the <details>/<summary> elements in HTML and CSS. Ever thought that we could de-animate (pause) a gif? We can do inline-block footnotes or build tooltips with it!\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tJeremy Keith created a simple gist to save form input via localStorage to avoid content being lost when something happens to the client browser or the server resets the connection due to security.\n\nCSS\n\n\tEver tried to build a visual calendar with CSS? You may end up with tables and styling a lot of things. What’s much simpler is now that we have CSS Grid using this cool technology to build a basic calendar in three lines of CSS.\n\tIf you want to have a clickable card interface, things can easily get tricky due to the fact that we can’t nest links in HTML. Christian Heilmann shares a way how to do it the right way but always keep in mind that UX and accessibility may still be impacted by this design pattern which is why nested links aren’t a native thing in HTML.\n\tBramus Van Damme writes how to use the new aspect-ratio CSS property in browsers to replace these ugly padding-top hacks we used to apply to iframe embeds. Unfortunately, this is not baked into stable browsers yet but we can already use the setting and later strip the fallbacks from the codebase.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIt makes me really happy to see such an amazing project: Field Notes: Snowmaker. A story how to make 99999 unique snow flakes. My dream? Brendan (or someone else) is allowed and paid for drawing all these snow flakes by hand. Nature is amazing, craft is amazing and we should embrace it. Thanks Field Notes for doing this project.\n\n\nThank you for reading this.

A nice insight into JavaScript’s heavy functions and how to easily or not replace them.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tRobin Rendle explores what we can do with the <details>/<summary> elements in HTML and CSS. Ever thought that we could de-animate (pause) a gif? We can do inline-block footnotes or build tooltips with it!\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tJeremy Keith created a simple gist to save form input via localStorage to avoid content being lost when something happens to the client browser or the server resets the connection due to security.\n\nCSS\n\n\tEver tried to build a visual calendar with CSS? You may end up with tables and styling a lot of things. What’s much simpler is now that we have CSS Grid using this cool technology to build a basic calendar in three lines of CSS.\n\tIf you want to have a clickable card interface, things can easily get tricky due to the fact that we can’t nest links in HTML. Christian Heilmann shares a way how to do it the right way but always keep in mind that UX and accessibility may still be impacted by this design pattern which is why nested links aren’t a native thing in HTML.\n\tBramus Van Damme writes how to use the new aspect-ratio CSS property in browsers to replace these ugly padding-top hacks we used to apply to iframe embeds. Unfortunately, this is not baked into stable browsers yet but we can already use the setting and later strip the fallbacks from the codebase.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIt makes me really happy to see such an amazing project: Field Notes: Snowmaker. A story how to make 99999 unique snow flakes. My dream? Brendan (or someone else) is allowed and paid for drawing all these snow flakes by hand. Nature is amazing, craft is amazing and we should embrace it. Thanks Field Notes for doing this project.\n\n\nThank you for reading this. I hope you’re doing fine and have a way to stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nNow there we go with a new writing. For me, this year has been quite different so far. And no, this is mostly not about some virus spreading across the world but about changing a lot in my work and personal life. My son keeps teaching me new skills, patience, happiness. My gardening project went well the first year and we’re scaling it next year so we can grow vegetables for more than 70 people. Not to stop here, we created a network for workshops and events where local people share their knowledge to improve farming, gardening and live a more resilient and sustainable life as humans.\nOn the other hand, being away from client work for half a year was incredibly useful. I now have a different view on some projects again, I refocused on what’s important in projects and got away from just coding and first ask about the goals, about how to achieve them before starting to dive into code. It was one part that I was missing in my job lately but didn’t realize. By talking to other people out there from a huge variety of professional backgrounds instead of constantly living in the bubble of web developers, I gained a different view of looking at and using websites, of how technology is used and how important (or sometimes unimportant) technology is for people.\nOn a last note, I’m currently available for a small frontend/fullstack project so if you know something or need someone like me, talk to me. Bonus if it’s for a sustainable company, project or has a positive environmental impact.  \nIn full honesty, Gardening is lot of fun, often really hard work, but also not super well paid. And I think I’m not ready to drop web development entirely, it can be so much fun as well!\nNews\n\n\tOh yes, two new Firefox versions are here, v82 and v83 and they bring us DevTool inspection of server-send events, the Media Session API, CSS ::file-selector-button (yay!), conic-gradient, WebRender, Pinch to zoom on desktop, and more.\n\tSafari 14 is here and brings Web Extensions, Webpage Translation, Performance improvements, interoperability and better standards and compatibility by improving Web Platform Test passes. Safari now has a privacy report that shows trackers and third party data issues on a webpage to users quite prominently, it brings WebP support, supports CSS image-orientation, :is(), :where() (resetting specificity for the selector to 0, wohoo). JavaScript gets BigInt support and optional chaining via ?..\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tBetsy Mikel shares how to write microcopy that improves the user experience even with a strategy how to analyze microcopy and how to collect feedback.\n\nTooling\n\n\tUpptime is an open source uptime and status page system, powered entirely by GitHub Actions and Issues. Cool!\n\nSecurity\n\n\tCrowdsec is an open-source, lightweight service (written in Go) to detect and respond to bad behaviours and uses a global community-wide IP reputation database. Heard of fail2ban? This is a more modern approach of the service.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tPostgres doesn’t stop to surprise me (positively). James Coleman shares some tips on how to save space nearly for free by using a custom Ruby gem.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tTomek Sułkowski gave us a nice tip in a tweet: Using autocomplete=\"one-time-code\" in a form field will auto-fill an 2-FA code from messages or other apps in some browsers like Safari. This is such a nice UX and so simple to build in.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere’s Atkinson, a new free and hyperlegible font published by the Braille institute.\n\tNataly Birch on email design accessibility best practices with a good few handful of tips what we can do better in emails and why we and our users benefit from it.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tPhilip Walton shares how to build a back/forward (“bfcache” cache for nearly instant loading of pages when a user uses the browser history buttons. To be honest, I didn’t know this exists until I read the article and it’s super interesting. It’s basically a different cache layer that keeps a live capture of the page including the JavaScript heap in a separate cache. But due to this, it’s not always easy to handle, especially if you have events running on the page so this article contains the answers how to observe the bfcache and add handlers to it. In summary it’s a super powerful feature that’s incredibly useful for web apps but a normal website doesn’t need this layer of complexity.\n\tThis date picker is very nice, flexible, pretty universal and accessible. I know there are many others out there but it’s one that’s working well, working with many coding platforms and is well usable by people.\n\tNice, Apple now lets us integrate Face ID and Touch ID on the web, building it on top of the Web Authentication API. Imagine how this can improve the logging in experience for a good part of your user base.\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can integrate the Web Share API into our websites instead of these ugly lists of social icons. Note that this depends on us how well it’s perceived and working. For example on macOS it’s supported but most apps on the Mac don’t integrate the Framework for it so they don’t show up in the list of sharing services. We should take care that our products support the native frameworks to make the web a better place.\n\tWonder which operator to use in JavaScript for a comparison? Or seen a code snippet and felt weird because you didn’t know what operator this was? Josh W Comeau has built an operator lookup.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares a nice approach of centering a container with sub-elements like a navigation with the fit-content property in CSS. Unfortunately, this still needs vendor prefixes at the moment to work in major browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the CSS Grid minmax() function with some really good examples. Most tutorials explaining this function are very generic and not practical so this was a nice read when I found it. In case you don’t fully understand the minmax syntax yet, give it a read.\n\tIf you use Tailwind CSS or consider to use it, this amazing post on color theming is for you. But also if you don’t use Tailwind there’s at least a good part of the article that we can learn something from in terms of setting colors in CSS.\n\tJosh W. Cameau has a CSS Grid full-bleed layout tutorial that’s pretty complete and includes lots of nice throwbacks into the history of the web.\n\tCSS Text effects are rarely useful but sometimes for big teaser headlines it’s what we need. And if we need them, it’s sometimes not so easy to create a nice and really good effect so this article showing five CSS Text effects is great and includes split colored text, video text, and image background text.\n\tThere are a lot of basic tutorials on CSS Variables but this one contains some pretty handy use cases for variables that go beyond the basic color variable usage but show how we can build a flexible avatar box, defining paddings or gaps by using calc() and variables together.\n\tTalking about colors in CSS, we have Josh Bader sharing how we can use CSS variables calc() and rgb() to enforce high contrast colors in our CSS design system.\n\tRachel Andrew shares how we can build a Masonry layout fully in CSS with CSS Grid Level 3.\n\tDave Rupert explores how we should define semantic variable names in the age of light and dark themes.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEngineering Manager is one of the roles that most people don’t know exactly what it’s about and what these people do. That’s why I found Karl Hughes’ »A day in the life of an Engineering Manager« a really nice one to read. He explains what he does all day and it turns out it’s a role full of soft skills like networking, explaining things or translating between two people, between company departments and to raise awareness around delivery, around process management and recruiting as well as people’s happiness in their jobs. I was Engineering Manager for quite some time as well so I can second what Karl writes here.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou know what scares me most when it comes to climate change and how we as humans perceive it? That we don’t notice that our climate is changing slowly but steadily. Every time a big tornado or wildfires destroy lots of things, our habitats, we read dozens of articles in the news, watch it in TV. But we barely notice that the climate already changed for everyone in the world, that temperatures grew already, that the four seasons changed a little bit, that we face more and more inconsistencies in the weather, more things like wildfires.  I’m not sure if it’s the protection mode in our brains that blocks this away or if it’s just too hard to notice these tiny events when so much other stuff is going on in our lives.\n\tWho is responsible for climate change? The complexity of the problem makes a simple answer elusive. And yet, responsibility matters—not just for assigning blame, but for finding strategic levers for future change. Here’s insight, here’s evidence, here’s a good article to help us understand our biggest problem of humanity yet a bit better. And remember that most plastic is made out of oil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

Safari now has a privacy report that shows trackers and third party data issues on a webpage to users quite prominently, it brings WebP support, supports CSS image-orientation, :is(), :where() (resetting specificity for the selector to 0, wohoo). JavaScript gets BigInt support and optional chaining via ?..\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tBetsy Mikel shares how to write microcopy that improves the user experience even with a strategy how to analyze microcopy and how to collect feedback.\n\nTooling\n\n\tUpptime is an open source uptime and status page system, powered entirely by GitHub Actions and Issues. Cool!\n\nSecurity\n\n\tCrowdsec is an open-source, lightweight service (written in Go) to detect and respond to bad behaviours and uses a global community-wide IP reputation database. Heard of fail2ban? This is a more modern approach of the service.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tPostgres doesn’t stop to surprise me (positively). James Coleman shares some tips on how to save space nearly for free by using a custom Ruby gem.\n\nHTML & SVG\n\n\tTomek Sułkowski gave us a nice tip in a tweet: Using autocomplete=\"one-time-code\" in a form field will auto-fill an 2-FA code from messages or other apps in some browsers like Safari. This is such a nice UX and so simple to build in.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere’s Atkinson, a new free and hyperlegible font published by the Braille institute.\n\tNataly Birch on email design accessibility best practices with a good few handful of tips what we can do better in emails and why we and our users benefit from it.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tPhilip Walton shares how to build a back/forward (“bfcache” cache for nearly instant loading of pages when a user uses the browser history buttons. To be honest, I didn’t know this exists until I read the article and it’s super interesting. It’s basically a different cache layer that keeps a live capture of the page including the JavaScript heap in a separate cache. But due to this, it’s not always easy to handle, especially if you have events running on the page so this article contains the answers how to observe the bfcache and add handlers to it. In summary it’s a super powerful feature that’s incredibly useful for web apps but a normal website doesn’t need this layer of complexity.\n\tThis date picker is very nice, flexible, pretty universal and accessible. I know there are many others out there but it’s one that’s working well, working with many coding platforms and is well usable by people.\n\tNice, Apple now lets us integrate Face ID and Touch ID on the web, building it on top of the Web Authentication API. Imagine how this can improve the logging in experience for a good part of your user base.\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can integrate the Web Share API into our websites instead of these ugly lists of social icons. Note that this depends on us how well it’s perceived and working. For example on macOS it’s supported but most apps on the Mac don’t integrate the Framework for it so they don’t show up in the list of sharing services. We should take care that our products support the native frameworks to make the web a better place.\n\tWonder which operator to use in JavaScript for a comparison? Or seen a code snippet and felt weird because you didn’t know what operator this was? Josh W Comeau has built an operator lookup.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStefan Judis shares a nice approach of centering a container with sub-elements like a navigation with the fit-content property in CSS. Unfortunately, this still needs vendor prefixes at the moment to work in major browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the CSS Grid minmax() function with some really good examples. Most tutorials explaining this function are very generic and not practical so this was a nice read when I found it. In case you don’t fully understand the minmax syntax yet, give it a read.\n\tIf you use Tailwind CSS or consider to use it, this amazing post on color theming is for you. But also if you don’t use Tailwind there’s at least a good part of the article that we can learn something from in terms of setting colors in CSS.\n\tJosh W. Cameau has a CSS Grid full-bleed layout tutorial that’s pretty complete and includes lots of nice throwbacks into the history of the web.\n\tCSS Text effects are rarely useful but sometimes for big teaser headlines it’s what we need. And if we need them, it’s sometimes not so easy to create a nice and really good effect so this article showing five CSS Text effects is great and includes split colored text, video text, and image background text.\n\tThere are a lot of basic tutorials on CSS Variables but this one contains some pretty handy use cases for variables that go beyond the basic color variable usage but show how we can build a flexible avatar box, defining paddings or gaps by using calc() and variables together.\n\tTalking about colors in CSS, we have Josh Bader sharing how we can use CSS variables calc() and rgb() to enforce high contrast colors in our CSS design system.\n\tRachel Andrew shares how we can build a Masonry layout fully in CSS with CSS Grid Level 3.\n\tDave Rupert explores how we should define semantic variable names in the age of light and dark themes.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEngineering Manager is one of the roles that most people don’t know exactly what it’s about and what these people do. That’s why I found Karl Hughes’ »A day in the life of an Engineering Manager« a really nice one to read. He explains what he does all day and it turns out it’s a role full of soft skills like networking, explaining things or translating between two people, between company departments and to raise awareness around delivery, around process management and recruiting as well as people’s happiness in their jobs. I was Engineering Manager for quite some time as well so I can second what Karl writes here.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou know what scares me most when it comes to climate change and how we as humans perceive it? That we don’t notice that our climate is changing slowly but steadily. Every time a big tornado or wildfires destroy lots of things, our habitats, we read dozens of articles in the news, watch it in TV. But we barely notice that the climate already changed for everyone in the world, that temperatures grew already, that the four seasons changed a little bit, that we face more and more inconsistencies in the weather, more things like wildfires.  I’m not sure if it’s the protection mode in our brains that blocks this away or if it’s just too hard to notice these tiny events when so much other stuff is going on in our lives.\n\tWho is responsible for climate change? The complexity of the problem makes a simple answer elusive. And yet, responsibility matters—not just for assigning blame, but for finding strategic levers for future change. Here’s insight, here’s evidence, here’s a good article to help us understand our biggest problem of humanity yet a bit better. And remember that most plastic is made out of oil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\n\n“You can run-away, run-away, run-away… you gotta face this… time is running fast…” — Snoop Lion in his song ‘Rebel Way’\n\nWe can apply this quote to a lot of matters in our lives right now. Our time to do something for ourselves, for our relatives, our animals, our planet is running fast. And whether it’s about voting, about the actions to fight a pendemic or to fight to get back our human rights and freedom in face of country lock-downs, or in the fight against global warming which is getting harder each year we don’t do enough.\nHave we considered the impact of our current system to develop, deploy, test and run our Internet services on the planet? How much energy is used to create all these Docker images, to run all the VMs and hardware machines that are just there to run Continuous Integration systems and get rebuilt from scratch each time we push a little piece of code? Now considering that no provider is yet powering their server clusters completely CO2 neutral, not event trying to count the energy and sources we need to build all the hardware in there, this suddenly shines in a not so bright light. At the same time we destroy the biggest value we have as humans: Our soil. By using farming techniques, chemicals that destroy the soil long-term and building more and more houses and business units on the soil, we destroy our ability to produce food that keeps us living. And then we face a pandemic and wonder why… it’s time to act. Not just to watch another video stream. To reduce our impact, to reduce our energy consumption, our car drives, our use of chemicals that hurt ourselves. And instead, we should focus on what’s doing good to us… nature, calmness, friendship, love, kindness.\nNews\n\n\tPostgres 13 was released and brings performance benefits, application development conveniences such as native UUIDv4 generation, or datetime() support in the JSON path. Here’s an in-depth review including code how to use the new things in v13.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tSteve Messer explains us why his website is killing the planet — or is it really? We can do something.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tChris Coyier shows us how to offer options for mailto: and tel: links in a custom popup modal.\n\tSystem UIcons is a set of icons under Unlicense so you can use without attribution for free (but it’s even cooler if you add an attribution).\n\nTooling\n\n\tumami is a simple self-hosted open web analytics platform.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tterjanq provides us with a collection of short XSS payloads that can be used in different contexts. Pretty cool to do some security testing on our applications.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\tThe browser Chrome is changing the default Referrer-Policy and is now using strict-origin-when-cross-origin by default. That will be for the benefit of the users’ privacy. Of course, if you want to enable another type of policy, you can still do.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tInfinite scrolling is used a lot across the web, especially for item listings. Now the key for this cool way to ease a flow for the user is to implement this right and without layout shift or other glitches. Addy Osmani shows how to avoid layout shifts in infinite scolling. And don’t forget to update the URL to the next paging so if something goes wrong and the user needs to reload the page, they see the same state again.\n\tAVIF is the new hot image format that we can use on the web. Finally, it’s a standard format that’s going to be implemented by probably all browsers quite quickly. Chrome already has support on Desktop and it’s coming to Android soon, Firefox is currently implementing it and Apple is part of the AV1 working group so they’ll probably add it as well soon. Anyway, you can already use the new image format by using the picture element and content negotiation methods as we do it for WebP or other formats already. But why AVIF? Well, it’s a standard that is accepted by many major software companies and it’s really good in compressing images while still looking good. In many cases it’s much better than WebP, and it’s really good for not only photos but also illustrations.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMicrosoft had it for years already as proprietary solution on their platform, now Mozilla added support for the standard Media Query prefers-contrast in Firefox. This means that some colors are enforced by the browser to ensure better contrast and now we can serve high contrast modes of our websites to more users.\n\tDave Rupert appeals for writing alt attribute values like paragraphs so in case of an image loading failure or a screen reader, the user still gets a really good description of what’s to be seen here. This is good, I do this a lot already but one thing to say is that it’s still an attribute so we can’t really write more than one paragraph there. Alternatively, you can still use figure and figcaption elements for this use case and just leave the img element’s alt attribute empty. Never omit the attribute, please, by the way.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tinclusive-dates is a really well made human-friendly datepicker that’s also fully accessible.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAna Tudor shows the future of CSS masonry solutions with CSS Grid. But as support is very limited and yet to be implemented by many browsers, we need a fallback which Ana shows as well in the tutorial.\n\tWonder how to make a gradient colored text nowadays? Serving it as an image or SVG isn’t necessary, Adam Argyle shows us in a Codepen how it can be solved using background-clip and other CSS properties.\n\tWhile we all use box-shadow a lot, the lesser known drop-shadow property is a really cool one: it creates a shadow around the element’s clippings instead of their box-model. Maybe you remember how to create triangles with just some  borders. Using drop-shadow let’s us define a shadow on such elements.\n\tAdam Argyle and Oriol Brufau share how to make custom bullets in a HTML list using the CSS ::marker pseudo-element selectors. This is good because it’s standardizing things we used to hack since years.\n\tStephanie Eckles with a new great tutorial how to apply a custom look to native HTML input fields with the latest methods.\n\tLinearly scale font-size with CSS clamp() based on the viewport. The solution we looked for since a long time is now available in browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the mindset we should use when coding CSS: Just in case.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tCaring about the climate but don’t find things to help? Climatebase is a platform that offers events and jobs to find in the fight against climate change.\n\tMatthias Ott with some simple, honest words on why the change of climate affects us, directly.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou remember I posted a link to a website that’s entirely powered by Solar? Here’s the follow-up that shares how sustainable the project is. Well, crazy how unsustainable technology most of the time is, right?\n\tNigeria′s Bayo Akomolafe: “We aren′t ′in control′ of climate crisis” This interesting read gives us some insight into other cultures and how we could treat our nature and living environment differently to how we’re used to do right now.\n\tWhy soil matters. A good summary of why we should take more care on the soil we live on, we live from. I myself am going to hold workshops and talks beginning next year here in southern Germany about solutions how to take care of soil, how to restore it, preserve it and bind CO2 in the atmosphere in the soil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

And instead, we should focus on what’s doing good to us… nature, calmness, friendship, love, kindness.\nNews\n\n\tPostgres 13 was released and brings performance benefits, application development conveniences such as native UUIDv4 generation, or datetime() support in the JSON path. Here’s an in-depth review including code how to use the new things in v13.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tSteve Messer explains us why his website is killing the planet — or is it really? We can do something.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tChris Coyier shows us how to offer options for mailto: and tel: links in a custom popup modal.\n\tSystem UIcons is a set of icons under Unlicense so you can use without attribution for free (but it’s even cooler if you add an attribution).\n\nTooling\n\n\tumami is a simple self-hosted open web analytics platform.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tterjanq provides us with a collection of short XSS payloads that can be used in different contexts. Pretty cool to do some security testing on our applications.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\tThe browser Chrome is changing the default Referrer-Policy and is now using strict-origin-when-cross-origin by default. That will be for the benefit of the users’ privacy. Of course, if you want to enable another type of policy, you can still do.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tInfinite scrolling is used a lot across the web, especially for item listings. Now the key for this cool way to ease a flow for the user is to implement this right and without layout shift or other glitches. Addy Osmani shows how to avoid layout shifts in infinite scolling. And don’t forget to update the URL to the next paging so if something goes wrong and the user needs to reload the page, they see the same state again.\n\tAVIF is the new hot image format that we can use on the web. Finally, it’s a standard format that’s going to be implemented by probably all browsers quite quickly. Chrome already has support on Desktop and it’s coming to Android soon, Firefox is currently implementing it and Apple is part of the AV1 working group so they’ll probably add it as well soon. Anyway, you can already use the new image format by using the picture element and content negotiation methods as we do it for WebP or other formats already. But why AVIF? Well, it’s a standard that is accepted by many major software companies and it’s really good in compressing images while still looking good. In many cases it’s much better than WebP, and it’s really good for not only photos but also illustrations.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tMicrosoft had it for years already as proprietary solution on their platform, now Mozilla added support for the standard Media Query prefers-contrast in Firefox. This means that some colors are enforced by the browser to ensure better contrast and now we can serve high contrast modes of our websites to more users.\n\tDave Rupert appeals for writing alt attribute values like paragraphs so in case of an image loading failure or a screen reader, the user still gets a really good description of what’s to be seen here. This is good, I do this a lot already but one thing to say is that it’s still an attribute so we can’t really write more than one paragraph there. Alternatively, you can still use figure and figcaption elements for this use case and just leave the img element’s alt attribute empty. Never omit the attribute, please, by the way.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tinclusive-dates is a really well made human-friendly datepicker that’s also fully accessible.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAna Tudor shows the future of CSS masonry solutions with CSS Grid. But as support is very limited and yet to be implemented by many browsers, we need a fallback which Ana shows as well in the tutorial.\n\tWonder how to make a gradient colored text nowadays? Serving it as an image or SVG isn’t necessary, Adam Argyle shows us in a Codepen how it can be solved using background-clip and other CSS properties.\n\tWhile we all use box-shadow a lot, the lesser known drop-shadow property is a really cool one: it creates a shadow around the element’s clippings instead of their box-model. Maybe you remember how to create triangles with just some  borders. Using drop-shadow let’s us define a shadow on such elements.\n\tAdam Argyle and Oriol Brufau share how to make custom bullets in a HTML list using the CSS ::marker pseudo-element selectors. This is good because it’s standardizing things we used to hack since years.\n\tStephanie Eckles with a new great tutorial how to apply a custom look to native HTML input fields with the latest methods.\n\tLinearly scale font-size with CSS clamp() based on the viewport. The solution we looked for since a long time is now available in browsers.\n\tAhmad Shadeed explains the mindset we should use when coding CSS: Just in case.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tCaring about the climate but don’t find things to help? Climatebase is a platform that offers events and jobs to find in the fight against climate change.\n\tMatthias Ott with some simple, honest words on why the change of climate affects us, directly.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tYou remember I posted a link to a website that’s entirely powered by Solar? Here’s the follow-up that shares how sustainable the project is. Well, crazy how unsustainable technology most of the time is, right?\n\tNigeria′s Bayo Akomolafe: “We aren′t ′in control′ of climate crisis” This interesting read gives us some insight into other cultures and how we could treat our nature and living environment differently to how we’re used to do right now.\n\tWhy soil matters. A good summary of why we should take more care on the soil we live on, we live from. I myself am going to hold workshops and talks beginning next year here in southern Germany about solutions how to take care of soil, how to restore it, preserve it and bind CO2 in the atmosphere in the soil.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

We influence whether there will be a war, how many cars are produced, how many pesticides are sprayed across our planet, how many trees in the rainforests are cut, how many planes are polluting  the air we breathe. Every single cent is spent either to a good cause or a bad cause and if we’d bear that in mind every day, we probably would change our shopping behaviour.\nWe can opt for renewable energy in our homes, at the workplace, we can buy natural, organic, non processed food. We don’t need to buy a new iPhone every year, a new car every two or five years, we don’t need to fly to far away destinations just for vacation. We don’t need to buy cheap meat, plastics, a pair of Jeans manufactured by poor children who breath chemicals and colors every day because of what we buy.\nWe’re a small dot in evolution but we can change where we are on the line.

Better don’t install any extension even from a “trusted marketplace” like Google’s.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tLearn how to design beautiful and accessible link focus states in this tutorial by Ethan Marcotte.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tAda Rose Cannon shares how we can animate DOM changes in JavaScript.\n\tIf we want to look for a specific index in JavaScript we don’t need to use any complex loop with a stop anymore but instead can use Array.prototype.findIndex() which returns the index of the first match of our testing function.\n\tWenson Hsieh shares how to use the Async Clipboard API and the differences and advantages over the methods we used in the past.\n\tiOS Safari 13.4+ allows us to block back and forward navigation gestures.

Because what doesn’t serve the mission is burning ourselves out which happens if we just strive for more productivity when it doesn’t serve our own deepest mission.\n\tFinally, there’s a resource to find ethical job sites for freelancers instead of ending up on sites that try to exploit us.\n\tLucas Miller is neuroscientist and he sees Slack as a particularly “scary offender” in stopping people getting their work done because it encourages them to be constantly distracted. Of course that isn’t only about Slack but about all the messenger style chat systems we use — no matter if made by an independent company, Microsoft, Facebook or any other.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIf we frame our own life a little bit different, in evolutionary context, everything we do, everything we see as given or as inherited by our parents can be seen a bit different. We’re then only a small dot in evolution and yet, we are the only ones who can still decide whether the human species will continue to be part of evolution on our planet or not. Evolution is a quite simple concept.\n\tLet’s try to understand why biodiversity is collapsing worldwide at the moment. It means that less species of animals are around in our ecosystem and climate change is fueling it while our agriculture is actively killing the living ground and plants these species need to live. Weirdly, we fail to understand that we won’t get any food, wood and other things that are vital to our health and ability to live if there is no biodiversity anymore. Technology won’t save us in that case, it can only help understand the issue and maybe help improve the situation but the major impact is how we act, what we buy and how we farm.\n\tWe are facing one of the biggest decisions of humankind — a decision on how to face the climate crisis. This is a huge responsibility and at the same time an opportunity. Our chance to work together to initiate a comprehensive change towards a more just society. Here’s the Grassroots Climate Plan with a solid plan what we need and can do to change the current state of burning down our own habitat.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

Better don’t install any extension even from a “trusted marketplace” like Google’s.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tLearn how to design beautiful and accessible link focus states in this tutorial by Ethan Marcotte.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tAda Rose Cannon shares how we can animate DOM changes in JavaScript.\n\tIf we want to look for a specific index in JavaScript we don’t need to use any complex loop with a stop anymore but instead can use Array.prototype.findIndex() which returns the index of the first match of our testing function.\n\tWenson Hsieh shares how to use the Async Clipboard API and the differences and advantages over the methods we used in the past.\n\tiOS Safari 13.4+ allows us to block back and forward navigation gestures. This is very useful for media galleries and image croppers where users interact with elements on the side of the viewport and most likely don’t want to navigate to another page, as Rik Schennink explains.\n\tFluor.js is a cool small library that lets us animate a lot of details on websites. Quite nice!\n\nCSS\n\n\tChris Coyier shares how we can use the new shiny CSS property aspect-ratio in our layouts and with that finally replace various hacks we used to use for over a decade now.\n\tLea Verou with a guide on CSS Variables that handles the basic concepts and real practical use cases.\n\tBram Van Damme shares how to use CSS Grid layout Level 2 to create a Masonry layout.\n\tSara Soueidan on how she uses global and component style settings with CSS Custom Properties.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tAfter a month of trial, the Buffer team now is moving entirely to a 4-day work week as the results of significantly reduced stress, higher autonomy, and higher work happiness, more motivation, better collaboration while productivity surprisingly didn’t suffer.\n\tWhy it’s important to connect productivity with our purpose to make it essential and meaningful productivity. Because what doesn’t serve the mission is burning ourselves out which happens if we just strive for more productivity when it doesn’t serve our own deepest mission.\n\tFinally, there’s a resource to find ethical job sites for freelancers instead of ending up on sites that try to exploit us.\n\tLucas Miller is neuroscientist and he sees Slack as a particularly “scary offender” in stopping people getting their work done because it encourages them to be constantly distracted. Of course that isn’t only about Slack but about all the messenger style chat systems we use — no matter if made by an independent company, Microsoft, Facebook or any other.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tIf we frame our own life a little bit different, in evolutionary context, everything we do, everything we see as given or as inherited by our parents can be seen a bit different. We’re then only a small dot in evolution and yet, we are the only ones who can still decide whether the human species will continue to be part of evolution on our planet or not. Evolution is a quite simple concept.\n\tLet’s try to understand why biodiversity is collapsing worldwide at the moment. It means that less species of animals are around in our ecosystem and climate change is fueling it while our agriculture is actively killing the living ground and plants these species need to live. Weirdly, we fail to understand that we won’t get any food, wood and other things that are vital to our health and ability to live if there is no biodiversity anymore. Technology won’t save us in that case, it can only help understand the issue and maybe help improve the situation but the major impact is how we act, what we buy and how we farm.\n\tWe are facing one of the biggest decisions of humankind — a decision on how to face the climate crisis. This is a huge responsibility and at the same time an opportunity. Our chance to work together to initiate a comprehensive change towards a more just society. Here’s the Grassroots Climate Plan with a solid plan what we need and can do to change the current state of burning down our own habitat.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "title": "WDRL — Edition 282: Welcome back again, the web has changed, work as well.",
      "summary": "Hey,\n\nHello my fellow readers! After months of silence I’m back. Since my last update in February a lot has changed, not only in my life but in everyones’. A virus makes us living differently than we are  used to and work has changed with it. A lot of people work from home these days, others lost their jobs and many are facing a change of rules in any part of life. Kids can’t go to school, vacation is not allowed for a specific time or in other cases is enforced to use during the calm times.\nFor myself, my life changed quite a bit in March and April. I started with a new field to grow vegetables nearby in March and it keeps me busy for most of the week right now. It’s a CSA and we can already give ten families including our own nearly enough vegetables for the week with the amount growing every week. In April, my son was born, right in the middle of a weird time that enabled us to welcome him calm and easy to our world.\nThe Web… where to start? For me, now just watching from outside as I laid down all my jobs during the past months to enjoy family time and do the garden, it felt weird to read about all the technological changes during a virus that changes the lives of many people. On the other hand, life goes on, work goes on, and it’s great to see that some people continue to build amazing things, to make better browsers, to invent technologies and services that help all the other people out there struggling right now.\nOur own species to me remains a mystery: While during the crisis and lockdowns, we achieved to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, this quickly goes back or even worse since we “recover” from the lockdowns. I lost my hope that people will fly less now for private and business purposes and may rethink their lives and get on a more sustainable track. I read a lot about how to prevent getting sick, how to stay sane during this heavy, exhausting times and it’s all about your inner peace, about health and about happiness. Many solutions how to achieve it are going outside right where you are, meditate, get rid of stuff you don’t use or need. Most people in my country know less about cities and villages or areas in their own country than in Italy or France or even more abroad. Why is it still not cool to go on vacation in your own country or neighbour country? It takes you only 1 – 3 hours by train instead of a flight that takes 16 hours just to enjoy another beach that’s no different to what you could visit also with a 2 – 3 hours flight. We all watch nature and outdoor adventure documentaries on Netflix but we don’t do it ourselves. I’ve never been truly happier at work than in the past months being outdoors on my field every day, no matter which weather. My back does not hurt anymore, I’m less stressed out and overall way happier. I don’t earn a lot of money right now and we all know that earning money with growing  vegetables by hand and with love doesn’t pay a lot of bills. But I decided now that it just needs to pay my bills. I’ll continue to be a freelance developer to earn a baseline of money but splitting my work into two jobs was by far the best I could do for myself lately.\nAs always, my thoughts are thought as a trigger to you. Disregard it if you don’t want to think about it or don’t have the time right now. Reply to me if you think you want to say something or have a question. Share it, if you think you know someone who would benefit from it or write your own thoughts to the public if you think they’ll benefit others.\nNews\n\n\tUhm, so there’s Firefox 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77 out since my last update. The most important news are: Better WebRTC privacy protections, faster search bar, locally cached trusted Web PKI Certificate Authority certificates, support for the loading attribute on img elements, Picture-in-picture support, Audio Worklet support, and support for the JavaScript API String.prototype.replaceAll().\n\tWebKit in the meanwhile introduced Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking to improve privacy for users. Quite a big change although we could see it coming.\n\tChrome 80, 81, 83 now supports Module Workers, optional chaining in JavaScript, trusted types, new default form styles, support for the native file system API, and new cross-origin policies.\n\tSafari 13.1 adds support for the Web Animation API, Async Clipboard API, JavaScript replaceAll, nullish coalesing operator, ResizeObserver, the enterkeyhint attribute for form inputs, Picture-in-Picture API, and the RemotePlayback API.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tJosé Manrique López de la Fuente on Ethics and Open Source Software Development. The plea for an ethical license for copyleft comes up again.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAlex Holachek shares her experiences on how to make form inputs better for mobile users by choosing the right input types, attributes, validators.\n\t“It is not uncommon that I raise an accessibility or usability issue with a client’s design or implementation and am met with either ‘But Google does this,’ or ‘But Apple does this.’” Adrian Roselli in a revealing, open statement on why we really shouldn’t care about what the big companies do because they don’t know either.\n\nTooling\n\n\tTobias Tom shares how to use bash operators effectively and shows that there’s more than just the && operator.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tdeSEC is a free and secure DNS hosting running on open source software and sounds pretty cool. It even has an anycast so it’s fast around the world while offering more security than most other services that you pay for.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tTim Kadlec on building web solutions with friction and why he loves the concept of Bundlephobia, a tool that warns you about your JavaScript bundle size.\n\tDanny van Kooten is the author of a very common Wordpress plugin. He made some simple changes and with it saved probably about 59000kg of CO2, all by removing a 20kb JavaScript dependency. There’s little chance you can similarly easy cut your personal emissions so this gives us a clue how important it is to not be careless about what we do on the web.\n\tHow fast is PHP 8 going to be? Although there are only prereleases available yet, it’s probably a lot faster than version 7.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere are the Standards for Writing Code Accessibly.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tArrays, arrays, arrays, one of the most common things we use in programming languages. Here’s Rebecca Uranga explaining the most common modern JavaScript Array methods and when to use which one.\n\tArrow functions are handy but they’re also not very great when we need to debug them. But Dmitri Pavlutin shares how to write better arrow functions.\n\nCSS\n\n\tJhey Tompkins shows us how we can create a responsive CSS Motion Path.\n\tDiagonal layouts are pretty common in the past years, but they often were hacked together quite ugly to achieve the look. However, in 2020 we can do it quite nicely with modern CSS techniques and Nils Binder shares how.\n\tSometimes the specification is the best documentation. Inside the CSS Values and Units Module Level 4 you can learn about the min(), max() but more importantly about the clamp() function in CSS that allows you to e.g. force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px by stating: font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px); All we ever wanted for fonts, right?\n\tOh, what if we could style form inputs nicely and with simple CSS? Aaron Iker shares how we can do it.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThis news made me very unhappy. It’s one of the main reasons I chose to change my profession, to do something actively against climate change, to become a climate farmer: “One in five children have had nightmares about climate change while more than half do not think they are being listened to on the subject, a survey has found”. It’s upon us, parents, uncles/aunts, and friends of parents to fix this problem, so that these kids don’t need to suffer from bad dreams.\n\tLeo Babauta on the heartbreaking effects of being only partly committed to most things.\n\t“When you bought your first smartphone, did you know you would spend more than 1,000 hours a year looking at it? […] If we wasted money the way we waste time, we’d all be bankrupt.” — Seth Godin\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tEricsson gives us a “quick guide” to our digital carbon footprint that shows our impact of using all the online services. And while the subtitle says it’s little, it also reveals that there’s potential to reduce the impact by 80 percent if providers would use greener energy and infrastructure.\n\tSo who would think about farming when we’re talking about air quality and clean air? Well, it seems that California’s regulations help farms produce more food since the trees’ photosynthesis is more efficient when there’s less ground ozone.\n\tHow does climate change impact Europe? Because common news mostly include other areas in the world, we know little about it. But this great interactive maps model shows the change of weather in a simple way. Heavy rains, forest fires, agricultural issues, draughts will all become more serious and more frequent, it seems.\n\tAs a company you can stand up and protect your clients, you can be political. See the example of Basecamp who now deny to offer their products to employee-surveillance products and services.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better. The next edition will hopefully be served to your inboxes way sooner again and I already have a couple of thoughts and links in the queue.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nHello my fellow readers! After months of silence I’m back. Since my last update in February a lot has changed, not only in my life but in everyones’. A virus makes us living differently than we are  used to and work has changed with it. A lot of people work from home these days, others lost their jobs and many are facing a change of rules in any part of life. Kids can’t go to school, vacation is not allowed for a specific time or in other cases is enforced to use during the calm times.\nFor myself, my life changed quite a bit in March and April. I started with a new field to grow vegetables nearby in March and it keeps me busy for most of the week right now. It’s a CSA and we can already give ten families including our own nearly enough vegetables for the week with the amount growing every week. In April, my son was born, right in the middle of a weird time that enabled us to welcome him calm and easy to our world.\nThe Web… where to start? For me, now just watching from outside as I laid down all my jobs during the past months to enjoy family time and do the garden, it felt weird to read about all the technological changes during a virus that changes the lives of many people. On the other hand, life goes on, work goes on, and it’s great to see that some people continue to build amazing things, to make better browsers, to invent technologies and services that help all the other people out there struggling right now.\nOur own species to me remains a mystery: While during the crisis and lockdowns, we achieved to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, this quickly goes back or even worse since we “recover” from the lockdowns. I lost my hope that people will fly less now for private and business purposes and may rethink their lives and get on a more sustainable track. I read a lot about how to prevent getting sick, how to stay sane during this heavy, exhausting times and it’s all about your inner peace, about health and about happiness. Many solutions how to achieve it are going outside right where you are, meditate, get rid of stuff you don’t use or need. Most people in my country know less about cities and villages or areas in their own country than in Italy or France or even more abroad. Why is it still not cool to go on vacation in your own country or neighbour country? It takes you only 1 – 3 hours by train instead of a flight that takes 16 hours just to enjoy another beach that’s no different to what you could visit also with a 2 – 3 hours flight. We all watch nature and outdoor adventure documentaries on Netflix but we don’t do it ourselves. I’ve never been truly happier at work than in the past months being outdoors on my field every day, no matter which weather. My back does not hurt anymore, I’m less stressed out and overall way happier. I don’t earn a lot of money right now and we all know that earning money with growing  vegetables by hand and with love doesn’t pay a lot of bills. But I decided now that it just needs to pay my bills. I’ll continue to be a freelance developer to earn a baseline of money but splitting my work into two jobs was by far the best I could do for myself lately.\nAs always, my thoughts are thought as a trigger to you. Disregard it if you don’t want to think about it or don’t have the time right now. Reply to me if you think you want to say something or have a question. Share it, if you think you know someone who would benefit from it or write your own thoughts to the public if you think they’ll benefit others.\nNews\n\n\tUhm, so there’s Firefox 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77 out since my last update. The most important news are: Better WebRTC privacy protections, faster search bar, locally cached trusted Web PKI Certificate Authority certificates, support for the loading attribute on img elements, Picture-in-picture support, Audio Worklet support, and support for the JavaScript API String.prototype.replaceAll().\n\tWebKit in the meanwhile introduced Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking to improve privacy for users. Quite a big change although we could see it coming.\n\tChrome 80, 81, 83 now supports Module Workers, optional chaining in JavaScript, trusted types, new default form styles, support for the native file system API, and new cross-origin policies.\n\tSafari 13.1 adds support for the Web Animation API, Async Clipboard API, JavaScript replaceAll, nullish coalesing operator, ResizeObserver, the enterkeyhint attribute for form inputs, Picture-in-Picture API, and the RemotePlayback API.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tJosé Manrique López de la Fuente on Ethics and Open Source Software Development. The plea for an ethical license for copyleft comes up again.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tAlex Holachek shares her experiences on how to make form inputs better for mobile users by choosing the right input types, attributes, validators.\n\t“It is not uncommon that I raise an accessibility or usability issue with a client’s design or implementation and am met with either ‘But Google does this,’ or ‘But Apple does this.’” Adrian Roselli in a revealing, open statement on why we really shouldn’t care about what the big companies do because they don’t know either.\n\nTooling\n\n\tTobias Tom shares how to use bash operators effectively and shows that there’s more than just the && operator.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tdeSEC is a free and secure DNS hosting running on open source software and sounds pretty cool. It even has an anycast so it’s fast around the world while offering more security than most other services that you pay for.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tTim Kadlec on building web solutions with friction and why he loves the concept of Bundlephobia, a tool that warns you about your JavaScript bundle size.\n\tDanny van Kooten is the author of a very common Wordpress plugin. He made some simple changes and with it saved probably about 59000kg of CO2, all by removing a 20kb JavaScript dependency. There’s little chance you can similarly easy cut your personal emissions so this gives us a clue how important it is to not be careless about what we do on the web.\n\tHow fast is PHP 8 going to be? Although there are only prereleases available yet, it’s probably a lot faster than version 7.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tHere are the Standards for Writing Code Accessibly.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tArrays, arrays, arrays, one of the most common things we use in programming languages. Here’s Rebecca Uranga explaining the most common modern JavaScript Array methods and when to use which one.\n\tArrow functions are handy but they’re also not very great when we need to debug them. But Dmitri Pavlutin shares how to write better arrow functions.\n\nCSS\n\n\tJhey Tompkins shows us how we can create a responsive CSS Motion Path.\n\tDiagonal layouts are pretty common in the past years, but they often were hacked together quite ugly to achieve the look. However, in 2020 we can do it quite nicely with modern CSS techniques and Nils Binder shares how.\n\tSometimes the specification is the best documentation. Inside the CSS Values and Units Module Level 4 you can learn about the min(), max() but more importantly about the clamp() function in CSS that allows you to e.g. force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px by stating: font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px); All we ever wanted for fonts, right?\n\tOh, what if we could style form inputs nicely and with simple CSS? Aaron Iker shares how we can do it.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tThis news made me very unhappy. It’s one of the main reasons I chose to change my profession, to do something actively against climate change, to become a climate farmer: “One in five children have had nightmares about climate change while more than half do not think they are being listened to on the subject, a survey has found”. It’s upon us, parents, uncles/aunts, and friends of parents to fix this problem, so that these kids don’t need to suffer from bad dreams.\n\tLeo Babauta on the heartbreaking effects of being only partly committed to most things.\n\t“When you bought your first smartphone, did you know you would spend more than 1,000 hours a year looking at it? […] If we wasted money the way we waste time, we’d all be bankrupt.” — Seth Godin\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tEricsson gives us a “quick guide” to our digital carbon footprint that shows our impact of using all the online services. And while the subtitle says it’s little, it also reveals that there’s potential to reduce the impact by 80 percent if providers would use greener energy and infrastructure.\n\tSo who would think about farming when we’re talking about air quality and clean air? Well, it seems that California’s regulations help farms produce more food since the trees’ photosynthesis is more efficient when there’s less ground ozone.\n\tHow does climate change impact Europe? Because common news mostly include other areas in the world, we know little about it. But this great interactive maps model shows the change of weather in a simple way. Heavy rains, forest fires, agricultural issues, draughts will all become more serious and more frequent, it seems.\n\tAs a company you can stand up and protect your clients, you can be political. See the example of Basecamp who now deny to offer their products to employee-surveillance products and services.\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, I hope you’re doing fine and stay positive, find your way to make an impact and help build a better society, better friendships and make our world a little better. The next edition will hopefully be served to your inboxes way sooner again and I already have a couple of thoughts and links in the queue.\nIf you want to support my work, you can give back via PayPal or Stripe.

We tend to continue doing not something different because we have too much on our plates, we are too distracted. We don’t have time to focus on what we really want to do, focus on what we want to change, focus on helping other people or focus on self-care.\nIn 2020 I opened a Community Supported Agriculture to provide local, naturally grown and healthy food to people nearby. No need for them to buy it in the supermarket where it was transported many hundred kilometers through the country and isn’t fresh anymore. My action to foster local community, to do something for the better, for the climate, for other people with a real impact.\nI will also take three months of parental leave time for my family (my wife and soon my newborn child) and for myself, to get focus on the things that are in my mind but never find time to think properly about. This means no work, no WDRL, no other developer related stuff during that time so an entirely different lifestyle for a limited time. Let’s see what this brings.\nNews\n\n\tPHP 7.4 is the latest version but v8 is in the works and Brent shares what’s new in PHP 8: We’ll likely get Union types, a Just in time compiler, a static return type, weak maps, ::class on objects as easier form of writing get_class(), it lets us create DateTime objects from an interface, and some more. What’s changing?

It lazy loads, has a dave data option, produces no reflow, and has no dependencies.\n\tPhilip Walton shares how we can serve way smaller HTML payloads in applications by using Service Workers for them.\n\nCSS\n\n\tIt’s interesting to see where we started with CSS over twenty years ago and where we are now. I myself built my first website in 2001 with Framesets and inline CSS and HTML 4 style attributes. Quickly after, I learned a bit how to use tables to create layouts (Photoshop could write most of the code, huh!) but gladly this didn’t take long until we had CSS2.1 which allowed us to create way better and more semantic layouts.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEnough is enough. But what’s enough? Having less stuff (aka “minimalism”) can’t be successful for us long-term, it can only serve as a path to sufficiency and satisfaction.

It’s the first step to identify these points and then take care that not too many in parallel are true for our lives.\n\tA new guide 'With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility' arrives during a period of backlash on campuses, where tech companies like Amazon and Palantir recruit. It’s by Mozilla and it wants young people to consider ‘Ethical Issues’ before taking jobs in tech. It’s on healthy work places, healthy company and startup culture, working on real problems in the world and not causing any harm with our work we do.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tHow your clothes become microfibre pollution in the sea. We buy plastic fibre clothes, wash them and the plastic is slowly dissolving into microplastic in the washing mashine and the sewage treatment plants can’t filter it so it gets into the rivers which end up in the sea.\n\tParis, France, 2020: The mayor announces that they plan to make the city fully cyclist friendly in the next four years. But what does it mean and how will the city change? It’s a great plan that ensures cycling is )the most efficient way to navigate from A to B.\n\tSimon Weckert is an artist and he has a fun project where he hacks Google’s traffic jam algorithm by walking on empty streets with a dozen phones using Google Maps directions. The result? More empty streets because Google reroutes other cars to avoid the jam.\n\tThe open climate science group has analyzed the past 2k years and this shows the development of global temperature in a visual way between year 1 and 2019 AD. It’s super interesting to see that how unusual the current period of the past 150–200 years is in terms of our planet’s climate. See, humans exists since way longer than 1AD so this visualization also shows us where the solution to fix climate change would be. We have to look back and adapt our lifestyle a bit. Local, following the year rythm, slower, and happier.\n\n\nFinally, let me recommend you the printed books of Cabins that are simple and serve the one purpose we all strive for: A space that spellbind us in its warmth and ingenious simplicity.\nIf you want to support produce WDRL, contribute via PayPal or Stripe.

It lazy loads, has a dave data option, produces no reflow, and has no dependencies.\n\tPhilip Walton shares how we can serve way smaller HTML payloads in applications by using Service Workers for them.\n\nCSS\n\n\tIt’s interesting to see where we started with CSS over twenty years ago and where we are now. I myself built my first website in 2001 with Framesets and inline CSS and HTML 4 style attributes. Quickly after, I learned a bit how to use tables to create layouts (Photoshop could write most of the code, huh!) but gladly this didn’t take long until we had CSS2.1 which allowed us to create way better and more semantic layouts.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tEnough is enough. But what’s enough? Having less stuff (aka “minimalism”) can’t be successful for us long-term, it can only serve as a path to sufficiency and satisfaction. The goal needs to be that we solve enough for us, that we realize and incorporate that we don’t need more, that we have enough.\n\tFrank Chimero with a list of things that foster burnout: Our achievement culture, hyperactive comparison, isolation, the lack of work ethics, unnecessary self-improvement thoughts, and a couple more. It’s the first step to identify these points and then take care that not too many in parallel are true for our lives.\n\tA new guide 'With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility' arrives during a period of backlash on campuses, where tech companies like Amazon and Palantir recruit. It’s by Mozilla and it wants young people to consider ‘Ethical Issues’ before taking jobs in tech. It’s on healthy work places, healthy company and startup culture, working on real problems in the world and not causing any harm with our work we do.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tHow your clothes become microfibre pollution in the sea. We buy plastic fibre clothes, wash them and the plastic is slowly dissolving into microplastic in the washing mashine and the sewage treatment plants can’t filter it so it gets into the rivers which end up in the sea.\n\tParis, France, 2020: The mayor announces that they plan to make the city fully cyclist friendly in the next four years. But what does it mean and how will the city change? It’s a great plan that ensures cycling is )the most efficient way to navigate from A to B.\n\tSimon Weckert is an artist and he has a fun project where he hacks Google’s traffic jam algorithm by walking on empty streets with a dozen phones using Google Maps directions. The result? More empty streets because Google reroutes other cars to avoid the jam.\n\tThe open climate science group has analyzed the past 2k years and this shows the development of global temperature in a visual way between year 1 and 2019 AD. It’s super interesting to see that how unusual the current period of the past 150–200 years is in terms of our planet’s climate. See, humans exists since way longer than 1AD so this visualization also shows us where the solution to fix climate change would be. We have to look back and adapt our lifestyle a bit. Local, following the year rythm, slower, and happier.\n\n\nFinally, let me recommend you the printed books of Cabins that are simple and serve the one purpose we all strive for: A space that spellbind us in its warmth and ingenious simplicity.\nIf you want to support produce WDRL, contribute via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nIt’s the last update for this year as the new year holidays are coming up and I’m gonna take a break from web development as well during this time. Time to work on other things like woodwork, or preparing and planning the next year’s Gardening season. I’m going to build a CSA and next year will be the preparation and experimentation season before going into full production for other people so they can enjoy local, fresh and carefully grown food at a reasonable price.\nThe end of the year is typically the time where everyone asks about new year goals. Well, whether you have goals or not, we can definitely care more about how we treat other people, whether they’re co-workers, our managers or clients. If we show empathy and try to be helpful instead of arrogant, we not only build a better product but also build a network of trust, a network of reliable people that we can count on when we need help. In times where everything happens in virtual worlds, it’s more and more important to not be just any brand out there but one that stands out because they are personal and kind. If you have any feedback on how I can do better with this newsletter or Colloq, write me an email. And if you know great examples that stood out for you, let me know as well e.g. on Mastodon or Twitter.\nNews\n\n\tChrome 79 is out and brings maskable icons on Android PWAs, the WebXR Device API, and an origin trial of a “Wake Lock API”. In the DevTools, you can now see why a cookie was blocked, emulate CSS media queries like prefers-reduced-motion or prefers-color-scheme.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tBPF: A New Type of Software. These are interesting softwares as they don’t show up as nomal processes or kernel modules. They introduce a new interface for applications to make kernel requests, alongside syscalls and is a super interesting change in how operating systems work with software.\n\tIt seems that Jeff Bezos grandfather once said to him “one day you’ll understand that it’s harder to be kind than clever.” And this is very true, if you think about all the clever technologies and products out there. Most of them are not showing any sort of kindness to other people and we still have a hard time coming up with a list of companies that we would define as “kind” to us customers.\n\tColin Bendell explores the world of “microbrowsers”, these little link preview widgets appearing in messaging services like Slack, Messages, Whatsapp, Signal and shows how we can optimise the content of the previews with simple tools.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\tThese days it’s hard to prevent tracking. Even for the big players like the WebKit team, as they point out in their article Preventing Tracking Prevention Tracking.\n\tHow small design changes rewrote the rules of messaging and how we feel about one another, says Adrian Zumbrunnen and shows us how this happened over the past two decades at the example of ICQ, one of the earliest instant messengers.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tInstant Page is a JavaScript that tries to predict really well whether a user will click on a link or not, and, based on that, will prefetch and preload the linked page in the browser for improved performance.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tPaul Grenier writes about how we can and why we should care more about writing good docs. Automating inclusive documentation shows tools and services helping us achieve that.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tMichelle Barker shares how we can easily animate and create beautiful scrolling experiences with a few lines of JavaScript combined with CSS Scroll Snap Points.\n\tPaul Irish has published a new mini library that provides a super fast YouTube embed for your page using custom elements.\n\tErik Terwan wrote a small library that lets a page react to scroll changes called ScrollTrigger.\n\nCSS\n\n\tStas Melnikov shares how to use auto margin values in Flexbox layout.\n\tHolger Bartel shows us with a simple and practical example of why the new CSS :is() pseudo selector can be very handy and shorten our selector code massively.\n\tBryan Robinson on how we can lay out full with content sections in an article layout using CSS Subgrid, something that we always needed ugly hacks for so far.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tStructure does not bring you happiness is a piece of text on how important effectiveness and structure at work are. But keeping in mind that this won’t bring you happiness and adapting your work and lifestyle accordingly is even more important to being a happy person.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tAluminium is heavily used today almost in any sector of products. But it’s not problem-free and it’s amazing to see that Apple just bought the first batch of carbon-free aluminium. This makes hopes for less resource-heavy products soon.\n\tThe world’s forests are being carved into pieces—but why is this a problem? Well, animals are likely to pay a heavy price, so we should try to reduce the fragmentation and combine forests again instead of splitting them up further.\n\n\nIf you want to support produce WDRL, contribute via PayPal or Stripe.

      "summary": "Hey,\n\nIt’s interesting to reflect on our own behaviour: We can often enough catch ourselves complaining or ranting about other people—some of them we know personally, some we don’t. I’m currently reading a (German) book that’s written mostly for farmers but I can’t stop thinking it should be read by anyone, especially non-farmers. Of course it tackles our climate, but more importantly, it points out how we end up in the situation of fueling climate change. It reveals how our social behaviour is broken once we are not in direct contact with people anymore. It’s relatively easy for us to thank beloved ones or a craftsman showing up at your house to repair something, but it’s hard to show the same appreciation to those who grow our coffee, to those who make our shirts and jeans.\nIt’s hard for us to feel empathy with people in the news, with famous people while it’s easy to complain about them or be envious. But what if we try to show empathy? Maybe they grew into their role and don’t even like all the show business or attention from media. What if we try to see them as part of our society and while their influence may seem bigger than our own, it’s upon us to influence the world around us, not the media’s. We can choose whether to watch TV and do nothing but complain about how bad everything is or take some action, self-reflected, with our friends, neighbours, maybe with strangers who feel the same. \nIt’s our choice whether we declutter our flat, whether to consume cheap meat, whether to be annoyed by the climate news, or whether we use our common sense and try to help other people, other animals, other plants, trees and in the end ourselves by showing gratitude, appreciation and creating a social, helpful community again. It doesn’t matter where it starts—it can be online, at work, with your clients, while shopping groceries, at home with your friends, children or neighbours.\nNews\n\n\tFirefox 71 is out and brings Picture in Picture playing mode, more CSS Grid Level 2 features, the column-span property, the JavaScript Promise.allSettled() method, a partial support for the Media Session API. The developer tools now include Network request blocking, a Console multi-line editor mode, network full-text search, a WebSocket message inspector, and logging on Event Listeners.\n\tPHP 7.4 has been released and brings typed properties, arrow functions, limited return type covariance and argument type contravariance, unpacking inside arrays, numeric literal separator, allows exceptions from __toString(), and removes some more extensions from the core.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tMel Choyce on why machines and algorithms aren’t neutral, why we as developers, as people working in and with tech should embrace being political instead of trying to deny the truth. We can choose what to do; We can create different algorithms.\n\nTooling\n\n\tIre Aderinokun shares how she created a Puppeteer script that creates automated screenshots as fallbacks for embed widgets from a webpage, automatically hosted on Cloudinary.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tThere are dozens of adblockers and tracking blockers on our computers these days, some even built into the browsers. But we still see tracking in some places, one of them by Eulerian, a leading tracking company. How did they do that? They found a way to use a technique called CNAME Cloaking and trick customers into adopting these privacy-invading, scary DNS hacking practices. With that, it becomes more and more important to change your default DNS provider to one that tries to protect your privacy, like 1.1.1.1 by Cloudflare or NextDNS, or your own pi-hole at home running on a RaspberryPi for free.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\t63% of surveyed developers don’t test for accessibility of their work, it seems. Bruce Lawson reacted and created a 4-minutes business case of testing and solving the biggest accessibility issues. Our turn now.\n\tHeydon Pickering’s new book “Inclusive Components” is here. It has guides how to build better modals, tabbed interfaces, collapsible sections, cards, tooltips, or toggle features.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tUnconventional to read about that topic from a developer point of view but that makes it so great as resources on it are so rare: Christian Schäfer wrote a blog post on how to deal with ads in 2020. This is about what still sucks about ads, but as more than enough sites rely on them we need a solid concept to integrate it with the least impact on users possible. A lesson on the <xmp> element, lazy loading via Intersection Observer API, creating Contextual Fragments, combined with the connection information from the browser results in ads on sites that most of us would maybe even love but at least not be annoyed of.\n\tWe all use Custom Select elements. But most of them are less than optimal when it comes to UX or accessibility. Julie Grundy shares her approach of making a better custom select element.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAn interesting rundown by Dylan Paulus on how Facebook ensures their ads are shown to the users, regardless which ad blockers they use. They use splitting legally required text into single character span elements as data-attributes.\n\tBri Camp Gomez on who we can create overlapping images in CSS with CSS Grid and without all the hassle we had with such layouts in the past.\n\tThomas Steiner on how we can implement prefers-color-scheme in SVG favicons to achieve dark mode icons via inline CSS Media Queries in the SVG.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tIt’s not entirely new and has been suspected and shared in the news already that there’s a huge addiction to the smartphone and it affects our health. But this clinical study on young people reveals alarming results: Every fourth child (or young people) faces Problematic Smarthone Use, a diagnosis that indicates addiction to the phone accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health.\n\tThe path to mastery is available to all of us. With enough effort and persistence, achieving greatness in a chosen field is within reach. We can capture genius and direct our focus and attention to a singular aim that brings both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Today it’s just an uncommon, almost forgotten path to go inside our fast-paced, throw-away society but that doesn’t make it less worthy to follow, quite the contrary.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tOn ethics in our society by the one who played Ali G, Borat and Admiral General Aladeen. Sacha Baron Cohen with an important message on the social media giants, namely here Facebook: Facebook would have let Hitler buy ads for 'final solution'. And it’s not deniable but instead, totally reconstructable for each of us and we’ve seen the principle happening in the past years during elections.\n\tWe knew that microplastics—the tiny pieces of broken-down plastic bottles and other garbage—can now be found everywhere from Arctic ice to bottled water to seafood. But scientists figured out in new studies that there are a million times more microplastics in the ocean than we thought until now.\n\n\nIf you want to support produce WDRL, contribute via PayPal or Stripe.

      "content_text": "Hey,\n\nIt’s interesting to reflect on our own behaviour: We can often enough catch ourselves complaining or ranting about other people—some of them we know personally, some we don’t. I’m currently reading a (German) book that’s written mostly for farmers but I can’t stop thinking it should be read by anyone, especially non-farmers. Of course it tackles our climate, but more importantly, it points out how we end up in the situation of fueling climate change. It reveals how our social behaviour is broken once we are not in direct contact with people anymore. It’s relatively easy for us to thank beloved ones or a craftsman showing up at your house to repair something, but it’s hard to show the same appreciation to those who grow our coffee, to those who make our shirts and jeans.\nIt’s hard for us to feel empathy with people in the news, with famous people while it’s easy to complain about them or be envious. But what if we try to show empathy? Maybe they grew into their role and don’t even like all the show business or attention from media. What if we try to see them as part of our society and while their influence may seem bigger than our own, it’s upon us to influence the world around us, not the media’s. We can choose whether to watch TV and do nothing but complain about how bad everything is or take some action, self-reflected, with our friends, neighbours, maybe with strangers who feel the same. \nIt’s our choice whether we declutter our flat, whether to consume cheap meat, whether to be annoyed by the climate news, or whether we use our common sense and try to help other people, other animals, other plants, trees and in the end ourselves by showing gratitude, appreciation and creating a social, helpful community again. It doesn’t matter where it starts—it can be online, at work, with your clients, while shopping groceries, at home with your friends, children or neighbours.\nNews\n\n\tFirefox 71 is out and brings Picture in Picture playing mode, more CSS Grid Level 2 features, the column-span property, the JavaScript Promise.allSettled() method, a partial support for the Media Session API. The developer tools now include Network request blocking, a Console multi-line editor mode, network full-text search, a WebSocket message inspector, and logging on Event Listeners.\n\tPHP 7.4 has been released and brings typed properties, arrow functions, limited return type covariance and argument type contravariance, unpacking inside arrays, numeric literal separator, allows exceptions from __toString(), and removes some more extensions from the core.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tMel Choyce on why machines and algorithms aren’t neutral, why we as developers, as people working in and with tech should embrace being political instead of trying to deny the truth. We can choose what to do; We can create different algorithms.\n\nTooling\n\n\tIre Aderinokun shares how she created a Puppeteer script that creates automated screenshots as fallbacks for embed widgets from a webpage, automatically hosted on Cloudinary.\n\nSecurity\n\n\tThere are dozens of adblockers and tracking blockers on our computers these days, some even built into the browsers. But we still see tracking in some places, one of them by Eulerian, a leading tracking company. How did they do that? They found a way to use a technique called CNAME Cloaking and trick customers into adopting these privacy-invading, scary DNS hacking practices. With that, it becomes more and more important to change your default DNS provider to one that tries to protect your privacy, like 1.1.1.1 by Cloudflare or NextDNS, or your own pi-hole at home running on a RaspberryPi for free.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\t63% of surveyed developers don’t test for accessibility of their work, it seems. Bruce Lawson reacted and created a 4-minutes business case of testing and solving the biggest accessibility issues. Our turn now.\n\tHeydon Pickering’s new book “Inclusive Components” is here. It has guides how to build better modals, tabbed interfaces, collapsible sections, cards, tooltips, or toggle features.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tUnconventional to read about that topic from a developer point of view but that makes it so great as resources on it are so rare: Christian Schäfer wrote a blog post on how to deal with ads in 2020. This is about what still sucks about ads, but as more than enough sites rely on them we need a solid concept to integrate it with the least impact on users possible. A lesson on the <xmp> element, lazy loading via Intersection Observer API, creating Contextual Fragments, combined with the connection information from the browser results in ads on sites that most of us would maybe even love but at least not be annoyed of.\n\tWe all use Custom Select elements. But most of them are less than optimal when it comes to UX or accessibility. Julie Grundy shares her approach of making a better custom select element.\n\nCSS\n\n\tAn interesting rundown by Dylan Paulus on how Facebook ensures their ads are shown to the users, regardless which ad blockers they use. They use splitting legally required text into single character span elements as data-attributes.\n\tBri Camp Gomez on who we can create overlapping images in CSS with CSS Grid and without all the hassle we had with such layouts in the past.\n\tThomas Steiner on how we can implement prefers-color-scheme in SVG favicons to achieve dark mode icons via inline CSS Media Queries in the SVG.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\tIt’s not entirely new and has been suspected and shared in the news already that there’s a huge addiction to the smartphone and it affects our health. But this clinical study on young people reveals alarming results: Every fourth child (or young people) faces Problematic Smarthone Use, a diagnosis that indicates addiction to the phone accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health.\n\tThe path to mastery is available to all of us. With enough effort and persistence, achieving greatness in a chosen field is within reach. We can capture genius and direct our focus and attention to a singular aim that brings both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Today it’s just an uncommon, almost forgotten path to go inside our fast-paced, throw-away society but that doesn’t make it less worthy to follow, quite the contrary.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tOn ethics in our society by the one who played Ali G, Borat and Admiral General Aladeen.

      "title": "WDRL — Edition 276: Back again and here’s how we can be a better self and do a good job",
      "summary": "Hey,\n\nSometimes a break is needed but you don’t notice. With the last WDRL edition on SmashingMag in September, this was apparently the case for me with this project. First, I wanted to pause for two weeks but it turned easily into over a month now. It brought back my motivation to write the summary for you and here is a quite big list with articles I want to recommend to you.\nNews\n\n\tFirefox 70 is out and new is CSS text-decoration-thickness, text-underline-offset, two-keyword display values like display: block flex; to allow outer and inner box settings, numeric separators in JavaScript, Intl improvements. You can now also use % in opacity property values.\n\tIn the meantime, Chrome 77 and 78 have been released and bring the Largest Contentful Paint API, the formdata event as well as Form-associated custom elements, native lazy loading via the loading=\"lazy\" attribute,  a new Contact Picker API, and the CSS Properties and Values API.\n\nGeneric\n\n\tEthan Marcotte’s talk “The World-Wide Work” is important to read and or watch for all of us. The importance of small little details and their impact on accessibility, or the society, the power of design in our world and how the web plays a role in here, too.\n\tItamar Turner-Trauring shares great tips on What can a software developer do about climate change? and yes, it’s providing background and suggesting very useful, practicable actions that everyone of us can do. Not one of those generic, unrealistic posts but really down to the point.\n\nUI/UX\n\n\tWhy is it important to have an opinion and share your values as a brand? Here’s an evaluation of brands with and without opinions and how they market their product differently.\n\tThe Stripe design team shares how they designed an accessible color system and we can learn a lot from it, not only from accessibility perspective but also to improve the design itself.\n\tAlexis Beingessner shares the problems of text rendering in browsers in his article “Text Rendering Hates You” and why subpixel-rendering and aliasing can cause quite some problems with text.\n\tRecycling is hard and we’re not good at it. Now it seems part of it is the messaging around it and the currently used strategy of demanding people to recycle is not motivating to people. If we’d instead advertise recycling as “giving this product a new life, it could e.g. become a new jacket” this is way more motivating for us to separate and care about where we throw our recyclables. A great lesson of how much it matters how you ask people to do something.\n\tTo be planet-centric, designers need to be diverse and inclusive in their influences and practice. Understanding the colonisation of design education and exploring other ways of knowing will be critical to unlocking more interconnected, systemic design practices.\n\nTooling\n\n\tPatrick Fulton provides a good introduction into the most common visual regresstion testing systems and how we can and should use them in our projects.\n\nWeb Performance\n\n\tJoseph Scott found a Chrome announcement that’s going to change how the browser caches resources, especially those resources coming from CDNs. It’s also a nice little lesson on browser and web security.\n\nAccessibility\n\n\tAn one presentation tries to rule it all about accessibility, and it’s a good and massive one. Easy to understand, we can learn what our common mistakes are as developers and learn how to implement accessibility correctly without any compromises in design.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\tThe most common One Time Password (OTP) method today is via SMS. With the new SMS Receiver API, available in Chrome as Origin trial, brings this verification method to the web. Native apps had the feature of verifying an account via SMS and automatically retrieving the code from the SMS in your app already, and the goal is to make that feature available in the web, too. Note that SMS still is not a very secure method and can be intercepted by a third-party.\n\nCSS\n\n\tCan I email is a great resource to find out which elements and CSS properties and values you can use in email clients…\n\tTobias Ahlin shares how we can create smoother and sharper shadows with layered box-shadows. A very good solution!\n\tYou can use pseudo elements to create cool effects for hover states in CSS.\n\nWork & Life\n\n\t“Don’t throw in the day job to follow your dream”. Join the bifurcators who juggle work-for-pay and their work-for-love.\n\tHow to make life more pleasurable is a reminder how we should try to limit what we consume, what we watch, drink, eat, and how we see sleep in order to make the experience better.\n\tEveryone I know has this problem: there never seems to be enough time in the day for everything we need or want to do. The secret is to work and act with appreciation and focus and this article gives suggestions and hints how we can implement that into our daily work.\n\nGo beyond…\n\n\tThese washing machines try to stop microfibers right before they enter the water ecosystem from our households. IT’s nice to see that there is new traditional household hardware coming up to solve our society’s biggest problems.\n\tDespite the lawsuits and predictions of gridlock, restricting a single Manhattan street to buses has been a success. So why don’t we start from here and take it further to improve our lives and planet?\n\tBig tech isn’t interested in a better world, just a more profitable one. To beat it, we need to break its stranglehold on us. A very insightful piece of writing around how companies fuel and influence politics and our entire economy and world, not always to the better.\n\tTechnology was supposed to bring us together. Instead, it has been tearing us apart. Human relationships are increasingly being replaced with virtual ones. This grassroots project questions this trend, in the the hope that we reconnect again.\n\n\nIf you want to support produce WDRL, contribute via PayPal or Stripe.

When I recently updated my newsletter service server software nearly everything broke into pieces. I was using <a href=\"https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain\">mailtrain v1</a> for a long time now but it’s deprecated and using old node versions. Upgrading to v2 wasn’t easy enough for me and I also wanted to have an easier to maintain mailer anyway. The new email is sent via <a href=\"https://mailcoach.app\">Spatie&rsquo;s Laravel Mailcoach</a>. So far it’s a pretty manual process again since it doesn’t support RSS-campaigns. At some point in future I want to publish the newsletter via <a href=\"https://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a> to the Mailcoach API.</p>\n<p>But at this point I now changed my template as well to a modern <a href=\"https://mjml.io\">MJML based template code</a>. This should hopefully fix all the rendering issues you reported to me recently. I tried to support light and dark mode in the emails but that utterly failed and the new template does not support it, too. It’s a bit sad but mail clients once again do what they believe is right, leading to white on white text in some cases. It’s a good reminder to <a href=\"https://www.caniemail.com\">caniemail</a> and that email templating isn’t coding for a browser.</p>\n<p>Please report any issues to me if you find one. Now enjoy the new content:</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"uuid6\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://uuid6.github.io/uuid6-ietf-draft/\">UUID6-8 will be a standard soon for unique identifiers</a>, solving a lot of the common issues with UUID formats (e.g. UUIDv4).

I always struggle a bit when this is the case because usually it’s about sensitive topics which aren’t easy to discuss in public but this is a <em>personal</em> newsletter. And you can always skip the next paragraph. </p>\n<h4>personal intro</h4>\n<p>When I sent out the last edition, we were in a pandemic. Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts. Things aren’t normal since two years now and I the only way I currently see is people finding an arrangement with their inner self to deal with this. Which isn’t really a solution, more a compromise. <em>I wish you all out there a lot of strength, passion, empathy and enough energy to find your own path and solution, to build your own opinion on things.</em> If you’re directly affected of the war situation, I send you all the best wishes and my hope is for a peaceful together in near future again. At home, we have new neighbours since two weeks — a mother with her child. We try our best to keep them in a normal life, playing and talking with them while the husband/father is in danger and far away from them.</p>\n<h4>web intro</h4>\n<p>Speaking about the web we have much nicer topics to talk about, such as new iOS/Safari 15.4 with image lazy loading, Chrome and Firefox version 100, new Roboto Serif font and how to get better at achieving your goals. But if we don’t and make an exception, even then we have a cooler option than being annoyed about ourselves and instead accept the situation. And finally I’ve been surprised this morning to read that CSS-Tricks, one of my all time favorite sites <a href=\"https://helloanselm.com/writings/thanks-for-css-tricks\">is now part of Digital Ocean</a> and I had to give Chris who built this site a public shoutout and thank you for all what he’s done so far for the web dev community.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"version-100-in-chrome-and-firefox\" class=\"relative \">Both Chrome and Firefox will soon reach version 100. First congrats for that. But <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/02/version-100-in-chrome-and-firefox/\">if you rely on user agent sniffing better check your code</a> as it may break with the first three-digit version out there.</li>\n\t<li id=\"ios-15-4-beta-has-finally-added-icon-support-in-the-manifest-web-push-ar-and-vr-experiments\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://firt.dev/ios-15.4b/\">iOS 15.4</a> has finally added icon support in the manifest, Web Push, AR, and VR experiments, being a big improvement for web apps on Apple devices. Here’s <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/12445/new-webkit-features-in-safari-15-4/\">what’s new in Safari 15.4</a>, including the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element <code>:has()</code> selector, Cascade Layers, new viewport units, CSP Level 3 and more.</li>\n\t<li id=\"with-safari-15-4-accent-color-is-available-everywhere\" class=\"relative \">With Safari 15.4 we’ll <a href=\"https://codepen.io/stefanjudis/pen/abpPvYQ\">get <code>accent-color</code></a> everywhere and so we can style our form inputs in a nice way cross-browser.</li>\n\t<li id=\"mdn-web-docs\" class=\"relative \">There is a new design for one of the best – or maybe the best – websites on frontend developer resources.

It’s about setting realistic goals that we can really achieve, not like “stop eating chocolate” which is unrealistic in so many points.</li>\n\t<li id=\"if-you-buy-a-thing-use-the-thing\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">So we’ve learned that we shouldn’t just buy things and we should aim for minimalism in our lives.

You may still use these services if you ask for permission via Cookie Banner explicitly but it fails to serve the reason to use these services. Webfonts shouldn’t be replaced only by user action and analytics that are only collecting a small portion of user data are barely useful. So in future, self-host webfonts (from a performance perspective it’s also not worse than using the service), and use an analytics provider that’s matching GDPR rules.</li>\n\t<li id=\"php-in-2022\" class=\"relative \">What’s new in PHP in 2022?

For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time. But nature has helped me, my child has helped me, meditation and focusing on my own opinion, on my own body, on my own health helps me staying sane. A big reveal was during my Covid infection: Once I realised how “pre-informed” I was about the disease, I stripped out this bias and listened to my body instead, my health improved next day and recovery was very quick from then on while it stalled over some days before. I share this because I think it’s very important to listen to yourself, to keep track on your own health instead of being drawn down by everyday TV shows that don’t even offer any solution but only share how bad everything is.</p>\n<p>My wish for the future is to empower you to be your own you. You already have the ability, now to find out how to enable it. It may not be the easiest but probably worth it.</p>\n<p>There’s a new year coming and I’d love to see that more people will trust their own mind and body again and work towards this goal.

Now that I had a thought on how to continue with WDRL I realised that this project won’t be sold, won’t be transferred to someone else or such thing. It’s just too personal to do this. But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malteriechmann\">Malte Riechmann</a> will help me collect and write some links from this edition on — it’s all in the early stages but I’m glad because it will help me and save me time.</p>\n<p>In the past two weeks I had the chance to think about a lot of things that are influencing our lives at the moment. It made me realise that it’s upon us how we see our worlds, how we see the problems of our world. It’s our choice how we deal with other people, whether we confront people, cut them short, or whether we’re calm, interested and open minded. I know the latter is not possible all the time, but trying is really worth it. If we understand each other better, we create emotions, we can hold together, we will get stronger and happier. We can support each other in unstable situations, when we’re not sure what to do or what to believe.

In CSS, we get nice tools that help us create better layouts, faster. We also look at new technologies like parent selectors, like responsive images in CSS, reverting CSS settings and container queries.</p>\n<p>One thing that I recognize now that I have my gardening job is that I finally am able to look at web things from a more distant perspective. Which is nice because I now don’t spend any thoughts and nerves on discussions about »native HTML« and similar things that drive Twitter’s platform and make it so negative. When reading my Twitter feed, often a little bit later than the tweets were written, so many things seem unnecessary to me. Previously, I struggled with it a lot and spent hours wasting time on topics that in reality aren’t relevant to me as a person or for our community. I learnt that what matters really is doing something for the community instead of arguing against other people’s opinions. It’s one of the reasons why I started writing the newsletter again, it’s why I organise events here in my neighbourhood nowadays.</p>\n<p>Enjoy your week with a smile now, no matter what your brain says.

I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised in the text that we are at a point where we don’t listen to others anymore, where we disagree or dismiss other people’s ideas straight without reconsidering them, without trying to understand the standpoint. It’s either 100% or 0%. But there are so many goodies if we change this habit that we should exercise the practise of listening and understanding other opinions again. When reading, I realise that I’m trying my best already, I realise that I wish more people would be more open but I also realise that I struggle with it quite regularly, too.

I’ve neglected this project since January this year and just now found enough time to bring it back to life. Why to life? Because I broke my setup in January and then went the bigger upgrade path and had to update and partially refactor my entire custom software for the newsletter. I’m now using Kirby 3 (previously v2) for the project together with my browser web extension to save links into my draft editions. I also switched to use TailwindCSS to understand the concept a bit better and have to say it definitely is worth it. It’s probably not the most suitable solution for this kind of project but for bigger projects in a team with many devs or if a website has to be built on a budget it’s a great option.</p>\n<p>I’m busy with my market garden business growing lots of food which works fine despite weather surprises us here again with colder than usual temperatures and lots of rain over the past weeks. But we now serve over 40 customers, which means we give food to around 80 – 100 people every week during growing period. This is an awesome feeling!</p>\n<p>In parallel I spend a lot of time seeing my son grow up, playing with him. When there’s enough time I work on small website projects and try to organize an event about soil and climate action in summer here in Germany. Let’s see if it’s possible to make this event real.</p>\n<p>The political and social situation we’re currently in continues to baffle me and surprise me. Mostly not in a positive way though which means I’m spending more time reflecting on my thoughts and news, meditating for my mind and to stay sane and calm. I stuggle to accept that so many people have hardline-thoughts in a specific direction, I don’t even care so much in which one. But I think we’re still individuals and every single person should be able to think on their own and decide on their own (thinking as a social, empathic being).</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"new-webkit-features-in-safari-14-1\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/11648/new-webkit-features-in-safari-14-1/\">Safari 14.1</a> is an interesting one because it’s a minor update but brings great joy for us developers: Flexbox <code>gap</code> support, Date &amp; Time Inputs on macOS (woohoo!), WebM support to name the big ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Generic</h3>\n<ul id=\"general\">\n\t<li id=\"the-new-responsive-web-design-in-a-component-driven-world\" class=\"relative \">Una Kravets recaps <a href=\"https://web.dev/new-responsive/\">the new complexity of building modern responsive designs</a> for the web.

WDRL is now seven and a half year old already and the first edition had about twenty email subscribers. What was in there? We had webfont loading behaviour, Speedcurve, a HTML validator, GrumpIcon which created PNG fallbacks for SVG icons via Grunt (remember?), and we moved away from jQuery and started using native JS functions instead. This throwback was quite interesting for me this week. Some topics are still relevant today while others have completely disappeared or solved.<br />\nComing 2021 we now get the ability to slowly replace old hacky code for <code>aspect-ratio</code> with Chrome supporting it now in the latest stable (88), Firefox as well behind flags and in Safari Tech Preview. But we still heavily need <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">CanIUse</a> as project to lookup browser compatibility — thanks so much for building it, Fyrd!</p>\n<p>Not every new year needs new habits, new spectacular projects. It’s enough to realign our minds, our goals, our perspectives. It’s a good time to reconsider active or stale projects, clean up old stuff, declutter or start one new thing.<br />\nI’m personally dedicating a lot of time currently into my Market Gardening business as well as playing with my son in spare time. Besides that, I started organizing my web development business and declutter it. There’s no time to hold on to projects that aren’t in active development or I don’t like anymore but also don’t bring me joy or money.  </p>\n<p>I’m also actively looking for small website projects currently so if you know something or need someone building a small company/project website, email me.<br />\nIf you know about an environmental, social or humanity project that needs my help and could hire me (reduced rate possible) for a limited time, connect me.</p>\n<p>I wish you all the best, health and joy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"new-in-chrome-88-web-google-developers\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2021/01/nic88\">Chrome 88 is out</a> and brings CSS <code>aspect-ratio</code> to all users, it defaults <code>target=\"_blank\"</code> to treat as <code>rel=\"no-opener\"</code> always by default (which is now the web standard).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Generic</h3>\n<ul id=\"general\">\n\t<li id=\"sustainable-web-manifesto\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">The <a href=\"https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/\">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a> is a statement we can all sign to make the web less of a CO2 polluter and more sustainable, in all regards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">UI/UX</h3>\n<ul id=\"concept-design\">\n\t<li id=\"how-to-pick-a-typeface-for-user-interface-and-app-design-zeichenschatz\" class=\"relative \">Oliver Schöndorfer shares <a href=\"https://www.zeichenschatz.net/typografie/how-to-pick-a-typeface-for-user-interface-and-app-design.html\">how to choose a typeface for apps and UIs</a>.

We still don’t know how to deal with the new kinds of diseases short and long-term. We still have no real clue and conclusion how to save our planet (means us humans, the planet will survive). Many of us now are in a state of uncertainty, of frustration, of stress. Working remotely isn’t easy for all of us, the split between childcare and work is hard,  and our social contacts have been reduced to the minimum. That’s definitely not a combination that makes our lives easy, calm and ourselves happy. That’s why I found this writing so useful: <a href=\"https://www.raptitude.com/2020/12/news-is-the-last-thing-we-need-right-now/\">News is the last thing we need right now</a> but it’s addictive like a drug. Reading this made me finally block all the major news sites. I’m already two weeks in, and it feels quite good. And fear not, it’s not that I don’t know about the important news, there are still enough ways to get them from other people. It’s simply that you don’t fetch them actively and don’t fall into the trap of getting caught by another handful of articles. </p>\n<p>I hope you all can enjoy the end of the year, make it a calm and nice time despite of all the things happening all over the world, despite all the articles here, all the news around us and all the other people sharing their fears, their concerns and annoyances with us. Let’s try to reframe it, show empathy, listen to people and try to understand them.

I’m really grateful for this audience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Generic</h3>\n<ul id=\"general\">\n\t<li id=\"so-you-wanna-create-an-eco-friendly-website\" class=\"relative \">Eric Bailey on how we can <a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/blog/so-you-wanna-create-an-eco-friendly-website\">create more eco-friendly websites</a>.

For me, this year has been quite different so far. And no, this is mostly not about some virus spreading across the world but about changing a lot in my work and personal life. My son keeps teaching me new skills, patience, happiness. My <a href=\"https://schaufelundgabel.de/en\">gardening project</a> went well the first year and we’re scaling it next year so we can grow vegetables for more than 70 people. Not to stop here, <a href=\"https://kapellgaerten.de/\">we created a network</a> for workshops and events where local people share their knowledge to improve farming, gardening and live a more resilient and sustainable life as humans.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, being away from client work for half a year was incredibly useful. I now have a different view on some projects again, I refocused on what’s important in projects and got away from just coding and first ask about the goals, about how to achieve them before starting to dive into code. It was one part that I was missing in my job lately but didn’t realize. By talking to other people out there from a huge variety of professional backgrounds instead of constantly living in the bubble of web developers, I gained a different view of looking at and using websites, of how technology is used and how important (or sometimes unimportant) technology is for people.</p>\n<p>On a last note, <em>I’m currently available for a small frontend/fullstack project</em> so if you know something or need someone like me, talk to me. Bonus if it’s for a sustainable company, project or has a positive environmental impact.  </p>\n<p>In full honesty, Gardening is lot of fun, often really hard work, but also not super well paid. And I think I’m not ready to drop web development entirely, it can be so much fun as well!</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"coming-through-with-firefox-82-mozilla-hacks-the-web-developer-blog\" class=\"relative \">Oh yes, two new Firefox versions are here, <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/10/coming-through-with-firefox-82/\">v82</a> and <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/11/firefox-83-is-upon-us/\">v83</a> and they bring us DevTool inspection of server-send events, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Session_API\">Media Session API</a>, CSS <code>::file-selector-button</code> (yay!), <code>conic-gradient</code>, WebRender, Pinch to zoom on desktop, and more.</li>\n\t<li id=\"new-webkit-features-in-safari-14-webkit\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/11340/new-webkit-features-in-safari-14/\">Safari 14 is here</a> and brings Web Extensions, Webpage Translation, Performance improvements, interoperability and better standards and compatibility by improving Web Platform Test passes. Safari now has a privacy report that shows trackers and third party data issues on a webpage to users quite prominently, it brings WebP support, supports CSS <code>image-orientation</code>, <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code> (resetting specificity for the selector to 0, wohoo).

To be honest, I didn’t know this exists until I read the article and it’s super interesting. It’s basically a different cache layer that keeps a live capture of the page including the JavaScript heap in a separate cache. But due to this, it’s not always easy to handle, especially if you have events running on the page so this article contains the answers how to observe the bfcache and add handlers to it. In summary it’s a super powerful feature that’s incredibly useful for web apps but a normal website doesn’t need this layer of complexity.</li>\n\t<li id=\"duetds-date-picker-duet-date-picker-is-an-open-source-version-of-duet-design-system-s-accessible-date-picker-try-live-example-at-https-duetds-github-io-date-picker\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://github.com/duetds/date-picker\">This date picker</a> is very nice, flexible, pretty universal and accessible.

Imagine how this can improve the logging in experience for a good part of your user base.</li>\n\t<li id=\"on-the-web-share-api-css-tricks\" class=\"relative \">Chris Coyier shares how we can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/on-the-web-share-api/\">integrate the Web Share API into our websites</a> instead of these ugly lists of social icons. Note that this depends on us how well it’s perceived and working. For example on macOS it’s supported but most apps on the Mac don’t integrate the Framework for it so they don’t show up in the list of sharing services. We should take care that our products support the native frameworks to make the web a better place.</li>\n\t<li id=\"operator-lookup-search-javascript-operators-josh-w-comeau\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">Wonder which operator to use in JavaScript for a comparison?

Unfortunately, this still needs vendor prefixes at the moment to work in major browsers.</li>\n\t<li id=\"a-deep-dive-into-css-grid-minmax\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">Ahmad Shadeed explains the <a href=\"https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-minmax/\">CSS Grid <code>minmax()</code> function</a> with some really good examples.

And if we need them, it’s sometimes not so easy to create a nice and really good effect so <a href=\"https://letsbuildui.dev/articles/css-text-effects-five-minimal-examples\">this article showing five CSS Text effects is great</a> and includes split colored text, video text, and image background text.</li>\n\t<li id=\"css-variables-101\" class=\"relative \">There are a lot of basic <a href=\"https://ishadeed.com/article/css-vars-101/\">tutorials on CSS Variables but this one</a> contains some pretty handy use cases for variables that go beyond the basic color variable usage but show how we can build a flexible avatar box, defining paddings or gaps by using <code>calc()</code> and variables together.</li>\n\t<li id=\"css-variables-calc-rgb-enforcing-high-contrast-colors-css-tricks\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">Talking about colors in CSS, we have Josh Bader sharing how we can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-variables-calc-rgb-enforcing-high-contrast-colors/\">use CSS variables <code>calc()</code> and <code>rgb()</code> to enforce high contrast colors</a> in our CSS design system.</li>\n\t<li id=\"native-css-masonry-layout-in-css-grid-smashing-magazine\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">Rachel Andrew shares how we can <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/native-css-masonry-layout-css-grid/\">build a Masonry layout fully in CSS with CSS Grid Level 3</a>.</li>\n\t<li id=\"sass-vars-css-vars-and-semantic-theme-vars-daverupert-com\" class=\"relative \">Dave Rupert explores <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2020/10/variable-layers/\">how we should define semantic variable names in the age of light and dark themes</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Work & Life</h3>\n<ul id=\"worklife\">\n\t<li id=\"a-day-in-the-life-of-an-engineering-manager-karl-hughes\" class=\"relative \">Engineering Manager is one of the roles that most people don’t know exactly what it’s about and what these people do. That’s why I found Karl Hughes’ »<a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/engineering-manager\">A day in the life of an Engineering Manager</a>« a really nice one to read. He explains what he does all day and it turns out it’s a role full of soft skills like networking, explaining things or translating between two people, between company departments and to raise awareness around delivery, around process management and recruiting as well as people’s happiness in their jobs. I was Engineering Manager for quite some time as well so I can second what Karl writes here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Go beyond…</h3>\n<ul id=\"gobeyond\">\n\t<li id=\"big-disasters-make-headlines-but-the-most-dangerous-part-of-climate-change-is-that-you-barely-notice-it-s-happening-the-correspondent\" class=\"relative \">You know what scares me most when it comes to climate change and how we as humans perceive it?

Every time a big tornado or wildfires destroy lots of things, our habitats, we read dozens of articles in the news, watch it in TV. But we barely notice that the climate already changed for everyone in the world, that temperatures grew already, that the four seasons changed a little bit, that we face more and more inconsistencies in the weather, more things like wildfires.  I’m not sure if it’s the protection mode in our brains that blocks this away or if it’s just too hard to notice these tiny events when so much other stuff is going on in our lives.</li>\n\t<li id=\"the-corporations-behind-climate-change\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">Who is responsible for climate change? The complexity of the problem makes a simple answer elusive. And yet, responsibility matters—not just for assigning blame, but for finding strategic levers for future change. Here’s insight, here’s evidence, here’s <a href=\"https://parametric.press/issue-02/corporations/\">a good article to help us understand our biggest problem of humanity yet a bit better</a>.

Our time to do something for ourselves, for our relatives, our animals, our planet is running fast. And whether it’s about voting, about the actions to fight a pendemic or to fight to get back our human rights and freedom in face of country lock-downs, or in the fight against global warming which is getting harder each year we don’t do enough.</p>\n<p>Have we considered the impact of our current system to develop, deploy, test and run our Internet services on the planet? How much energy is used to create all these Docker images, to run all the VMs and hardware machines that are just there to run Continuous Integration systems and get rebuilt from scratch each time we push a little piece of code? Now considering that no provider is yet powering their server clusters completely CO2 neutral, not event trying to count the energy and sources we need to build all the hardware in there, this suddenly shines in a not so bright light. At the same time we destroy the biggest value we have as humans: Our soil. By using farming techniques, chemicals that destroy the soil long-term and building more and more houses and business units on the soil, we destroy our ability to produce food that keeps us living. And then we face a pandemic and wonder why… it’s time to act. Not just to watch another video stream. To reduce our impact, to reduce our energy consumption, our car drives, our use of chemicals that hurt ourselves. And instead, we should focus on what’s doing good to us… nature, calmness, friendship, love, kindness.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"postgresql-postgresql-13-released\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-13-released-2077/\">Postgres 13 was released</a> and brings performance benefits, application development conveniences such as native UUIDv4 generation, or datetime() support in the JSON path. <a href=\"https://pganalyze.com/blog/postgres13-better-performance-monitoring-usability\">Here’s an in-depth review</a> including code how to use the new things in v13.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Generic</h3>\n<ul id=\"general\">\n\t<li id=\"this-website-is-killing-the-planet\" class=\"relative \">Steve Messer explains us why <a href=\"https://visitmy.website/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/\">his website is killing the planet</a> — or is it really?

Finally, it’s a standard format that’s going to be implemented by probably all browsers quite quickly. Chrome already has support on Desktop and it’s coming to Android soon, Firefox is currently implementing it and Apple is part of the AV1 working group so they’ll probably add it as well soon. Anyway, <a href=\"https://reachlightspeed.com/blog/using-the-new-high-performance-avif-image-format-on-the-web-today/\">you can already use the new image format</a> by using the <code>picture</code> element and content negotiation methods as we do it for WebP or other formats already. But why AVIF? Well, it’s a standard that is accepted by many major software companies and it’s really good in compressing images while still looking good. In many cases it’s much better than WebP, and it’s really good for not only photos but also illustrations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Accessibility</h3>\n<ul id=\"accessibility\">\n\t<li id=\"adding-prefers-contrast-to-firefox\" class=\"relative \">Microsoft had it for years already as proprietary solution on their platform, now <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/adding-prefers-contrast-to-firefox/\">Mozilla added support for the standard Media Query <code>prefers-contrast</code></a> in Firefox.

This is good, I do this a lot already but one thing to say is that it’s still an attribute so we can’t really write more than one paragraph there. Alternatively, you can still use <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> elements for this use case and just leave the <code>img</code> element’s <code>alt</code> attribute empty.

I’ll have to see how often I can write this again but the goal is to just publish it when I write the draft and not let it wait in the queue for such a long time. If you want to know what happened recently in my life, at least a part of it can be seen <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/schaufelgabel/\">here</a> and there are some <a href=\"https://schaufelundgabel.de/notizen\">notes on my Garden</a> (in German only for now). My own blog has been neglected as well but maybe I’ll find more time over the next weeks to give back some life to it. Now over to this weeks topic:</p>\n<p>It’s our money that rules the world. We together still own more money than anyone else on the planet. What we spend our money on is going to shape the direction where we as society go. We influence whether there will be a war, how many cars are produced, how many pesticides are sprayed across our planet, how many trees in the rainforests are cut, how many planes are polluting  the air we breathe. Every single cent is spent either to a good cause or a bad cause and if we’d bear that in mind every day, we probably would change our shopping behaviour.</p>\n<p>We can opt for renewable energy in our homes, at the workplace, we can buy natural, organic, non processed food. We don’t need to buy a new iPhone every year, a new car every two or five years, we don’t need to fly to far away destinations just for vacation. We don’t need to buy cheap meat, plastics, a pair of Jeans manufactured by poor children who breath chemicals and colors every day because of what we buy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://helloanselm.com/writings/a-small-dot-in-evolution\">We’re a small dot in evolution but we can change where we are on the line</a>.

After months of silence I’m back. Since my last update in February <a href=\"https://helloanselm.com/writings/whats-up-with-me\">a lot has changed, not only in my life</a> but in everyones’. A virus makes us living differently than we are  used to and work has changed with it. A lot of people work from home these days, others lost their jobs and many are facing a change of rules in any part of life. Kids can’t go to school, vacation is not allowed for a specific time or in other cases is enforced to use during the calm times.</p>\n<p>For myself, my life changed quite a bit in March and April. I started with a new field to grow vegetables nearby in March and it keeps me busy for most of the week right now. It’s a CSA and we can already give ten families including our own nearly enough vegetables for the week with the amount growing every week. In April, my son was born, right in the middle of a weird time that enabled us to welcome him calm and easy to our world.</p>\n<p>The Web… where to start? For me, now just watching from outside as I laid down all my jobs during the past months to enjoy family time and do the garden, it felt weird to read about all the technological changes during a virus that changes the lives of many people. On the other hand, life goes on, work goes on, and it’s great to see that some people continue to build amazing things, to make better browsers, to invent technologies and services that help all the other people out there struggling right now.</p>\n<p>Our own species to me remains a mystery: While during the crisis and lockdowns, we achieved to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, this quickly goes back or even worse since we “recover” from the lockdowns. I lost my hope that people will fly less now for private and business purposes and may rethink their lives and get on a more sustainable track. I read a lot about how to prevent getting sick, how to stay sane during this heavy, exhausting times and it’s all about your inner peace, about health and about happiness. Many solutions how to achieve it are going outside right where you are, meditate, get rid of stuff you don’t use or need. Most people in my country know less about cities and villages or areas in their own country than in Italy or France or even more abroad. Why is it still not cool to go on vacation in your own country or neighbour country? It takes you only 1 – 3 hours by train instead of a flight that takes 16 hours just to enjoy another beach that’s no different to what you could visit also with a 2 – 3 hours flight. We all watch nature and outdoor adventure documentaries on Netflix but we don’t do it ourselves. I’ve never been truly happier at work than in the past months being outdoors on my field every day, no matter which weather. My back does not hurt anymore, I’m less stressed out and overall way happier. I don’t earn a lot of money right now and we all know that earning money with growing  vegetables by hand and with love doesn’t pay a lot of bills. But I decided now that it just needs to pay my bills. I’ll continue to be a freelance developer to earn a baseline of money but splitting my work into two jobs was by far the best I could do for myself lately.</p>\n<p>As always, my thoughts are thought as a trigger to you. Disregard it if you don’t want to think about it or don’t have the time right now. Reply to me if you think you want to say something or have a question. Share it, if you think you know someone who would benefit from it or write your own thoughts to the public if you think they’ll benefit others.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"firefox-73-0-see-all-new-features-updates-and-fixes\" class=\"relative \">Uhm, so there’s Firefox <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/73.0/releasenotes/\">73</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/74.0/releasenotes/\">74</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/75.0/releasenotes/\">75</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/76.0/releasenotes/\">76</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0/releasenotes/\">77</a> out since my last update.

There’s so much distraction in our lives today. We tend to continue doing not something different because we have too much on our plates, we are too distracted. We don’t have time to focus on what we really want to do, focus on what we want to change, focus on helping other people or focus on self-care.</p>\n<p>In 2020 <a href=\"https://schaufelundgabel.de/\">I opened a Community Supported Agriculture</a> to provide local, naturally grown and healthy food to people nearby. No need for them to buy it in the supermarket where it was transported many hundred kilometers through the country and isn’t fresh anymore. My action to foster local community, to do something for the better, for the climate, for other people with a real impact.</p>\n<p>I will also take three months of parental leave time for my family (my wife and soon my newborn child) and for myself, to get focus on the things that are in my mind but never find time to think properly about. This means no work, no WDRL, no other developer related stuff during that time so an entirely different lifestyle for a limited time.

But how do we get to a good culture? Most importantly, we need to keep in mind that culture is not a top down approach. Anyone in a company is part of it and needs to foster it. As always, there will be some people or a specific person in the company who is leading the efforts and ideally it’s one from HR or the director itself. But what we can see in bigger companies that there are many subcultures in the various departments and teams and it all depends on these individual groups whether they spend energy on creating a communication culture, talk about work ethics or not. In the end, work for most of us happens during the most prominent 8 hours of the day—the daylight hours. Why would we spend it on a place with a bad culture? Better spend some energy on creating a healthy, warm and friendly atmosphere where we love to go to each day.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"chromium-blog-introducing-quieter-permission-ui-for-notifications\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/introducing-quieter-permission-ui-for.html\">Chrome will change how they ask for notification permissions</a> to protect the users from these annoying requests.

It’s a matter of the mindset, it’s a matter of will. The only problem I see here is that they say their title says they removed the last tracker but instead what they did is that they now use a custom analytics service that isn’t a third-party. However, I see business metrics combined with the very basic, anonymously collected user browsing behaviour on a website as way more powerful than having e.g. Google Analytics in place. The power of Business Intelligence tools is huge and lets us easily detect problems in our services, see which features are used and which ones are not.

Time to work on other things like woodwork, or preparing and planning the next year’s Gardening season. I’m going to build a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture\">CSA</a> and next year will be the preparation and experimentation season before going into full production for other people so they can enjoy local, fresh and carefully grown food at a reasonable price.</p>\n<p>The end of the year is typically the time where everyone asks about new year goals. Well, whether you have goals or not, we can definitely care more about how we treat other people, whether they’re co-workers, our managers or clients. If we show empathy and try to be helpful instead of arrogant, we not only build a better product but also build a network of trust, a network of reliable people that we can count on when we need help. In times where everything happens in virtual worlds, it’s more and more important to not be just any brand out there but one that stands out because they are personal and kind. If you have any feedback on how I can do better with this newsletter or <a href=\"https://colloq.io/\">Colloq</a>, write me an email. And if you know great examples that stood out for you, let me know as well e.g. on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@helloanselm\">Mastodon</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helloanselm\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">News</h3>\n<ul id=\"news\">\n\t<li id=\"new-in-chrome-79-web-google-developers\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/12/nic79\">Chrome 79 is out</a> and brings maskable icons on Android PWAs, the WebXR Device API, and an origin trial of a “Wake Lock API”. In the DevTools, you can now see why a cookie was blocked, emulate CSS media queries like <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> or <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-4 font-bold text-xl\">Generic</h3>\n<ul id=\"general\">\n\t<li id=\"bpf-a-new-type-of-software\" class=\"relative \"><a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-12-02/bpf-a-new-type-of-software.html\">BPF: A New Type of Software</a>. These are interesting softwares as they don’t show up as nomal processes or kernel modules. They introduce a new interface for applications to make kernel requests, alongside syscalls and is a super interesting change in how operating systems work with software.</li>\n\t<li id=\"it-s-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind\" class=\"relative -mx-4 p-2 bg-green-100 rounded\">It seems that Jeff Bezos grandfather once said to him “one day you’ll understand that it’s harder to be kind than clever.” And this is very true, if you think about all the clever technologies and products out there.
