      "summary": "March came and gone. I chased fitness. We went on Spring Break. Growing a business. Baseball games. Failed on blogging. Here is a retelling of the vibes.\nClosing my rings\nThis month I decided I would undergo a challenge to close my rings on my Apple Watch every single day for the whole month and I succeeded!1\n\n\n\n\nIt’s safe to say this hasn’t ever happened. My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts. As far as workout programs go, I appreciate the body diversity in Apple Fitness+ — it’s not a bunch of yoga thin hard bodies yelling at me to touch my toes to my ears, it’s real people.\nDid it make a difference in my weight? No. Not at all. In fact, I weigh a half pound more. My consumption habits were the same, I did nothing extravagant or different. Not much to glean except that I believe this experiment showed me that my weight is not a function of exercise, even 10x my normal exercise doesn’t make a difference.\nThe best thing about the last month is that I’ve carved a bit of a routine into my life. Made some space for me. I have a good sense of what it takes to close my rings each day and it feels sustainable. I feel more fit, even though no one else would know it from the outside.\nThe late flight to Phoenix\nFor Spring Break we decided to visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Phoenix. Hands down one of the worst flights of my life; a woman too drunk to fly, police to escort her, and her husband (also drunk) deciding to talk back to the police. Per FAA protocol, we all had to deplane to resolve the situation. Another lesson in how much the pandemic has effected our ability to function in society.\nBut we got there, sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac for a gate, and arrived at grandma’s house in Phoenix at 3 AM Austin time. Wrecked.\nThe kids had a great visit though. Grandparents and cousins work wonders. Cousins self-propel each other. Pools, sunshine, zoo trips, and more. My wife and I could go on long walks, look at campers, and have a couple margaritas.\nThe “time off” wasn’t as restful as I needed, due in part to some lingering obligations hanging over my head…\nWork, talks, and workshops\nIt’s a busy but important time at Luro. Onboarding new customers but also figuring out next steps in the life of our startup and evaluating a pretty big architectural change (dedicated managed instances → complete multi-tenant application). Lots of discussions and ambient stress. I fried my brain one day doing a cost-benefit analysis on Rails versus Nuxt.\nAdding on to my normal workload, I prepared a talk for An Event Apart and a workshop for Frontend Masters workshop, both on Web Components. It’s been a big year for web components and I’m happy to continue talking about them.\nI enjoy presenting. I feel like it fits within my natural range of extroversion. Talks and workshops are a lot of work though piled on a busy schedule. After years of practice, I feel like I do a decent job estimating the work required and am able to plan accordingly.\nCandidly, the one thing I don’t predict well is the cloud of stress that looms over me a month or so before an event. It’s a looming feeling of excess obligations. As much as I love doing these presentations, they add a lot to a busy schedule and even busier mind. But that impulse to say “no” to future talks conflicts with my impulse to amortize my talks as much as possible.\nOne day without caffeine\nI inadvertently attempted a caffeine fast. 10am and I hadn’t had any coffee, so I decided to try it. It did not go well. I was in bed at 4pm with a cursed headache. I went to bed with a headache. I woke up with a headache. I was grumpy, irritable, and almost deleted my whole Twitter account. It took me by surprise how awful my body reacted.\nApparently 50% of people suffer caffeine withdrawal headaches and it sort of doesn’t matter how much caffeine you have (over 200mg/day). I’m in the unlucky half. I think it’s worthwhile to break chains of addiction when they present themselves, so I may attempt a fast again but may ween myself with half-caf for a bit first before I try again.\n\n💪 Fitness\n\nClosed my rings 31 times.\nDidn’t do much pickleball.\n\n\n🧶 Crafting\n\nI made a Gundam Ground Combat Urban Type and it may be my most favorite one yet. Here’s a picture\n\n\n📖 Reading - 4 books + 2 graphic novels\n\nRun - John Lewis’s retelling of America after the Civil Rights Act and his falling out with SNCC.\nThe City of Ember - My son read The City of Ember for a book report so I read the graphic novel and it’s good. I bet the book is way better tho.\nThe Four - Scott Galloway’s look at Amazon, Apple , Facebook, and Google. I liked the first half of looking at how each of the companies operate, but lost the thread in the later chapters where the personal anecdotes started coming in.\nExpressive Design Systems - Yesenia Perez-Cruz expertly outlines what makes a good, effective design system, and also how you can add life to a design system by allowing room for customization (or “seasons”). Great read.\nWhat White People Can Do Next - This one might be controversial, but sort of comes to the conclusion allyship is not the answer 😱  - the crux of the argument is that coalition building is a lot more effective and doesn’t reinforce white savior or victim tropes. I enjoyed the book and I’d be curious to hear what others thought.\nCubed - This book is so good! It’s the history of the modern workplace. I’m enjoying this book so much it’s taking twice as long to get through because I’m taking notes.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime\n\nRanking of Kings (Crunchyroll) - The story of young prince Bojji inheriting the throne of his warrior father… but Bojji is deaf, mute, and can’t swing a sword. How will he ever become king?\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nOlli Olli World\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes\n\nSpacing in Design Systems\nShopTalkShow has a vanity URL on YouTube now: https://www.youtube.com/shoptalkshow\n\n\n📝 Blogging - 2 posts this month. I still have lots of drafts, but I got sideswiped by other work obligations.\n\nGoodbye, Big Freeda - a eulogy for my old camper\nDifferent people, different ways - another songcatching post about an old Buffy Sainte Marie song from Sesame Street that we use in parenting our kids.\nI’ve also decided to redesign my blog at some point. Will need to be after the workshops and talks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically there are two days where I was one tick off on my stand goal (Mar 27) and one minute off on my workout goal (Mar 29). I’m not going to beat myself up about it. ↩\n\n\n",

      "content_text": "March came and gone. I chased fitness. We went on Spring Break. Growing a business. Baseball games. Failed on blogging. Here is a retelling of the vibes.\nClosing my rings\nThis month I decided I would undergo a challenge to close my rings on my Apple Watch every single day for the whole month and I succeeded!1\n\n\n\n\nIt’s safe to say this hasn’t ever happened. My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts. As far as workout programs go, I appreciate the body diversity in Apple Fitness+ — it’s not a bunch of yoga thin hard bodies yelling at me to touch my toes to my ears, it’s real people.\nDid it make a difference in my weight? No. Not at all. In fact, I weigh a half pound more. My consumption habits were the same, I did nothing extravagant or different. Not much to glean except that I believe this experiment showed me that my weight is not a function of exercise, even 10x my normal exercise doesn’t make a difference.\nThe best thing about the last month is that I’ve carved a bit of a routine into my life. Made some space for me. I have a good sense of what it takes to close my rings each day and it feels sustainable. I feel more fit, even though no one else would know it from the outside.\nThe late flight to Phoenix\nFor Spring Break we decided to visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Phoenix. Hands down one of the worst flights of my life; a woman too drunk to fly, police to escort her, and her husband (also drunk) deciding to talk back to the police. Per FAA protocol, we all had to deplane to resolve the situation. Another lesson in how much the pandemic has effected our ability to function in society.\nBut we got there, sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac for a gate, and arrived at grandma’s house in Phoenix at 3 AM Austin time. Wrecked.\nThe kids had a great visit though. Grandparents and cousins work wonders. Cousins self-propel each other. Pools, sunshine, zoo trips, and more. My wife and I could go on long walks, look at campers, and have a couple margaritas.\nThe “time off” wasn’t as restful as I needed, due in part to some lingering obligations hanging over my head…\nWork, talks, and workshops\nIt’s a busy but important time at Luro. Onboarding new customers but also figuring out next steps in the life of our startup and evaluating a pretty big architectural change (dedicated managed instances → complete multi-tenant application). Lots of discussions and ambient stress. I fried my brain one day doing a cost-benefit analysis on Rails versus Nuxt.\nAdding on to my normal workload, I prepared a talk for An Event Apart and a workshop for Frontend Masters workshop, both on Web Components. It’s been a big year for web components and I’m happy to continue talking about them.\nI enjoy presenting. I feel like it fits within my natural range of extroversion. Talks and workshops are a lot of work though piled on a busy schedule. After years of practice, I feel like I do a decent job estimating the work required and am able to plan accordingly.\nCandidly, the one thing I don’t predict well is the cloud of stress that looms over me a month or so before an event. It’s a looming feeling of excess obligations. As much as I love doing these presentations, they add a lot to a busy schedule and even busier mind. But that impulse to say “no” to future talks conflicts with my impulse to amortize my talks as much as possible.\nOne day without caffeine\nI inadvertently attempted a caffeine fast. 10am and I hadn’t had any coffee, so I decided to try it. It did not go well. I was in bed at 4pm with a cursed headache. I went to bed with a headache. I woke up with a headache. I was grumpy, irritable, and almost deleted my whole Twitter account. It took me by surprise how awful my body reacted.\nApparently 50% of people suffer caffeine withdrawal headaches and it sort of doesn’t matter how much caffeine you have (over 200mg/day). I’m in the unlucky half. I think it’s worthwhile to break chains of addiction when they present themselves, so I may attempt a fast again but may ween myself with half-caf for a bit first before I try again.\n\n💪 Fitness\n\nClosed my rings 31 times.\nDidn’t do much pickleball.\n\n\n🧶 Crafting\n\nI made a Gundam Ground Combat Urban Type and it may be my most favorite one yet. Here’s a picture\n\n\n📖 Reading - 4 books + 2 graphic novels\n\nRun - John Lewis’s retelling of America after the Civil Rights Act and his falling out with SNCC.\nThe City of Ember - My son read The City of Ember for a book report so I read the graphic novel and it’s good. I bet the book is way better tho.\nThe Four - Scott Galloway’s look at Amazon, Apple , Facebook, and Google. I liked the first half of looking at how each of the companies operate, but lost the thread in the later chapters where the personal anecdotes started coming in.\nExpressive Design Systems - Yesenia Perez-Cruz expertly outlines what makes a good, effective design system, and also how you can add life to a design system by allowing room for customization (or “seasons”). Great read.\nWhat White People Can Do Next - This one might be controversial, but sort of comes to the conclusion allyship is not the answer 😱  - the crux of the argument is that coalition building is a lot more effective and doesn’t reinforce white savior or victim tropes. I enjoyed the book and I’d be curious to hear what others thought.\nCubed - This book is so good! It’s the history of the modern workplace. I’m enjoying this book so much it’s taking twice as long to get through because I’m taking notes.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime\n\nRanking of Kings (Crunchyroll) - The story of young prince Bojji inheriting the throne of his warrior father… but Bojji is deaf, mute, and can’t swing a sword. How will he ever become king?\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nOlli Olli World\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes\n\nSpacing in Design Systems\nShopTalkShow has a vanity URL on YouTube now: https://www.youtube.com/shoptalkshow\n\n\n📝 Blogging - 2 posts this month. I still have lots of drafts, but I got sideswiped by other work obligations.\n\nGoodbye, Big Freeda - a eulogy for my old camper\nDifferent people, different ways - another songcatching post about an old Buffy Sainte Marie song from Sesame Street that we use in parenting our kids.\nI’ve also decided to redesign my blog at some point. Will need to be after the workshops and talks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically there are two days where I was one tick off on my stand goal (Mar 27) and one minute off on my workout goal (Mar 29). I’m not going to beat myself up about it. ↩\n\n\n",

      "summary": "February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.\nSurvived the freeze\nTexas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.\nSold the pop-up\n\nOver Valentine’s weekend, we tried to go camping with our friends, but the pop-up… didn’t… pop-up. We abandoned it at the campsite overnight and drove it to the RV lot the next day where we sold it for next to nothing. We could have put money into it and potentially sold it for more, but we needed out. It cost us ~$500 in maintenance every time we wanted to take it out and that caused me more stress than relaxation. Lots of memories, but a new chapter in camping begins… but not jumping back into the camper ownership game too soon.\nGunpla and mechanical keyboard crafting\nI made two crafts this month that I’m pleased with, but also some mixed reviews.\nXXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms\n\nA Gundam but with extra guns, the XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms. This was my first High Grade (HG) 1/144th scale gunpla. It’s a cool model with lots of expression but I was initially a bit disappointed by a wobbly waist and a leg that kept falling off. Between meetings one day I decided to rebuild the legs, found the place where I messed up, and now it’s sturdy-gurdy and much more enjoyable.\nI bought another HG model I plan on doing but am feeling the itch to go up to a Master Grade (MG) 1/100th scale model. In the meantime, I’m going to try my hand at panel lining (I bought ~$30 worth of markers!) to add some depth to my current models.\nKBDfans Mountain Ergo\n\nOn an impulse I bought the KBDfans Mountain Ergo keyboard kit. It’s an Alice-like layout (split, but staggard layout) but the tented chassis makes it a bit more ergonomic. ~$500 is a lot for a keyboard, but I regretted missing the group buy, so I impulsively bought it when restock units went on sale.\nSuch a satisfying build. The sandwiched base-plate layers, the snap and click as switches lock in to the hotswappable circuit board, and thocky keypresses of lubed stabilizers. Finished off with a (cheap) set of all-white Japanese hiragana keycaps. It’s an absolute unit and weighs more than a newborn child.\nI may post a more in-depth review, but as good and beautiful as this keyboard is… I like my Moonlander better? Or I had the Moonlander tuned a bit more ergonomically for me? It’s nice to type on though, but I think my problems are more related to 60% keyboard layouts being suboptimal for development.\nFrontend Masters Web Components Workshop\nMost February evenings went to putting together a Web Components course for Frontend Masters. I planned the workshop, made a website, and got feedback from friends in the ShopTalk Discord. Workshops aren’t my forté, but it’s coming together and feels good to be ahead of schedule rather than scrambling as the deadline approaches.\nI’m also updating my web component talk for An Event Apart: Spring Summit, so all the web component research parlays together nicely. There’s a sense of accomplishment in having turned a talk into a workshop and a website. Who knows what’s next, a book? A graphic novel? A movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Time will tell.\nLuro 📈\nAnother great month of progress on Luro. We began onboarding our first customer which brought up a lot of major and minor issues with the application, nearly tripling the number of issues in the backlog. Expected, of course, but it triggered a need for better issue management (projects, labels, etc) and taking time to triage incoming issues rather than letting them remain in memory.\nWe went with GitHub’s new beta Projects feature. With Projects, I can view the board in a handful of dimensions instead of only a reverse chronological list. It’s been helpful for prioritizing issues and grouping work. The issue queue is nearly back down to pre-flood levels, but we may need some dedicated help soon.\nUkraine\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has occupied a lot of my heart and worried brain. There’s a lot to say on this but to watch a tiny tyrant amass hundreds of thousands of troops, lie so brazenly, threaten nuclear war, bomb innocent civilians, all in an attempt to seize a country by force… and there’s so little we can do to stop it… it’s heart-wrenching. As I heard someone say, the ultimate outcome of this war — the great costs paid — depends entirely on a single autocrat coming to his senses.\nMy heart goes out to all those who are victims of an unjust war.\nHigh-level recap of some stat-based metrics\n\n💪 Fitness\n\nClosed my rings 7 times.\nSkill cap problems at Pickleball, a lot of 3.5/4.0+ tennis players have showed up and losing every point makes Pickleball less fun. “Git gud”, I guess or… no.\n\n\n📖 Reading - I read two books this month that touch on similar topics, but I liked one and hated the other. The juxtaposition helped me realize what kind of non-fiction books I like; those that tend to be more academic and/or written by people with PhDs.\n\nEverything is Figureoutable - This book comes highly recommended but I did not enjoy it. I agree with the premise, that you can figure out most problems, but the narrative frustrated me.\nThe Upside of Stress - This was my kind of book. Correcting old science with new science, adjacent scientific studies. Written by a PhD. I welcome the challenge to the societal mindset that stress kills.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime\n\nGundam II, Gundam III (Netflix)\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nOlli Olli World\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes - We moved ShopTalk over to its own YouTube channel. It’s a minor but impactful change that will allow all ShopTalk content to exist in one home.\n\nNew ShopTalk YouTube Channel - Like and subscribe\nCSS Quiz Show - Chris and I did a couple of CSS quizzes.\n\n\n📝 Blogging - 6 posts, 3 new formats.

      "title": "The 15 minute fix vs the 30 day fix",
      "summary": "Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\n\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\n\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.\nThe 30 day fix\nThe 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.\nThere’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.\nBut… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.\n30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.\nExample: The case of the evolving API needs\nI built an API to retrieve posts from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.\nGET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n\nBut when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of post.title and post.id fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThen we needed to have a category filter on the /posts/lists endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThis worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these /posts/list/:category queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a limit as a query param.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nAhh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need orderBy and groupBy params for sorting, include params for an ad-hoc JOIN of related records, ability to sort JOIN records; a little less rigidity in the design.\nWe — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation. With all the added options, the /posts/list endpoint is a mess — it may not even need to exist! — and we could solve a lot of problems by sitting down and thinking about the solution a little bit harder. But I actually don’t know if we made a mistake. We were running towards getting feedback. We don’t need a big infrastructure project when sandbags would fix the issue.\nTo build or over-build, that is the question\nIt’s a tough situation that comes down to estimating. Not estimating in a “choose some fake fibonacci numbers” sense, but in an overcoming personal biases sense. Are you over-estimating your need for the 30 day fix? Are you under-estimating how well the 15 minute fix is going to work? Are you operating emotionally out of a bad experience from a previous situation? Have you overcome your personal optimism bias? What’s the pressure from management like?\nOften you don’t know the scope of the problem until you have users, so over-building at the beginning of the process is probably a mistake. The 15 minute fix gets you closer to actually learning what your codebase needs. But months down the line, you have a codebase full of 15 minute fixes that now need 30 day upgrades. Time-bombs. Could you have saved time by architecting the 30 day fix from the beginning? Or could you have saved a lot of money by chipping away at the problem with more and more 15 minute fixes?\nAnd that’s what it comes down to: economics. A 15 minute fix and a 30 day fix have colossally different costs and impacts. Can your business afford that time? Can your users afford the delay? Is it a Monty Hall Rewrite problem where the fix could actually be worse once it’s landed? I struggle with this because I hate rework, but if you think of software as evolving, then rework and maintenance is part of the job.\nHow do you decide? I don’t know. The best advice I have is: Never go to the grocery store when you’re hungry… but y’know, for software.",

      "content_text": "Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\n\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\n\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.\nThe 30 day fix\nThe 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.\nThere’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.\nBut… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.\n30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.\nExample: The case of the evolving API needs\nI built an API to retrieve posts from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.\nGET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n\nBut when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of post.title and post.id fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThen we needed to have a category filter on the /posts/lists endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThis worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these /posts/list/:category queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a limit as a query param.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nAhh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need orderBy and groupBy params for sorting, include params for an ad-hoc JOIN of related records, ability to sort JOIN records; a little less rigidity in the design.\nWe — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation. With all the added options, the /posts/list endpoint is a mess — it may not even need to exist! — and we could solve a lot of problems by sitting down and thinking about the solution a little bit harder. But I actually don’t know if we made a mistake. We were running towards getting feedback. We don’t need a big infrastructure project when sandbags would fix the issue.\nTo build or over-build, that is the question\nIt’s a tough situation that comes down to estimating. Not estimating in a “choose some fake fibonacci numbers” sense, but in an overcoming personal biases sense. Are you over-estimating your need for the 30 day fix? Are you under-estimating how well the 15 minute fix is going to work? Are you operating emotionally out of a bad experience from a previous situation? Have you overcome your personal optimism bias? What’s the pressure from management like?\nOften you don’t know the scope of the problem until you have users, so over-building at the beginning of the process is probably a mistake. The 15 minute fix gets you closer to actually learning what your codebase needs. But months down the line, you have a codebase full of 15 minute fixes that now need 30 day upgrades. Time-bombs. Could you have saved time by architecting the 30 day fix from the beginning? Or could you have saved a lot of money by chipping away at the problem with more and more 15 minute fixes?\nAnd that’s what it comes down to: economics. A 15 minute fix and a 30 day fix have colossally different costs and impacts. Can your business afford that time? Can your users afford the delay? Is it a Monty Hall Rewrite problem where the fix could actually be worse once it’s landed? I struggle with this because I hate rework, but if you think of software as evolving, then rework and maintenance is part of the job.\nHow do you decide? I don’t know. The best advice I have is: Never go to the grocery store when you’re hungry… but y’know, for software.",

The following is one of the songs from my community, a lament, I’d like to share with you all.\n<a href=\"https://sethwoods.bandcamp.com/album/been-in-this-war-for-too-long-liturgical-demonstrations-from-bygone-days\">Been In This War For Too Long: Liturgical Demonstrations From Bygone Days by Seth Woods</a>\nG             D           C  \nRemember your mercies, O Lord  \nG                 D  \nWe’ve got so much hurt  \nRemember we’ve fallen so hard  \nFrom our concrete towers to Earth  \nRemember we sleep every night  \nWith doors locked and shades pulled down tight  \nRemember your mercies, O Lord  \n\nG             C       G  \nWe’re already so terrified  \nEm                  C  \nWe just stay in one place  \nWe just cover our faces  \nWe just look at our hands  \nEm                      C       D  \nWe just don’t know what time it is  \n\nRemember your mercies, O Lord  \nJust could you please be kind  \nWe’re grateful for so many things  \nBut you also gave us these minds  \nLike you gave us the sky and the trees  \nAnd we couldn’t keep them from harm  \nRemember your mercies, O Lord  \nWe’ve wired our hearts with alarm  \n\nWe just sit in these chairs now  \nWe just stare at these screens now  \nWe just work all the time now  \nWe just don’t know what day it is  \n\nWe’re tired and hungry for dreams now  \nWe’ve traded our love for relief  \nWhen our casualties rise like black rivers  \nFrom deserts to flood city streets  \nRemember your mercies, O Lord  \nPlease don’t deny us our song  \nWe’re rambling, restless, and weary  \nWe’ve been in this war for too long  \nWe’re black and we’re blue and we’re broke down  \nWe’ve been in this war for too long  \n\nWords and music by Chris Simpson (Mineral), public domain.\n",

      "summary": "I’m not planning on leaving the industry (yet), but before I go I’d like to offer up what I know when it comes to complaining about web browsers.\nI have logged hundreds of hours complaining about browsers on Twitter, on podcasts, and on this blog. I have logged thousands more hours trying to keep up with browsers and I frequently interact with people who write specs and make browsers. I have not been 100% successful in my efforts to get a <rupert> element as my legacy but I have learned a lot about giving feedback to web browsers.\nBrowsers are really complex\nEric Meyer recently put it very well…\n\n[W]eb browsers are actually 60fps+ rendering environments.  They’re First-Person Scrollers.\n\nWhen you complain about browsers, the first thing you must know is: Browsers are big, complex pieces of software that must run very, very, very fast.\n“Browsers should do _______” may sound like an easy feature, but have you considered that your idea might be a bad idea? Not just bad on paper, but bad on a bad for computers level. Browsers render the page at 60fps even while scrolling so your idea must work within a 4ms window… along with the million other tasks the browser is trying to do during that same 4ms window.\nTo get your feature implemented you’ll need either a giant pile of cash or the willing ear of someone who works on a browser. And then you’ll need lots of consensus. Browsers are an exercise in consensus building; getting consensus for features inside your company, then shop it to web developers, then with other browsers, then you have to run the gauntlet through the official W3C working group tracks on the path to standardization. It’s consensus all the way down. Lots of input and lots of compromises along the way.\nLet’s dig into some of the different ways we lay people can offer input and what I think works and doesn’t work based on past attempts.\nTalking shit doesn’t work\nComplaining on Twitter sure does feel good but it doesn’t do much other than burning bridges and burning through people’s patience. I guess you may also get hit with the mute button which is probably the opposite effect you were hoping for. Despite how good or valid your complaint is, combativeness results in immediate dismissal by your target audience… not once, but for years. People hold grudges for a shockingly long time.\nJokes, snark, and sarcasm walk a thin line too. Exhibit A: I know some people at Google are a bit salty with me because I made a dumb joke on Twitter about <toast>, AMP, and Chrome seemingly over-exerting its dominant market share position in 2019. The irony here is I actually like the <std-element> pathway, but my commentary (punditry?) didn’t help as I joined the pile on, which was so bad that no one wants to ever try shipping native web components ever again.\nBeing toxic and abusive to the people that make browsers doesn’t add to the conversation. One possible goal it might achieve is amplifying feelings of burnout in the people you’re hoping will adopt your cause. We don’t need to be naive about business incentives (e.g. AMP, App Store revenue, developer mindshare landgrabs, etc) but we can dial back the heat a bit.\nI recommend being specific about the features you need, curb the outrage.\nSaying “is the new IE” doesn’t work\nTo the previous point, lobbing general criticisms of monopolistic behaviors or constant out-of-datedness doesn’t help further the conversation. I agree that browsers probably need to go to court more for their behavior, but each browser company has its own historical baggage. Browser folk and fanboys will often deflect with whataboutism and invoke some kind of other finger pointing (Safari’s slow release cycle, Google’s data collection, Brave CEO’s support of California’s Prop 8 in 2007, Mozilla’s mass layoffs and dependency on Google Search money, Microsoft’s actual IE monopoly, etc). The criticism doesn’t land like it used to.\nI’d recommend being specific about what features are missing and what is holding you back.\nYelling about privacy sort of works\nPrivacy is important and can raise security flags, but invoking privacy like a boogeyman doesn’t go far. Privacy is such a big topic, people (and corporations) often have different perspectives on what qualifies as a privacy invasion. Raise the flag, yes, it’s important to yell about what’s important but don’t let them run off and decide what “privacy” means.\nIt’s better to be specific about what privacy measures you are requesting.\nAnd now for the best thing you could ever do…\nBlogging your specific problems works\nThe best thing I’ve ever done in my career is blog about my specific problems with browsers (or any software you’re passionate about). This goes for software beyond browsers too. I’ve done this for IE, Safari, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Windows 10, WSL and I’ve seen first hand how a “friction log” can become a powerful tool in an organization.\nBehind the scenes, your posts will get picked up by external-facing developer advocates and shared internally. A single blog post is worth 10,000 tweets. It’s valuable because it shows you thought through your problem and narrowed it down to a set of specific issues. All the more if it’s non-combative (see above). I’ve seen this play out dozens of times.\nA simplified example of a problem solved by Container Queries is a million times more helpful than an abusive “Support Container Queries, ya fuckers” jab. A list of features causing expensive workarounds is great. If you’re blocked on a feature due to a lack of implementation… blog it.\nI’ll even simplify this into to a user story for you:\nWhen building [project]\nI couldn't accomplish [task] \nBecause [browser] \nDoesn't support [feature]\n\nAdd a bit more context or story there, edit out the drama, and I think you’ve got a legitimate and useful criticism people can act on. You may even get on Hacker News (not that you’d want to do that). There may be times where you’ll need to raise the social temperature on an issue, but you have to start here and outline the actual problems first.\nOther activities that help\nIf intentionally collecting your thoughts and blogging sounds like too much, here’s some other entry points in providing feedback to browsers.\n\nResponding to browser surveys helps - If you see someone from a browser ask for feedback, jump on it. These surveys turn into internal data that get put in powerpoint decks and shared around.\nStarring issues helps - If a browser has an open bug tracker and you can star issues, do it. It sends a signal to engineers that this it’s an important request. No need to comment unless you have stack traces, a star is enough.\nSaying “Thank you” helps - You catch more flys with honey than you do with vinegar. If a browser or someone you know shipped a cool feature, say thank you. Give that person or team some recognition. Heck, they may even get promoted and have more internal leverage. Do that over and over and guess what, I bet if you have an actual complaint people will listen.\nMaking demos helps - Hear about a beta feature or an origin trial? Play with it! Find a way to crash the GPU? File a bug! Making demos in CodePens or some other sharable code format is probably the fastest way to become a person who gives feedback to browsers and they may even start reaching out to you for feedback first.\n\nWrapping up, there’s one more thing you can do…\nMake other browsers better with this one weird trick\nIf you truly want other browsers to get better… use other browsers! Money tends to follow eyeballs. Engineers get apportioned appropriately. And be sure to blog your troubles along the way.\nThus ends the imparting of what I know when it comes to complaining about web browsers.",

Making demos in CodePens or some other sharable code format is probably the fastest way to become a person who gives feedback to browsers and they may even start reaching out to you for feedback first.\n\nWrapping up, there’s one more thing you can do…\nMake other browsers better with this one weird trick\nIf you truly want other browsers to get better… use other browsers! Money tends to follow eyeballs. Engineers get apportioned appropriately. And be sure to blog your troubles along the way.\nThus ends the imparting of what I know when it comes to complaining about web browsers.",

      "title": "Vibe Check №13",
      "summary": "Buckle up. This month turned out to be a big one. Writing it all out feels like an entire year went by, so I’ll start with the bad that happened at the beginning of the month and move towards the good.\nGot COVID\nWhen I posted my Vibe Check №12 and End of 2021 posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.\nThankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tell.\nI don’t plan on getting COVID again, but if there’s a silver lining, it’s that at least the general fear of getting it has gone away. But that’s a me-centric perspective when 887,780+ people have passed away from this thing.\nRest in peace, Jackson\nOn January 4th a friend of our family unexpectedly passed away. Jackson taught me a lot over the years and had a helluva life story. During the civil war in his home country of Liberia, he and some other boys were taken out and left in the desert to die. He survived and came to the US as a young boy in a shipping container. He married (later divorced) and had four wonderful kids. Despite the challenges in his life, he always had an impossible sense of hope which could brighten your day.\nThrough Jackson I saw first hand how difficult the US immigration system is when a single stain on your record makes you a target for deportation. No pathways, delayed work permits, years of unemployment, immigration lawyers fees, health issues, doctors bills; I saw how unfair the system was to him and his family.\nBut he loved his kids. Every ounce of concern and every penny he made went to providing for his kids. His kids are nearly grown up now, the first is going off to college on scholarship, and I know they’re going to miss him but I know they know how much he loved them. It’s a sad situation to lose a dedicated parent in high school. If you can spare a prayer for Jackson’s kids and our neighbor Cleo (who was like a mother to Jackson), thank you.\n2022 Mantras\nIt’s been a rough start to the year for sure, but we’re getting through it. I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.\n\n2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent) - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.\n2022: Be less disgusting - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.\n\nAnd for grown-ups, I got another one.\n\n2022: Buy your happiness - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.\n\nI hate how consumerist that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!\nEpisode 500 of ShopTalk\nI wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.\nAnd celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.\nI built my first Gunpla\n\nOn a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.\nMaking my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.\nI have a new ergonomic keyboard to build, a book of Frank Lloyd Wright kirigami papercraft models, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.\nAnother big refactor on Luro\nOne of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on Luro. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a tech de jour it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.\ntl;dr— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with boring technology, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.\nStatistics\nBecause I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.\n\n💪 Fitness - Closed my rings 5 days this month\n\nBack doing Apple Fitness\nBack doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off\n\n\n📖 Reading\n\nPeril - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books? You base content heirarchy on what’s before and what’s after?\nViolence. Speed. Momentum. - The Dr. Disrespect origin story. 100% toxic action figure masculinity and 100% YAYAYAYAYAYA.\nApocalyptiGirl - I enjoyed this simple post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi.\nHead Lopper Vol 4 - Possibly my least favorite Head Lopper, but still Head Lopper so it’s weird and good.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime - Got COVID, so I had time to watch some shows.\n\nFoundation (AppleTV) - A sci-fi story based on the books by Isaac Asimov. The story lines are a bit drummed up but it makes for better TV.\nKomi Can’t Communicate (Netflix) - A shonen story about a boy helping a classmate who has a fear of talking. The supporting cast helps carry the show.\nNew Game (Crunchyroll) - A show about new situation anxiety centered around a recent high school graduate joining a game studio.\nGundam I (Netflix) - 13 TV episodes smashed into one long movie with fight scenes every 12 minutes.\n\n\n👾 Video games - Playing some\n\nReturn of the Obra Dinn - A murder mystery on a pirate ship\nTwelve Minutes - A murder mystery in your own apartment\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts - One big celebration and one podcast series you should check out.\n\nRecorded\n\n500th Episode of ShopTalk - 🎉\nAn HTML Select element that is… actually styleable - Chris and I look at the new <selectmenu> prototype built by some folks in Open UI.\n\n\nListened\n\nScene on Radio S4: The Land That Never Has Been Yet - I had to pick my jaw up off the floor as I learned, for the first time, about some of the racist and oligarchic systems embedded in the founding of America that still impact our country today.\n\n\n\n\n📝 Blogging - Some observational posts and a “shitty sci-fi” post which I plan on doing more of.\n\nHTML is general, ARIA is specific - Observational tech blogging.

I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.\n\n2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent) - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.\n2022: Be less disgusting - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.\n\nAnd for grown-ups, I got another one.\n\n2022: Buy your happiness - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.\n\nI hate how consumerist that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!\nEpisode 500 of ShopTalk\nI wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.\nAnd celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.\nI built my first Gunpla\n\nOn a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.\nMaking my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.\nI have a new ergonomic keyboard to build, a book of Frank Lloyd Wright kirigami papercraft models, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.\nAnother big refactor on Luro\nOne of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on Luro. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a tech de jour it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.\ntl;dr— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with boring technology, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.\nStatistics\nBecause I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.\n\n💪 Fitness - Closed my rings 5 days this month\n\nBack doing Apple Fitness\nBack doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off\n\n\n📖 Reading\n\nPeril - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books? You base content heirarchy on what’s before and what’s after?\nViolence. Speed. Momentum. - The Dr. Disrespect origin story. 100% toxic action figure masculinity and 100% YAYAYAYAYAYA.\nApocalyptiGirl - I enjoyed this simple post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi.\nHead Lopper Vol 4 - Possibly my least favorite Head Lopper, but still Head Lopper so it’s weird and good.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime - Got COVID, so I had time to watch some shows.\n\nFoundation (AppleTV) - A sci-fi story based on the books by Isaac Asimov. The story lines are a bit drummed up but it makes for better TV.\nKomi Can’t Communicate (Netflix) - A shonen story about a boy helping a classmate who has a fear of talking. The supporting cast helps carry the show.\nNew Game (Crunchyroll) - A show about new situation anxiety centered around a recent high school graduate joining a game studio.\nGundam I (Netflix) - 13 TV episodes smashed into one long movie with fight scenes every 12 minutes.\n\n\n👾 Video games - Playing some\n\nReturn of the Obra Dinn - A murder mystery on a pirate ship\nTwelve Minutes - A murder mystery in your own apartment\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts - One big celebration and one podcast series you should check out.\n\nRecorded\n\n500th Episode of ShopTalk - 🎉\nAn HTML Select element that is… actually styleable - Chris and I look at the new <selectmenu> prototype built by some folks in Open UI.\n\n\nListened\n\nScene on Radio S4: The Land That Never Has Been Yet - I had to pick my jaw up off the floor as I learned, for the first time, about some of the racist and oligarchic systems embedded in the founding of America that still impact our country today.\n\n\n\n\n📝 Blogging - Some observational posts and a “shitty sci-fi” post which I plan on doing more of.\n\nHTML is general, ARIA is specific - Observational tech blogging. Mixed feedback on this, not sure if I explained it the best, so I’ll keep exploring.\nThe man playing the ukulele at the doctor’s office. - Observational blogging\nThe Vacation - A short sci-fi story based on my lament that everything costs money these days.\nFive Hundred ShopTalks - A celebration of 10 years of podcasting\n\n\n🤖 Crafts\n\nBandai Entry Grade Mobile Suit Gundam RX-78-2\n\n\n",

      "summary": "Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.\nIt’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handful of series that capture snapshots of the industry which I find offer up a neat vantage point of “what’s happening now” from tons of different voices. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to gain perspectives outside my own.\nI’m lucky enough to have worked on some cool projects (I once made the Microsoft.com homepage in my spare bedroom), but ShopTalk stands out as a distinct career highlight due to its consistency over time. On a hard drive somewhere I have a graveyard of abandoned side projects, apps, podcasts, and games… yet ShopTalk still stands. We log in every week and do it. Hopefully, getting a smidge better every time. Not all projects need to go 10+ years — and that’s something I still need to learn, it’s okay for them to go away, they can and should change — but it’s rewarding when you’re still having fun doing the thing you started doing so long ago. Fine wine, yadda yadda.\nLessons learned\nThe biggest lesson I’ve learned about podcasting over the last 10 years: it’s all about consistency and quality. Releasing on a consistent day/week/etc (whatever that is for your show) and making sure the show you send to people’s earbuds and cars is a good quality audio file; that means good mic, good edit, decent music and audio cues.\nFor your podcast or (in more contemporary parlance) your livestream focus on finding one easy thing that can boost your quality. I’m a firm believer in the 80:20 rule, there’s often a trick you can do that makes your thing 80% better with 20% of the effort. Often that’s a microphone or learning proper mic technique. Figure it out for your situation, it’s worth it.\nThe other thing Chris and I talk about often is that whenever we’ve needed to make a decision we’ve always sided on making our lives easier and we have no regrets. This allows us to continue to enjoy the podcasting with less stress. For example, I use a USB mic with no audio interface, because easier. We don’t do high concept shows that often, because easier. We don’t typically have more than two guests, because easier. We pay an audio editor, because easier. “Easier” has been a good compass for us.\nLooking forward\nIt’s tough to predict the future of ShopTalk, but it’s more of the same I think. We flamed out a bit on getting guests lined up during the pandemic but I think there’s energy to get back on track. We’ve invested in our “studio” a bit and are using Riverside.fm to make having guests and capturing quality audio even easier.\nThe biggest change going forward is that we’ve branched out into video over on the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel. Be sure to smash that like button and subscribe. We’ve made ~24 episodes since September which isn’t too shabby for a buncha dads.\nThe final thing is the ShopTalk D-D-D-Discord. We’ve pivoted a smidge from being a broadcast-only podcast to being more of an active community. Lots of friendly folks in there now and because it’s a global chatroom so there’s messages and activity happening from when I wake up to when I go to bed. That’s exciting. There’s a lot more we could be doing (weekly hangouts or whatever) and hope to explore that more going forward.\nAnd lastly,\nThanks to all the people we’ve brought on board to help with the show. First was Aaron Dowd editing, then Chris Enns took over at the audio editor helm, the folks at BuySellAds helping sell ads, Tina Pham at Pham Transcription Services, Miranda Mulligan for helping us with the books, Chris Taylor for the theme songs, the D-D-D-Discord for inspiration, WordPress devs and plugin authors who have helped work on the site, and countless guests who have let us pick their brains over the years. Thanks to everyone who has helped out.\nThank you, dear listener, for downloading ShopTalk in your podcatcher of choice. It means a lot to me that you’d take the time to listen, even once. Thank you.

      "summary": "It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nTwitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.\nI mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click > Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.\nOk. Whatever. Then Twitter’s implementation took it a step further and when you add your NFT as a pfp (which you could do before), it added a hexagonal clipping mask to NFT profile pictures.

They’re great to look back on and for rounding up miscellaneous thoughts.\nGetting diagnosed with skin cancer and having it removed with Mohs surgery was a big emotional part of the year. I describe it as “ambient stress”, a whiny noise in the background that you try not to pay attention but is affecting your mood. I’m a post-processor so I’m sure it’ll be a bit before that all sinks in. But the general health of my personhood is at the forefront of my mind.\nBooks and social media\nI picked up 40 books this year, down from ~80 last year. A lot of the books and facts in similar genres started repeating themselves. I may have exhausted some of the self-help and popular science genres, it’s all rehashed Malcom Gladwell at some point. Losing steam, I paused on audiobooks and plowed thru podcast arcs instead. Those are fun and immersive. I think next year I’m going to try more paper books and sci-fi.\nMedia-wise, I broke up with Twitter and deleted it from my phone and iPad. Had a fling with TikTok but that too felt like wasting time. Now my phone is boring. I spent a good amount of time clearing out RSS and podcatcher feeds were my mainstays towards the end of the year.\nWork and health\nI worked on some cool projects this year like a Covid response dashboard for the CDC of Africa, I got to collab with the fine folks at Happy Cog which felt like a childhood dream come true, and I even made progress on building a product with Paravel — but I’m exhausted. Professionally fulfilled, but exhausted. Can’t remember a single “slow” week. This sounds dour, but it’s sort of how it works out running and starting your own company. I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.\nI’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority. And to make a priority I think that needs to a part of my main priority (work) in some way. The plan is to trick my brain into thinking that fitness is part of my job.\nSome goals\nPlucking some goals for next year…\n\nMake my personal health part of my job\nRead 40 books, at least 10 paper books and 10 sci-fi books\nFigure out what truly relaxes me\n\nYeah. I’m doing goals again. Feel free to ask me about ‘em.",

      "title": "Sustaining Maintaining",
      "summary": "You see it all the time; a repo with a thousand issues, a hundred open PRs, a thousand forks. v2.0 is on the way but there’s no clear roadmap or communication. Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.\nThe critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.\nFor every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.\nIt would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.\nBut financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source & Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”\n\nFrom the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.\nTowards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:\n\nWith the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.\n\n“Burnout”. There’s the word.\nI sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.\nIf I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:\n\nDifferentiating between support requests and Issues\nIssue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)\nHow to handle volume without losing your soul\nLanding pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)\nSetting up testing and continuous integration\nHow to get Sponsors\nHow and why to use Discussions\nHow and why to use Projects and Milestones\nHow to write good documentation\nSetting boundaries and office hours\nEffective and clear communication\nChoosing an open source business model\n\nOr what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.\nI think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.\nThere’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.\nThese are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t? My weary soul wants to know.",

      "content_text": "You see it all the time; a repo with a thousand issues, a hundred open PRs, a thousand forks. v2.0 is on the way but there’s no clear roadmap or communication. Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.\nThe critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.\nFor every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.\nIt would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.\nBut financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source & Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”\n\nFrom the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.\nTowards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:\n\nWith the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.\n\n“Burnout”. There’s the word.\nI sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.\nIf I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:\n\nDifferentiating between support requests and Issues\nIssue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)\nHow to handle volume without losing your soul\nLanding pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)\nSetting up testing and continuous integration\nHow to get Sponsors\nHow and why to use Discussions\nHow and why to use Projects and Milestones\nHow to write good documentation\nSetting boundaries and office hours\nEffective and clear communication\nChoosing an open source business model\n\nOr what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.\nI think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.\nThere’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.\nThese are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t?

      "summary": "On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.\nEarlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outage. The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an undefined function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.\nSpeaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret. It’s called Luro and we think you’ll love it. Before we open the doors, we need to let it bake a bit more with our first cohort of beta testing customers.

I’m enchanted by the idea of running a one-shot and may try to put one together in one of my Discords.

It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:\n\nnerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality\nbuff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality\nsalty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.\ntoxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.\ntilted - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.\nmeta - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.\nmeta shift - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.\nmental - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.\nchalked - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.\nblender - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”\ngame sense - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions\npsychic damage - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&D)\n\nThrough gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be tilted. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.\nTaking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, salty, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a blender helps let the psychic damage roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.\nThe concept of meta shifts is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.\nCooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage.

      "title": "Blogtober",
      "summary": "Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.\nI needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.\nI hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.\nGoodbye Grandma Jeanne\nMy wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.\nShe was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.\nI never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.\nThe case of the ill-fitting jacket\nWhile trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.\nThat… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.\nThus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.\nAutumnal Camping\nIn the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.\nWe are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.\nStarting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂\nBusiness-wise\nBusiness-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.\nStats-based Vibe Gamification\n\n📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.\nThe Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.\nArtemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.\nMonumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction. This is a story I hadn’t heard and needs to be retold more often. The problems then mirror our problems today. If it were not for Dunn’s untimely death, America might be a different place.\n\n\n📝 Blogging: Blogtober was a success.\n\nWhy don’t video games take sex seriously?\nMy Retirement Seminar\nHTML with Superpowers 20K hits!\n🎨 Alpha Paintlet\nLet’s talk about Native HTML Tabs\nThe mistake every new game developer makes\nMy pre-publish blogging rituals\nHolding Beef 🥩\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Obvs not doing enough here. Pickleball is great tho.\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes: Another good month for content. 8 videos for ShopTalk Video, 4 audio episodes of ShopTalk, and 2 episodes of Aside Quest, and 1 guest appearance.\n\nShopTalk Videos\n\nBreakin’ Up CSS Custom Properties\nUse Alpha Transparency on Any Color in CSS with a (tiny) Paint Worklet\nA Quick Cloudflare Worker with Storage\nSubgrid is All About Inheriting Grid Lines\nDetails Elements Obviously Need a Pizza Arrow\nSpicy Sections\nPlaying with the MD Nichrome Microsite\n\n\nGuest Appearances\n\nI appeared on Enjoy the Vue #77 talking about Petite-Vue\n\n\nI also listened to some good podcasts.\n\nThe Adventure Zone - Ethersea - Dungeons & Dragons in a post-apocalyptic aquatic underworld.

      "content_text": "Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.\nI needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.\nI hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.\nGoodbye Grandma Jeanne\nMy wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.\nShe was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.\nI never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.\nThe case of the ill-fitting jacket\nWhile trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.\nThat… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.\nThus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.\nAutumnal Camping\nIn the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.\nWe are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.\nStarting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂\nBusiness-wise\nBusiness-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.\nStats-based Vibe Gamification\n\n📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.\nThe Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.\nArtemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.\nMonumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction. This is a story I hadn’t heard and needs to be retold more often. The problems then mirror our problems today. If it were not for Dunn’s untimely death, America might be a different place.\n\n\n📝 Blogging: Blogtober was a success.\n\nWhy don’t video games take sex seriously?\nMy Retirement Seminar\nHTML with Superpowers 20K hits!\n🎨 Alpha Paintlet\nLet’s talk about Native HTML Tabs\nThe mistake every new game developer makes\nMy pre-publish blogging rituals\nHolding Beef 🥩\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Obvs not doing enough here.

You watch as Muharrem’s expression moves from confused, to disbelief, to overwhelm. Muharrem tears up, I tear up. Imagine what it must feel like to leave your house and the mismatch you feel every day got erased; the world works for you in a way that it didn’t before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What if…&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if we could do this with the Web. What if… one day everything got better?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/million/&quot;&gt;WebAIM Million Project&lt;/a&gt; scans the top 1,000,000 homepages and runs automated accessibility tests on them. In the report WebAIM identifies six (6) categories of issues that account for 96.5% of the over 50 million detectable errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Low contrast text&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/alt-text/&quot;&gt;Missing alt text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empty links&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Missing form input labels&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empty buttons&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Missing document language&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most shocking revelation is: &lt;strong&gt;All these issues are easy-to-detect and easy-to-fix!&lt;/strong&gt; I believe if we’re all laser focused on these six issues we can make a dent in the WebAIM Million and maybe the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m confident it’ll make a difference. Holly Tuke documented some of her experiences in a post called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/&quot;&gt;5 most annoying website features I face as a blind person every single day&lt;/a&gt;” — her list of issues is nearly the same the WebAIM Million’s list of issues! It’s one data point, but there’s millions out there like Holly who would benefit from even the most basic fixes to your website.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;When?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Accessibility Awareness Day&lt;/strong&gt; (GAAD) this year is on &lt;strong&gt;May 19, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. I can’t think of a better day. That gives you or your company about 6+ weeks to land some minor fixes on your homepages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you visit this in the future, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Accessibility_Awareness_Day&quot;&gt;GAAD is every third Thursday of May&lt;/a&gt;. Roadmap accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to find and detect these issues are to use one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/&quot;&gt;Google Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; (built-in Chrome Web Inspector)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibilityinsights.io/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Accessibility Insights&lt;/a&gt; (browser extension)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They’re both based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/axe/&quot;&gt;Deque’s axe Accessibility Testing Tool&lt;/a&gt; which you can also use. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wave.webaim.org/&quot;&gt;WebAIM’s WAVE&lt;/a&gt; evaluation tool is also great. If you haven’t done this before, there will be lots of errors, but stay focused on the six issues above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to fix the entire web, we’re trying to make a dent. There’s a lot to fix, but I’m a firm believer we need to start somewhere and these six types of issues are –in the nuanced world of accessibility– the easiest to fix. A roadmap of fifty million issues begins with a single step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What do I get out of it?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yikes. Well… You can write a company blog post saying you took part in GAAD. That goes over well. You get some organic traffic. More users can use your website, they’ll buy your goods. Your site won’t be fully WCAG2 compliant, but at least you checked off some of the lowest hanging (&lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.ada.gov/web-guidance/#examples-of-website-accessibility-barriers&quot;&gt;robo-lawyer&lt;/a&gt;) fruit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What if I finished?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Awesome work! Next, identify other core templates of your site and repeat. Think about the whole experience. One thing I heard this weekend was how it’s more frustrating to get to the end of a gigantic flow and an accessibilty error (like unlabelled buttons) prevents you from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said above, your site won’t be fully accessible after this, but I applaud you and your team because you’ve taken a major step on your accessibility journey. You can try your hand at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM4nKEZyOjE&quot;&gt;guided manual tests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://makeitfable.com/accessibility-testing-fable-engage/&quot;&gt;Run user tests&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#professional-testers&quot;&gt;hire a professional&lt;/a&gt; to give you a full audit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Share, translate, commit!&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you’re in. I think we can do it. Six issues in six weeks. Knock them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to make a website about this where people can sign, sponsor, or put logos on it, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to translate this post to your native language, all I ask is you provide a link back to the original here in case information changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 15:04:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/what-if-everything-got-better/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/what-if-everything-got-better/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №15</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;March came and gone. I chased fitness. We went on Spring Break. Growing a business. Baseball games. Failed on blogging. Here is a retelling of the vibes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Closing my rings&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This month I decided I would undergo a challenge to close my rings on my Apple Watch every single day for the whole month and I succeeded!&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;photo-gallery style=&quot;display:grid; gap: 1.5rem; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/rings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iOS Activity app showing a calendar with rings closed every day of March.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/weight.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iOS Health app showing a graph of my weight over time, hovering between 243 pounds and 245 pounds&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/photo-gallery&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say this hasn’t ever happened. My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts. As far as workout programs go, I appreciate the body diversity in Apple Fitness+ — it’s not a bunch of yoga thin hard bodies yelling at me to touch my toes to my ears, it’s real people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Did it make a difference in my weight? No. Not at all. In fact, I weigh a half pound more. My consumption habits were the same, I did nothing extravagant or different. Not much to glean except that I believe this experiment showed me that my weight is not a function of exercise, even 10x my normal exercise doesn’t make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the last month is that I’ve carved a bit of a routine into my life. Made some space for me. I have a good sense of what it takes to close my rings each day and it feels sustainable. I feel more fit, even though no one else would know it from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The late flight to Phoenix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Spring Break we decided to visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Phoenix. Hands down one of the worst flights of my life; a woman too drunk to fly, police to escort her, and her husband (also drunk) deciding to talk back to the police. Per FAA protocol, we all had to deplane to resolve the situation. Another lesson in how much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/03/antisocial-behavior-crime-violence-increase-pandemic/627076/&quot;&gt;the pandemic has effected our ability to function in society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But we got there, sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac for a gate, and arrived at grandma’s house in Phoenix at 3 AM Austin time. Wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The kids had a great visit though. Grandparents and cousins work wonders. Cousins self-propel each other. Pools, sunshine, zoo trips, and more. My wife and I could go on long walks, look at campers, and have a couple margaritas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The “time off” wasn’t as restful as I needed, due in part to some lingering obligations hanging over my head…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Work, talks, and workshops&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a busy but important time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro&lt;/a&gt;. Onboarding new customers but also figuring out next steps in the life of our startup and evaluating a pretty big architectural change (dedicated managed instances → complete multi-tenant application). Lots of discussions and ambient stress. I fried my brain one day doing a cost-benefit analysis on Rails versus Nuxt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adding on to my normal workload, I prepared a talk for An Event Apart and a workshop for Frontend Masters workshop, both on Web Components. It’s been a big year for web components and I’m happy to continue talking about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoy presenting. I feel like it fits within my natural range of extroversion. Talks and workshops are a lot of work though piled on a busy schedule. After years of practice, I feel like I do a decent job estimating the work required and am able to plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidly, the one thing I don’t predict well is the cloud of stress that looms over me a month or so before an event. It’s a looming feeling of excess obligations. As much as I love doing these presentations, they add a lot to a busy schedule and even busier mind. But that impulse to say “no” to future talks conflicts with my impulse to amortize my talks as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;One day without caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I inadvertently attempted a caffeine fast. 10am and I hadn’t had any coffee, so I decided to try it. It did not go well. I was in bed at 4pm with a cursed headache. I went to bed with a headache. I woke up with a headache. I was grumpy, irritable, and almost deleted my whole Twitter account. It took me by surprise how awful my body reacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently 50% of people suffer caffeine withdrawal headaches and it sort of doesn’t matter how much caffeine you have (over 200mg/day). I’m in the unlucky half. I think it’s worthwhile to break chains of addiction when they present themselves, so I may attempt a fast again but may ween myself with half-caf for a bit first before I try again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;💪 &lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closed my rings 31 times.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Didn’t do much pickleball.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🧶 &lt;strong&gt;Crafting&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usagundamstore.com/products/hg-1-144-gundam-ground-urban-combat-type&quot;&gt;Gundam Ground Combat Urban Type&lt;/a&gt; and it may be my most favorite one yet. &lt;a href=&quot;/images/posts/2022/urbancombat.jpg&quot;&gt;Here’s a picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 books + 2 graphic novels\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/141973069X.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/a&gt; - John Lewis’s retelling of America after the Civil Rights Act and his falling out with SNCC.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3hIb2Ir&quot;&gt;The City of Ember&lt;/a&gt; - My son read &lt;em&gt;The City of Ember&lt;/em&gt; for a book report so I read the graphic novel and it’s good.

Great read.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3iKw89K&quot;&gt;What White People Can Do Next&lt;/a&gt; - This one might be controversial, but sort of comes to the conclusion allyship is not the answer 😱  - the crux of the argument is that coalition building is a lot more effective and doesn’t reinforce white savior or victim tropes.

The whole street is concerned about Big Bird. If you ask me, Big Bird is being a bit of a bitch about it all but clearly he’s going through some strong feelings. The ever-graceful Buffy Sainte Marie&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; comes in to share a song with him about the different kinds of love and attention you can give people based on their needs, with the refrain “different people, different ways.” Big Bird seems placated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Different people, different ways” has been a useful parenting tool. It helps us resolve unfairness in moments of sibling rivalry, but also helps in explaining differences of the human condition. Why do they use a wheelchair? Why are they short? Why do they talk like that? Why does that kid get to play with toys in the classroom and I don’t? … Different people, different ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A simple enough refrain that if I start it, my kids will finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ask me in twenty years if it worked, but I think they already get that “fairness” can take different shapes when it’s centered around meeting different people’s different needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I love him 'cause he's tiny and small\nI love you because you're yellow and tall\nTiny and small love\nYellow and tall love\nEveryone loves through all their days\nDifferent people, different ways\n\nI love him 'cause he has to be fed\nI love you because you make your own bed\nHe has to be fed love\nYou make your own bed love\nDifferent people, different ways\n\nI love him 'cause he's small and helpless\nHe has to be washed and fed each day\nI love you cause you're big and helpful\nYou can read, sing, and play\n\nI love him 'cause he's sugar and spice\nI love you because you're awfully nice\nSugar and spice love\nAwfully nice love\nTiny and small love\nYellow and tall love\nEveryone loves through all their days\nDifferent people, different ways\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Buffy Sainte Marie once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RwZW2j3-U&quot;&gt;once breastfed Cody on Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; in a time when breastfeeding, let alone public breastfeeding, was socially unpopular.

Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/goodbye-big-freeda/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/goodbye-big-freeda/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №14</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Survived the freeze&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Texas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Sold the pop-up&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/camper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2010 Rockwood Freedom popup camper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over Valentine’s weekend, we tried to go camping with our friends, but the pop-up… didn’t… pop-up. We abandoned it at the campsite overnight and drove it to the RV lot the next day where we sold it for next to nothing. We could have put money into it and potentially sold it for more, but we needed out. It cost us ~$500 in maintenance every time we wanted to take it out and that caused me more stress than relaxation. Lots of memories, but a new chapter in camping begins… but not jumping back into the camper ownership game too soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Gunpla and mechanical keyboard crafting&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I made two crafts this month that I’m pleased with, but also some mixed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/heavyarms.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gundam Heavyarms 4.5” plastic model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Gundam but with extra guns, the XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms. This was my first High Grade (HG) 1/144th scale gunpla. It’s a cool model with lots of expression but I was initially a bit disappointed by a wobbly waist and a leg that kept falling off. Between meetings one day I decided to rebuild the legs, found the place where I messed up, and now it’s sturdy-gurdy and much more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I bought another HG model I plan on doing but am feeling the itch to go up to a Master Grade (MG) 1/100th scale model. In the meantime, I’m going to try my hand at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95MD5IXiXqE&quot;&gt;panel lining&lt;/a&gt; (I bought ~$30 worth of markers!) to add some depth to my current models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;KBDfans Mountain Ergo&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/mountain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alice-like ergonomic keyboard, split layout tented&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On an impulse I bought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kbdfans.com/products/ic-kbdfans-mountain-ergo-keyboard-kit&quot;&gt;KBDfans Mountain Ergo keyboard kit&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an Alice-like layout (split, but staggard layout) but the tented chassis makes it a bit more ergonomic. ~$500 is a lot for a keyboard, but I regretted missing the group buy, so I impulsively bought it when restock units went on sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Such a satisfying build. The sandwiched base-plate layers, the snap and click as switches lock in to the hotswappable circuit board, and thocky keypresses of lubed stabilizers. Finished off with a (cheap) set of all-white Japanese hiragana keycaps. It’s an absolute unit and weighs more than a newborn child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I may post a more in-depth review, but as good and beautiful as this keyboard is… I like my Moonlander better? Or I had the Moonlander tuned a bit more ergonomically for me? It’s nice to type on though, but I think my problems are more related to 60% keyboard layouts being suboptimal for development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Frontend Masters Web Components Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most February evenings went to putting together a Web Components course for &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/&quot;&gt;Frontend Masters&lt;/a&gt;. I planned the workshop, made a website, and got feedback from friends in the ShopTalk Discord. Workshops aren’t my forté, but it’s coming together and feels good to be ahead of schedule rather than scrambling as the deadline approaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m also updating my web component talk for &lt;a href=&quot;https://aneventapart.com/event/spring-summit-2022&quot;&gt;An Event Apart: Spring Summit&lt;/a&gt;, so all the web component research parlays together nicely. There’s a sense of accomplishment in having turned a talk into a workshop and a website. Who knows what’s next, a book? A graphic novel? A movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Luro 📈&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another great month of progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro&lt;/a&gt;. We began onboarding our first customer which brought up a lot of major and minor issues with the application, nearly tripling the number of issues in the backlog. Expected, of course, but it triggered a need for better issue management (projects, labels, etc) and taking time to triage incoming issues rather than letting them remain in memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We went with GitHub’s new beta Projects feature. With Projects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/06/log-jams/&quot;&gt;I can view the board in a handful of dimensions&lt;/a&gt; instead of only a reverse chronological list. It’s been helpful for prioritizing issues and grouping work. The issue queue is nearly back down to pre-flood levels, but we may need some dedicated help soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has occupied a lot of my heart and worried brain. There’s a lot to say on this but to watch a tiny tyrant amass hundreds of thousands of troops, lie so brazenly, threaten nuclear war, bomb innocent civilians, all in an attempt to seize a country by force… and there’s so little we can do to stop it… it’s heart-wrenching. As I heard someone say, the ultimate outcome of this war — the great costs paid — depends entirely on a single autocrat coming to his senses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to all those who are victims of an unjust war.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;High-level recap of some stat-based metrics&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;💪 &lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closed my rings 7 times.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skill cap problems at Pickleball, a lot of 3.5/4.0+ tennis players have showed up and losing every point makes Pickleball less fun. “Git gud”, I guess or… no.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; - I read two books this month that touch on similar topics, but I liked one and hated the other. The juxtaposition helped me realize what kind of non-fiction books I like; those that tend to be more academic and/or written by people with PhDs.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/36sqSEP&quot;&gt;Everything is Figureoutable&lt;/a&gt; - This book comes highly recommended but I did not enjoy it. I agree with the premise, that you can figure out most problems, but the narrative frustrated me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3s3mvsg&quot;&gt;The Upside of Stress&lt;/a&gt; - This was my kind of book. Correcting old science with new science, adjacent scientific studies. Written by a PhD. I welcome the challenge to the societal mindset that stress kills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📺 &lt;strong&gt;TV, Movies, and Anime&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gundam II, Gundam III (Netflix)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;👾 &lt;strong&gt;Video games&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://olliolliworld.live/&quot;&gt;Olli Olli World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🎙 &lt;strong&gt;Podcasts and YouTubes&lt;/strong&gt; - We moved ShopTalk over to its own YouTube channel. It’s a minor but impactful change that will allow all ShopTalk content to exist in one home.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0z_y1EirBhSQN96P4foZ1A&quot;&gt;New ShopTalk YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt; - Like and subscribe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/video/css-quiz-show/&quot;&gt;CSS Quiz Show&lt;/a&gt; - Chris and I did a couple of CSS quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📝 &lt;strong&gt;Blogging&lt;/strong&gt; - 6 posts, 3 new formats. I started doing end-of-week link roundups, a blogging series where I pretend I’m dying or about to quit tech, and a “songcatching” series where I share meaningful songs.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/friday-links-1/&quot;&gt;Five links for a Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/complaining-about-web-browsers/&quot;&gt;Before I go: When it comes to complaining about web browsers&lt;/a&gt; - Highest traffic post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/week-links-2/&quot;&gt;Six end of week links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/been-in-this-war-for-too-long/&quot;&gt;Been in this war for too long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/&quot;&gt;Τ’ακορντεόν&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/03/genbaku-o-yurusumaji/&quot;&gt;原爆を許すまじ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also… the ShopTalk Discord braintrust and I have determined that I need to redesign my website. Let it be recorded in the annals of time that process has begun.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 01:21:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/vibe-check-14/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/vibe-check-14/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>The 15 minute fix vs the 30 day fix</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The 15 minute fix&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The 15 minute fix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The 30 day fix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Example: The case of the evolving API needs&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I built an API to retrieve &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of &lt;code&gt;post.title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post.id&lt;/code&gt; fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then we needed to have a category filter on the &lt;code&gt;/posts/lists&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these &lt;code&gt;/posts/list/:category&lt;/code&gt; queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a &lt;code&gt;limit&lt;/code&gt; as a query param.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ahh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need &lt;code&gt;orderBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;groupBy&lt;/code&gt; params for sorting, &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; params for an ad-hoc &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; of related records, ability to sort &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; records; a little less rigidity in the design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation. With all the added options, the &lt;code&gt;/posts/list&lt;/code&gt; endpoint is a mess — it may not even need to exist! — and we could solve a lot of problems by sitting down and thinking about the solution a little bit harder. But I actually don’t know if we made a mistake. We were running towards getting feedback. We don’t need a big infrastructure project when sandbags would fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;To build or over-build, that is the question&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough situation that comes down to estimating. Not estimating in a “choose some fake fibonacci numbers” sense, but in an overcoming personal biases sense. Are you over-estimating your need for the 30 day fix? Are you under-estimating how well the 15 minute fix is going to work? Are you operating emotionally out of a bad experience from a previous situation? Have you overcome your personal optimism bias? What’s the pressure from management like?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Often you don’t know the scope of the problem until you have users, so over-building at the beginning of the process is probably a mistake. The 15 minute fix gets you closer to actually learning what your codebase needs. But months down the line, you have a codebase full of 15 minute fixes that now need 30 day upgrades. Time-bombs. Could you have saved time by architecting the 30 day fix from the beginning? Or could you have saved a lot of money by chipping away at the problem with more and more 15 minute fixes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that’s what it comes down to: economics. A 15 minute fix and a 30 day fix have colossally different costs and impacts. Can your business afford that time? Can your users afford the delay? Is it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexsexton.com/blog/2014/11/the-monty-hall-rewrite/&quot;&gt;Monty Hall Rewrite&lt;/a&gt; problem where the fix could actually be worse once it’s landed? I struggle with this because I hate rework, but if you think of software as evolving, then rework and maintenance is part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How do you decide? I don’t know. The best advice I have is: &lt;strong&gt;Never go to the grocery store when you’re hungry&lt;/strong&gt;… but y’know, for software.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 19:27:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/15-minute-fix-vs-30-day-fix/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/15-minute-fix-vs-30-day-fix/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>原爆を許すまじ</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkUciYATc8o&quot;&gt;Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Born in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zq9pXGShrHk&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/genbaku-o-yurusumaji/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/genbaku-o-yurusumaji/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Τ’ακορντεόν</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;“The Accordion” (&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot;&gt;Τ’ ακορντεόν&lt;/span&gt;) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot;&gt;Μάνος Λοΐζος&lt;/span&gt;) in 1967 while Greece was under &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_junta&quot;&gt;far-right military junta control&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I first heard this song on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/americas/panama-hotel-trump.html&quot;&gt;a news story about Orestes Fintiklis&lt;/a&gt;. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LPMwsi400s&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;el&quot;&gt;\nΣτη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο\nπου ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν\nόταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος\nφωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΜα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα\nκράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν\nφασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα\nκαι μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΤ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει\nόποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν\nκι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει\nδε θα περάσει ο φασισμός\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\nIn my old neighborhood I had a friend\nwho knew and played the accordion\nwhen he sang, he was like the sun\nfires in his hands ignited by the accordion\n\nBut at one dark night, like every other night\nhe kept a look-out playing the accordion\nfascist trucks stood in the paddock\nand a gun shot stopped the accordion\n\nThe started slogan comes back to me\nwhenever I hear an accordion\nand it has marked my life like a stamp\n'Fascism will not prevail!'\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Been in this war for too long</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, across the world, humans have shared their culture with others through song.
