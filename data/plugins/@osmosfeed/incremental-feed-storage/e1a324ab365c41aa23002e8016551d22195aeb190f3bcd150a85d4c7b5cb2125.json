Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a <div> or a <span> but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?\nAll good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.\nWhat struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology.

The mantra for the year was “No goals, only vibes” and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.\nSome highlights include:\n\n🙁 Started the year in Stage 5 Covid\n😃 Paid off our car!\n🙁🙁🙁 Witnessed an insurrection\n😢 Lost my grandma Joyce\n😃 Started a ShopTalk Discord\n😃😃😃 Got a new backyard office shed\n🥶🥶🥶 Lost power for 75 hours during the Texas Freeze\n😃 Spoke on Accessibility Backlogs at axe-con\n😢 Lost my aunt Renee\n😃 Got vaccinated\n😃 Spoke on Web Components at An Event Apart\n🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my camper fixed\n😃 Turned 41\n😐 Went river camping, but camper broke\n😃 Beach camped on a Texas beach\n😃😃😃 Rupert family reunion with white water rafting and hiking in Colorado\n🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my car fixed (the one I paid off)\n😃 Worked with Open UI on Spicy Sections (aka, tabs)\n😃😃 Started playing pickle ball\n😃 Kids went back to school\n😃😃😃 Building a product called Luro with my compadres at Paravel\n😃😃😃 Started making ShopTalk YouTubes with Chris\n😃 More camping with friends\n😃 Blogtober’d\n😢 Lost great grandma Jeanne\n🙁🙁🙁 Got skin cancer\n🙁🙁🙁 Got Mohs surgery\n😐 Healed\n😢 Lost great grandpa Ed\n😵‍💫😵‍💫 Drove across America (twice)\n😃😃😃 Saw my family for the holidays\n😐 Ending the year in Stage 4 Covid\n\n… and those are more or less the emotional beats in my story of last year. It’s been a year. Ups and downs. A big change for me and for this blog was that I documented it all in my monthly Vibe Checks. That was successful and enjoyable so I plan on continuing those. They’re great to look back on and for rounding up miscellaneous thoughts.\nGetting diagnosed with skin cancer and having it removed with Mohs surgery was a big emotional part of the year. I describe it as “ambient stress”, a whiny noise in the background that you try not to pay attention but is affecting your mood. I’m a post-processor so I’m sure it’ll be a bit before that all sinks in. But the general health of my personhood is at the forefront of my mind.\nBooks and social media\nI picked up 40 books this year, down from ~80 last year. A lot of the books and facts in similar genres started repeating themselves. I may have exhausted some of the self-help and popular science genres, it’s all rehashed Malcom Gladwell at some point. Losing steam, I paused on audiobooks and plowed thru podcast arcs instead. Those are fun and immersive. I think next year I’m going to try more paper books and sci-fi.\nMedia-wise, I broke up with Twitter and deleted it from my phone and iPad. Had a fling with TikTok but that too felt like wasting time. Now my phone is boring. I spent a good amount of time clearing out RSS and podcatcher feeds were my mainstays towards the end of the year.\nWork and health\nI worked on some cool projects this year like a Covid response dashboard for the CDC of Africa, I got to collab with the fine folks at Happy Cog which felt like a childhood dream come true, and I even made progress on building a product with Paravel — but I’m exhausted. Professionally fulfilled, but exhausted. Can’t remember a single “slow” week. This sounds dour, but it’s sort of how it works out running and starting your own company. I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.\nI’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority. And to make a priority I think that needs to a part of my main priority (work) in some way. The plan is to trick my brain into thinking that fitness is part of my job.\nSome goals\nPlucking some goals for next year…\n\nMake my personal health part of my job\nRead 40 books, at least 10 paper books and 10 sci-fi books\nFigure out what truly relaxes me\n\nYeah.

End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.\nBut we made it.\nThe minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained. This happens every year, to the extent that my wife’s family used to think I was faking a sickness to avoid them, but no, I actually like them, it’s my body giving up when work stops.\nIt’s weird.\nChristmas this year was an interstate affair. After realizing flights cost $3200, we resolved to drive to Nebraska to celebrate with my family this year. It’s about ~1000 miles each way. The payoff is seeing my enormous divorced family, brother and step-brothers and their wives, aunts, uncles, cousins, their kids, and 11 of my 23 nieces and nephews. There’s something special about kids playing with their cousins, calling the same people grandma and grandpa has magical properties. Endless screaming, yelling, video games, and snowy mountains of Ready Whip sprayed atop mini-waffles.\nGood times.\nHauling Christmas across America isn’t my favorite thing, by air or by land. But driving across America is a neat rite of passage and it’s also the thing that will make me run for public office so we can get some bullet trains in this god forsaken country. Seeing family and celebrating the great magical fat norseman are special times, but I don’t feel super “restored” coming back from vacation.\nLord, I’m tired. I’m weak. I’m worn.\n\n\n🚙 Drove: 1,890+ miles\n📖 Reading\n\nDisciplined Entrepreneurship - A quick and easy startup bootcamp with a 24 step process. A good listen, but probably need the actual book for visualizations to hit hard.\nSaving Capitalism - Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and I get upset about the same issues. This book outlines some of the structural problems in regards to wealth generation in our capitalistic democracy.\nProject Hail Mary - Science’ing shit in space. Another wonderful page-turner book by Andy Weir.\n\n\n📝 Blogging - I wrote a lot but published little.\n\nSustaining Maintaining - a thinkpiece about how there’s little education in open source beyond setting up repos and installing CI/CD; without education everyone learns the hard way, leading to burnout.\nFive good feelings - a short dissertation about books\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes\n\nShop Talk is inching closer to Episode 500\nI took part in the Frontend Horse Holiday Snowtacular where we raised money for TeamSeas to remove over 5 tons of trash from the ocean. I talked about blogs. Brief but fun.\nYouTubes - After a month break due to surgery and general busy-ness, ShopTalk managed to cut two episodes.\n\nAstro - 20 minutes of playing with Astro, I used a VTuber skin because my nose was still fucked up.\nPlay video onscroll - Intersection Observers and the HTML Media Element API, sorta my wheelhouse.\n\n\nListened\n\nRabbit Hole - a NYT investigation into algorithmic radicalization (YouTube, Facebook, etc). A must listen, IMO.\n\n\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Not successful\n",

      "summary": "You see it all the time; a repo with a thousand issues, a hundred open PRs, a thousand forks. v2.0 is on the way but there’s no clear roadmap or communication. Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.\nThe critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.\nFor every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.\nIt would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.\nBut financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source & Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”\n\nFrom the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.\nTowards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:\n\nWith the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.\n\n“Burnout”. There’s the word.\nI sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.\nIf I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:\n\nDifferentiating between support requests and Issues\nIssue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)\nHow to handle volume without losing your soul\nLanding pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)\nSetting up testing and continuous integration\nHow to get Sponsors\nHow and why to use Discussions\nHow and why to use Projects and Milestones\nHow to write good documentation\nSetting boundaries and office hours\nEffective and clear communication\nChoosing an open source business model\n\nOr what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.\nI think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.\nThere’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.\nThese are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t?

      "summary": "On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.\nEarlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outage. The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an undefined function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.\nSpeaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret. It’s called Luro and we think you’ll love it. Before we open the doors, we need to let it bake a bit more with our first cohort of beta testing customers. Then we’ll have more to talk about and show.\nOther vibes\nI spent a lot of mental energy learning and establishing my thoughts about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs this month. Some of that thinking leaked out on Shop Talk Show #490. I think I’m out for now. There’s a lot to say. Solving ledger-like problems seems okay. DAOs are (probably unenforcable, but) interesting. But truly, nothing compelling other than FOMO right now. Money charts going up is cool and produces a great amount of envy, but I read a lot, listened to a lot of podcasts, challenged myself to be open-minded and not old man yells at cloud, yet … I can’t. And that’s where I’m at on that, for now at least.\nAll the Web3 hype (as well as Politics Twitter) actually made me uninstall Twitter from my iPad and iPhone… and I kind of love it. I’m unplugged from the outrage machine and it’s much quieter. Stomping the urge to reinstall the app or log in from Mobile Safari for some dumb tweet is the hardest part, but I’m so far successful.\nWith time to kill, I spent a lot of time watching TikToks and roleplaying videos, both popular DnD5E series (like Critical Role (Campaign 3), Battle for Beyond, The Adventure Zone: Imbalance) and for one-shots systems like Lasers and Feelings. I’m enchanted by the idea of running a one-shot and may try to put one together in one of my Discords. But for now I’ll live vicariously through watching videos and pretend I’m pretending… wait.\nI’m even starting to think about making a video game again…\nStats\n\n📖 Reading: Opted for podcasts over audiobooks this month, but still managed to squeeze in three books.\n\nThe Bomber Mafia - Continuing my quest to read all the Malcom Gladwell novels. This book was a bit dull, but the theme around “Is there an ethical way to bomb during war?” and the exploration of that theme was interesting enough to sustain me.\nThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team - A business classic! An interesting look at how different personalities and attitudes can impact a team.\nEffortless - Another good, thought-provoking book by Greg McKeown. “How do you not feel overwhelmed even when you become an essentialist?” McKeown shares some strategies for creating “effortless” work. Not 100% practical, but challenging at least.\n\n\n📝 Blogging: Did not ride the blogging train into November as I hoped, but it’s fine, I watched TikToks instead.\n\nGaming improved my EQ\nStatus Performance Analysis in Team Fortress 2\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Mild setback as I may have injured a butt cheek swinging a pickaxe while clearing the nandina out of the side yard with my neighbor.\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes: Released a normal amount of podcasts. Shop Talk is careening towards Episode 500 (which we’ll hit next year).\n\nReleased 4 Shop Talk Videos:\n\nPlaying with the MD Nichrome Microsite\nRandom Grids\nKnobs\nVideoPress\n\n\nListens: Cleared out some podcast series I had lingering in the old queue.\n\nThe Adventure Zone: Ethersea - I love this universe.\nClearleft Podcast (Season 2 + 3) - An remarkable industry podcast. Incredible editing and incredible guests. It covers a lot of burgeoning design/UX concerns and constantly asks “How can we do X better?”\nWolverine: The Lost Trail (Season 2) - Logan runs from Weapon X, blah blah, not as good as the first season, but entertaining and I love the old-timey serial radio show vibe.\n\n\n\n\n⌨️ Open Source: Reviewed a PRs for <spicy-sections>\n⚖️ Budgeting: Actually started looking at this today.

It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:\n\nnerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality\nbuff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality\nsalty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.\ntoxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.\ntilted - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.\nmeta - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.\nmeta shift - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.\nmental - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.\nchalked - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.\nblender - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”\ngame sense - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions\npsychic damage - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&D)\n\nThrough gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be tilted. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.\nTaking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, salty, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a blender helps let the psychic damage roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.\nThe concept of meta shifts is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.\nCooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage. There’s not one uniform metric for success, if you measure solely on damage dealt that skews the reality of how success happens.\nBringing this full circle, even your worst performing player — who it would be easy to throw under the bus — might be adding immeasurable value…\nA message to the worst one on the team... pic.twitter.com/pJIuaTE5Mc— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) January 13, 2021 \nAdding value as “the anchor”.

      "content_text": "Gamers aren’t known for being the most intelligent people around…\nOh no Tim... 🌎@timthetatman pic.twitter.com/njLv2c59Jy— Wipz (@Wipz) July 29, 2020 \nWhile IQ may be at an all time low, I think there’s actually a wealth of emotional intelligence (EQ) within competitive gaming. It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:\n\nnerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality\nbuff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality\nsalty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.\ntoxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.\ntilted - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.\nmeta - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.\nmeta shift - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.\nmental - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.\nchalked - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.\nblender - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”\ngame sense - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions\npsychic damage - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&D)\n\nThrough gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be tilted. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.\nTaking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, salty, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a blender helps let the psychic damage roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.\nThe concept of meta shifts is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.\nCooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage. There’s not one uniform metric for success, if you measure solely on damage dealt that skews the reality of how success happens.\nBringing this full circle, even your worst performing player — who it would be easy to throw under the bus — might be adding immeasurable value…\nA message to the worst one on the team... pic.twitter.com/pJIuaTE5Mc— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) January 13, 2021 \nAdding value as “the anchor”.

      "summary": "Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.\nI needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.\nI hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.\nGoodbye Grandma Jeanne\nMy wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.\nShe was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.\nI never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.\nThe case of the ill-fitting jacket\nWhile trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.\nThat… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.\nThus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.\nAutumnal Camping\nIn the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.\nWe are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.\nStarting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂\nBusiness-wise\nBusiness-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.\nStats-based Vibe Gamification\n\n📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.\nThe Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.\nArtemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.\nMonumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction.

Semantically, that’s a lot like a &lt;em&gt;non-modal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt;, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a &lt;code&gt;listbox&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tooltip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;combobox&lt;/code&gt;, etc. which are not a &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt; and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt;? Or should it be nothing like a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is &lt;code&gt;display: popup&lt;/code&gt; the best primitive here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Sure, that can be a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:09:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/01/html-is-general-aria-is-specific/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/01/html-is-general-aria-is-specific/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Twenty Twentyone</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you quantify a whole year? I’ve attempted it before and this one is different because I didn’t set out to achieve anything. The mantra for the year was “&lt;strong&gt;No goals, only vibes”&lt;/strong&gt; and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁 Started the year in Stage 5 Covid&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Paid off our car!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁🙁🙁 Witnessed an insurrection&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost my grandma Joyce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Started a ShopTalk Discord&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Got a new backyard office shed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🥶🥶🥶 Lost power for 75 hours during the Texas Freeze&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Spoke on Accessibility Backlogs at axe-con&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost my aunt Renee&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Got vaccinated&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Spoke on Web Components at An Event Apart&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my camper fixed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Turned 41&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😐 Went river camping, but camper broke&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Beach camped on a Texas beach&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Rupert family reunion with white water rafting and hiking in Colorado&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my car fixed (the one I paid off)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Worked with Open UI on Spicy Sections (aka, tabs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃 Started playing pickle ball&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Kids went back to school&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Building a product called Luro with my compadres at Paravel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Started making ShopTalk YouTubes with Chris&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 More camping with friends&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Blogtober’d&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost great grandma Jeanne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁🙁🙁 Got skin cancer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁🙁🙁 Got Mohs surgery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😐 Healed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost great grandpa Ed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😵‍💫😵‍💫 Drove across America (twice)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Saw my family for the holidays&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😐 Ending the year in Stage 4 Covid&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;… and those are more or less the emotional beats in my story of last year. It’s been a year. Ups and downs. A big change for me and for this blog was that I documented it all in my monthly Vibe Checks. That was successful and enjoyable so I plan on continuing those. They’re great to look back on and for rounding up miscellaneous thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Getting diagnosed with skin cancer and having it removed with Mohs surgery was a big emotional part of the year. I describe it as “ambient stress”, a whiny noise in the background that you try not to pay attention but is affecting your mood. I’m a post-processor so I’m sure it’ll be a bit before that all sinks in. But the general health of my personhood is at the forefront of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Books and social media&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up 40 books this year, down from ~80 last year. A lot of the books and facts in similar genres started repeating themselves. I may have exhausted some of the self-help and popular science genres, it’s all rehashed Malcom Gladwell at some point. Losing steam, I paused on audiobooks and plowed thru podcast arcs instead. Those are fun and immersive. I think next year I’m going to try more paper books and sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Media-wise, I broke up with Twitter and deleted it from my phone and iPad. Had a fling with TikTok but that too felt like wasting time. Now my phone is boring. I spent a good amount of time clearing out RSS and podcatcher feeds were my mainstays towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Work and health&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I worked on some cool projects this year like a Covid response dashboard for the CDC of Africa, I got to collab with the fine folks at Happy Cog which felt like a childhood dream come true, and I even made progress on building a product with Paravel — but I’m exhausted. Professionally fulfilled, but exhausted. Can’t remember a single “slow” week. This sounds dour, but it’s sort of how it works out running and starting your own company. I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority. And to make a priority I think that needs to a part of my main priority (work) in some way. The plan is to trick my brain into thinking that fitness is part of my job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Some goals&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plucking some goals for next year…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make my personal health part of my job&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read 40 books, at least 10 paper books and 10 sci-fi books&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Figure out what truly relaxes me&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I’m doing goals again. Feel free to ask me about ‘em.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 21:47:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2021/12/twenty-twentyone/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2021/12/twenty-twentyone/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №12</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Phew. December. The most hectic month. End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But we made it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained. This happens every year, to the extent that my wife’s family used to think I was faking a sickness to avoid them, but no, I actually like them, it’s my body giving up when work stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Christmas this year was an interstate affair. After realizing flights cost $3200, we resolved to drive to Nebraska to celebrate with my family this year. It’s about ~1000 miles each way. The payoff is seeing my enormous divorced family, brother and step-brothers and their wives, aunts, uncles, cousins, their kids, and 11 of my 23 nieces and nephews. There’s something special about kids playing with their cousins, calling the same people grandma and grandpa has magical properties. Endless screaming, yelling, video games, and snowy mountains of Ready Whip sprayed atop mini-waffles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hauling Christmas across America isn’t my favorite thing, by air or by land. But driving across America is a neat rite of passage and it’s also the thing that will make me run for public office so we can get some bullet trains in this god forsaken country. Seeing family and celebrating the great magical fat norseman are special times, but I don’t feel super “restored” coming back from vacation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, I’m tired. I’m weak. I’m worn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🚙 &lt;strong&gt;Drove&lt;/strong&gt;: 1,890+ miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/30js2ji&quot;&gt;Disciplined Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt; - A quick and easy startup bootcamp with a 24 step process.

Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodos1n1-As&quot;&gt;The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?&lt;/a&gt;” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDb6VBO9os&quot;&gt;What Is Open Source &amp;amp; Why Do I Feel So Guilty?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UIDb6VBO9os&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day &lt;code&gt;npm install whatever-i-want&lt;/code&gt;; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-relies-on-people-working-for-free-a79104a68bcc&quot;&gt;The internet relies on people working for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Burnout”. There’s the word.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lab.github.com/&quot;&gt;There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;how to start&lt;/em&gt; a new open source project, or &lt;em&gt;how to add tooling&lt;/em&gt;, but almost no information or best practices on &lt;em&gt;how to maintain&lt;/em&gt; a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase &lt;code&gt;num_developers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;num_repos&lt;/code&gt;,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Differentiating between support requests and Issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Issue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to handle volume without losing your soul&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Landing pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Setting up testing and continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to get Sponsors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How and why to use Discussions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How and why to use Projects and Milestones&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to write good documentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Setting boundaries and office hours&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Effective and clear communication&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Choosing an open source business model&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s &lt;strong&gt;humans working for free&lt;/strong&gt; on the other side of that comment box. &lt;code&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt; is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t? My weary soul wants to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 01:21:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2021/12/sustaining-maintaining/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2021/12/sustaining-maintaining/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №11</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outage. The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro&lt;/a&gt; and we think you’ll love it. Before we open the doors, we need to let it bake a bit more with our first cohort of beta testing customers. Then we’ll have more to talk about and show.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Other vibes&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of mental energy learning and establishing my thoughts about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs this month. Some of that thinking leaked out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/490/&quot;&gt;Shop Talk Show #490&lt;/a&gt;. I think &lt;em&gt;I’m out&lt;/em&gt; for now. There’s a lot to say. Solving ledger-like problems seems okay. DAOs are (probably unenforcable, but) interesting. But truly, nothing compelling other than FOMO right now. Money charts going up is cool and produces a great amount of envy, but I read a lot, listened to a lot of podcasts, challenged myself to be open-minded and not old man yells at cloud, yet … I can’t. And that’s where I’m at on that, for now at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All the Web3 hype (as well as Politics Twitter) actually made me uninstall Twitter from my iPad and iPhone… and I kind of love it. I’m unplugged from the outrage machine and it’s much quieter. Stomping the urge to reinstall the app or log in from Mobile Safari for some dumb tweet is the hardest part, but I’m so far successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With time to kill, I spent a lot of time watching TikToks and roleplaying videos, both popular DnD5E series (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8pLvV3FjPc&quot;&gt;Critical Role&lt;/a&gt; (Campaign 3), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgB5-7hH_Ew&quot;&gt;Battle for Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuS1K-Sr3rA&quot;&gt;The Adventure Zone: Imbalance&lt;/a&gt;) and for one-shots systems like Lasers and Feelings. I’m enchanted by the idea of running a one-shot and may try to put one together in one of my Discords. But for now I’ll live vicariously through watching videos and pretend I’m pretending… wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m even starting to think about making a video game again…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Opted for podcasts over audiobooks this month, but still managed to squeeze in three books.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3CSnUVz&quot;&gt;The Bomber Mafia&lt;/a&gt; - Continuing my quest to read all the Malcom Gladwell novels. This book was a bit dull, but the theme around “Is there an ethical way to bomb during war?” and the exploration of that theme was interesting enough to sustain me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://podcast.clearleft.com/&quot;&gt;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&lt;/a&gt; - A business classic! An interesting look at how different personalities and attitudes can impact a team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3mBH1O0&quot;&gt;Effortless&lt;/a&gt; - Another good, thought-provoking book by Greg McKeown. “How do you not feel overwhelmed even when you become an essentialist?” McKeown shares some strategies for creating “effortless” work. Not 100% practical, but challenging at least.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📝 &lt;strong&gt;Blogging&lt;/strong&gt;: Did not ride the blogging train into November as I hoped, but it’s fine, I watched TikToks instead.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/11/gaming-improved-my-eq/&quot;&gt;Gaming improved my EQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/11/tf2-hats/&quot;&gt;Status Performance Analysis in Team Fortress 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;💪 &lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;: Mild setback as I may have injured a butt cheek swinging a pickaxe while clearing the nandina out of the side yard with my neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🎙 &lt;strong&gt;Podcasts and YouTubes&lt;/strong&gt;: Released a normal amount of podcasts.

It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI &amp;amp; Games YouTube channel breaks it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s &lt;strong&gt;social status&lt;/strong&gt; (social interactions) based on their &lt;strong&gt;status performance&lt;/strong&gt; (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting. Louis Vuitton, but Loot Boxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways… NFTs&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:54:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2021/11/tf2-hats/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2021/11/tf2-hats/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>NFTs are sucking the air out of everything</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/rss-club/&quot;&gt;Read more about RSS Club&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twitter has been fever-pitched about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs. It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 01:38:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2021/11/nfts-are-sucking-the-air-out-of-everything/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2021/11/nfts-are-sucking-the-air-out-of-everything/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Gaming improved my EQ</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gamers aren’t known for being the most intelligent people around…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Oh no Tim... 🌎&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timthetatman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@timthetatman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/njLv2c59Jy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/njLv2c59Jy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Wipz (@Wipz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wipz/status/1288489280600526849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While IQ may be at an all time low, I think there’s actually a wealth of emotional intelligence (EQ) within competitive gaming. It’s &lt;em&gt;un-gamer&lt;/em&gt; to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nerf&lt;/strong&gt; - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buff&lt;/strong&gt; - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;salty&lt;/strong&gt; - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;toxic&lt;/strong&gt; - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tilted&lt;/strong&gt; - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;meta&lt;/strong&gt; - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;meta shift&lt;/strong&gt; - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mental&lt;/strong&gt; - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chalked&lt;/strong&gt; - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blender&lt;/strong&gt; - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;game sense&lt;/strong&gt; - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;psychic damage&lt;/strong&gt; - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&amp;amp;D)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be &lt;strong&gt;tilted&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Taking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m &lt;strong&gt;tilted&lt;/strong&gt; —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; I need to reset, I know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, &lt;strong&gt;salty&lt;/strong&gt;, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a &lt;strong&gt;blender&lt;/strong&gt; helps let the &lt;strong&gt;psychic damage&lt;/strong&gt; roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;strong&gt;meta shifts&lt;/strong&gt; is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all &lt;strong&gt;game sense&lt;/strong&gt; and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to &lt;strong&gt;meta shifts in technology&lt;/strong&gt; has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should &lt;em&gt;deal&lt;/em&gt; damage, a tank player should &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; damage, and a support player should &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; damage. There’s not one uniform metric for success, if you measure solely on damage dealt that skews the reality of how success happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bringing this full circle, even your worst performing player — who it would be easy to throw under the bus — might be adding immeasurable value…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A message to the worst one on the team... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pJIuaTE5Mc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/pJIuaTE5Mc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1349421209683898371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adding value as “the anchor”.

Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Goodbye Grandma Jeanne&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The case of the ill-fitting jacket&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Autumnal Camping&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Starting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Business-wise&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Stats-based Vibe Gamification&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3Bzg7ee&quot;&gt;I Alone Can Fix It&lt;/a&gt; - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3DxdVF6&quot;&gt;The Manager’s Path&lt;/a&gt; - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3Bxt5IR&quot;&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; - Andy Weir knows how to write action.
