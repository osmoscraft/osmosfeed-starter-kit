      "title": "Vibe Check №13",
      "summary": "Buckle up. This month turned out to be a big one. Writing it all out feels like an entire year went by, so I’ll start with the bad that happened at the beginning of the month and move towards the good.\nGot COVID\nWhen I posted my Vibe Check №12 and End of 2021 posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.\nThankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tell.\nI don’t plan on getting COVID again, but if there’s a silver lining, it’s that at least the general fear of getting it has gone away. But that’s a me-centric perspective when 887,780+ people have passed away from this thing.\nRest in peace, Jackson\nOn January 4th a friend of our family unexpectedly passed away. Jackson taught me a lot over the years and had a helluva life story. During the civil war in his home country of Liberia, he and some other boys were taken out and left in the desert to die. He survived and came to the US as a young boy in a shipping container. He married (later divorced) and had four wonderful kids. Despite the challenges in his life, he always had an impossible sense of hope which could brighten your day.\nThrough Jackson I saw first hand how difficult the US immigration system is when a single stain on your record makes you a target for deportation. No pathways, delayed work permits, years of unemployment, immigration lawyers fees, health issues, doctors bills; I saw how unfair the system was to him and his family.\nBut he loved his kids. Every ounce of concern and every penny he made went to providing for his kids. His kids are nearly grown up now, the first is going off to college on scholarship, and I know they’re going to miss him but I know they know how much he loved them. It’s a sad situation to lose a dedicated parent in high school. If you can spare a prayer for Jackson’s kids and our neighbor Cleo (who was like a mother to Jackson), thank you.\n2022 Mantras\nIt’s been a rough start to the year for sure, but we’re getting through it. I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.\n\n2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent) - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.\n2022: Be less disgusting - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.\n\nAnd for grown-ups, I got another one.\n\n2022: Buy your happiness - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.\n\nI hate how consumerist that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!\nEpisode 500 of ShopTalk\nI wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.\nAnd celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.\nI built my first Gunpla\n\nOn a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.\nMaking my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.\nI have a new ergonomic keyboard to build, a book of Frank Lloyd Wright kirigami papercraft models, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.\nAnother big refactor on Luro\nOne of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on Luro. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a tech de jour it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.\ntl;dr— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with boring technology, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.\nStatistics\nBecause I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.\n\n💪 Fitness - Closed my rings 5 days this month\n\nBack doing Apple Fitness\nBack doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off\n\n\n📖 Reading\n\nPeril - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books? You base content heirarchy on what’s before and what’s after?\nViolence. Speed. Momentum. - The Dr. Disrespect origin story. 100% toxic action figure masculinity and 100% YAYAYAYAYAYA.\nApocalyptiGirl - I enjoyed this simple post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi.\nHead Lopper Vol 4 - Possibly my least favorite Head Lopper, but still Head Lopper so it’s weird and good.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime - Got COVID, so I had time to watch some shows.\n\nFoundation (AppleTV) - A sci-fi story based on the books by Isaac Asimov. The story lines are a bit drummed up but it makes for better TV.\nKomi Can’t Communicate (Netflix) - A shonen story about a boy helping a classmate who has a fear of talking. The supporting cast helps carry the show.\nNew Game (Crunchyroll) - A show about new situation anxiety centered around a recent high school graduate joining a game studio.\nGundam I (Netflix) - 13 TV episodes smashed into one long movie with fight scenes every 12 minutes.\n\n\n👾 Video games - Playing some\n\nReturn of the Obra Dinn - A murder mystery on a pirate ship\nTwelve Minutes - A murder mystery in your own apartment\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts - One big celebration and one podcast series you should check out.\n\nRecorded\n\n500th Episode of ShopTalk - 🎉\nAn HTML Select element that is… actually styleable - Chris and I look at the new <selectmenu> prototype built by some folks in Open UI.\n\n\nListened\n\nScene on Radio S4: The Land That Never Has Been Yet - I had to pick my jaw up off the floor as I learned, for the first time, about some of the racist and oligarchic systems embedded in the founding of America that still impact our country today.\n\n\n\n\n📝 Blogging - Some observational posts and a “shitty sci-fi” post which I plan on doing more of.\n\nHTML is general, ARIA is specific - Observational tech blogging.

Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.\nMaking my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.\nI have a new ergonomic keyboard to build, a book of Frank Lloyd Wright kirigami papercraft models, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.\nAnother big refactor on Luro\nOne of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on Luro. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a tech de jour it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.\ntl;dr— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with boring technology, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.\nStatistics\nBecause I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.\n\n💪 Fitness - Closed my rings 5 days this month\n\nBack doing Apple Fitness\nBack doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off\n\n\n📖 Reading\n\nPeril - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books? You base content heirarchy on what’s before and what’s after?\nViolence. Speed. Momentum. - The Dr. Disrespect origin story. 100% toxic action figure masculinity and 100% YAYAYAYAYAYA.\nApocalyptiGirl - I enjoyed this simple post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi.\nHead Lopper Vol 4 - Possibly my least favorite Head Lopper, but still Head Lopper so it’s weird and good.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime - Got COVID, so I had time to watch some shows.\n\nFoundation (AppleTV) - A sci-fi story based on the books by Isaac Asimov. The story lines are a bit drummed up but it makes for better TV.\nKomi Can’t Communicate (Netflix) - A shonen story about a boy helping a classmate who has a fear of talking. The supporting cast helps carry the show.\nNew Game (Crunchyroll) - A show about new situation anxiety centered around a recent high school graduate joining a game studio.\nGundam I (Netflix) - 13 TV episodes smashed into one long movie with fight scenes every 12 minutes.\n\n\n👾 Video games - Playing some\n\nReturn of the Obra Dinn - A murder mystery on a pirate ship\nTwelve Minutes - A murder mystery in your own apartment\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts - One big celebration and one podcast series you should check out.\n\nRecorded\n\n500th Episode of ShopTalk - 🎉\nAn HTML Select element that is… actually styleable - Chris and I look at the new <selectmenu> prototype built by some folks in Open UI.\n\n\nListened\n\nScene on Radio S4: The Land That Never Has Been Yet - I had to pick my jaw up off the floor as I learned, for the first time, about some of the racist and oligarchic systems embedded in the founding of America that still impact our country today.\n\n\n\n\n📝 Blogging - Some observational posts and a “shitty sci-fi” post which I plan on doing more of.\n\nHTML is general, ARIA is specific - Observational tech blogging. Mixed feedback on this, not sure if I explained it the best, so I’ll keep exploring.\nThe man playing the ukulele at the doctor’s office. - Observational blogging\nThe Vacation - A short sci-fi story based on my lament that everything costs money these days.\nFive Hundred ShopTalks - A celebration of 10 years of podcasting\n\n\n🤖 Crafts\n\nBandai Entry Grade Mobile Suit Gundam RX-78-2\n\n\n",

      "summary": "Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.\nIt’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handful of series that capture snapshots of the industry which I find offer up a neat vantage point of “what’s happening now” from tons of different voices. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to gain perspectives outside my own.\nI’m lucky enough to have worked on some cool projects (I once made the Microsoft.com homepage in my spare bedroom), but ShopTalk stands out as a distinct career highlight due to its consistency over time. On a hard drive somewhere I have a graveyard of abandoned side projects, apps, podcasts, and games… yet ShopTalk still stands. We log in every week and do it. Hopefully, getting a smidge better every time. Not all projects need to go 10+ years — and that’s something I still need to learn, it’s okay for them to go away, they can and should change — but it’s rewarding when you’re still having fun doing the thing you started doing so long ago. Fine wine, yadda yadda.\nLessons learned\nThe biggest lesson I’ve learned about podcasting over the last 10 years: it’s all about consistency and quality. Releasing on a consistent day/week/etc (whatever that is for your show) and making sure the show you send to people’s earbuds and cars is a good quality audio file; that means good mic, good edit, decent music and audio cues.\nFor your podcast or (in more contemporary parlance) your livestream focus on finding one easy thing that can boost your quality. I’m a firm believer in the 80:20 rule, there’s often a trick you can do that makes your thing 80% better with 20% of the effort. Often that’s a microphone or learning proper mic technique. Figure it out for your situation, it’s worth it.\nThe other thing Chris and I talk about often is that whenever we’ve needed to make a decision we’ve always sided on making our lives easier and we have no regrets. This allows us to continue to enjoy the podcasting with less stress. For example, I use a USB mic with no audio interface, because easier. We don’t do high concept shows that often, because easier. We don’t typically have more than two guests, because easier. We pay an audio editor, because easier. “Easier” has been a good compass for us.\nLooking forward\nIt’s tough to predict the future of ShopTalk, but it’s more of the same I think. We flamed out a bit on getting guests lined up during the pandemic but I think there’s energy to get back on track. We’ve invested in our “studio” a bit and are using Riverside.fm to make having guests and capturing quality audio even easier.\nThe biggest change going forward is that we’ve branched out into video over on the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel. Be sure to smash that like button and subscribe. We’ve made ~24 episodes since September which isn’t too shabby for a buncha dads.\nThe final thing is the ShopTalk D-D-D-Discord. We’ve pivoted a smidge from being a broadcast-only podcast to being more of an active community. Lots of friendly folks in there now and because it’s a global chatroom so there’s messages and activity happening from when I wake up to when I go to bed. That’s exciting. There’s a lot more we could be doing (weekly hangouts or whatever) and hope to explore that more going forward.\nAnd lastly,\nThanks to all the people we’ve brought on board to help with the show. First was Aaron Dowd editing, then Chris Enns took over at the audio editor helm, the folks at BuySellAds helping sell ads, Tina Pham at Pham Transcription Services, Miranda Mulligan for helping us with the books, Chris Taylor for the theme songs, the D-D-D-Discord for inspiration, WordPress devs and plugin authors who have helped work on the site, and countless guests who have let us pick their brains over the years. Thanks to everyone who has helped out.\nThank you, dear listener, for downloading ShopTalk in your podcatcher of choice. It means a lot to me that you’d take the time to listen, even once. Thank you.

      "summary": "It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nTwitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.\nI mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click > Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.\nOk. Whatever. Then Twitter’s implementation took it a step further and when you add your NFT as a pfp (which you could do before), it added a hexagonal clipping mask to NFT profile pictures. Users that have NFTs get a hexagon, users that don’t get regular old circles. That distinction, that ability to broadcast status, is now coded into the entire application.\nIt’s weird. NFT pfps already had a strong sense of in-group membership and status performance. You could already spot a crypto enthusiast by their gaudy, semi-generative, ape-themed or pixelated punk profile pic. Thousands of minted NFTs already had a consistent square format (for use as profile pictures) but Twitter added hexagons to the mix for… pizazz? As a watermark to assert ownership?\nThe crypto community is not short on memes and social signifiers: apes, whales, pixel punks, diamond hands, to the moon, laser eyes, “gm”, WAGMI, probably nothing, .eth usernames, and a slew of in-group words no one else uses like “airdrop”, “fiat”, “petrodollar”, etc. Plenty of indicators, why add another?\nI shouldn’t get worked up about a shape, but what I specifically don’t like about the hexagons are that they create another form of “otherism”; haves and have-nots. HODLers and NGMIs. Two camps. In-group and out-group. It’s creating division in a place where the world didn’t need any help creating division. The world doesn’t need more us versus them, yet we willingly apply feature glitter to increse the divide.\nSomewhat apropos to this whole situation we’ve found ourselves in, the hexagon is just a thin veneer of symbolism; a mask applied to the mundane giving it the appearance of something special. An illusion of value.\nTransmitted via web2 for obvious reasons.",

I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.\nI’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority. And to make a priority I think that needs to a part of my main priority (work) in some way. The plan is to trick my brain into thinking that fitness is part of my job.\nSome goals\nPlucking some goals for next year…\n\nMake my personal health part of my job\nRead 40 books, at least 10 paper books and 10 sci-fi books\nFigure out what truly relaxes me\n\nYeah. I’m doing goals again. Feel free to ask me about ‘em.",

      "summary": "You see it all the time; a repo with a thousand issues, a hundred open PRs, a thousand forks. v2.0 is on the way but there’s no clear roadmap or communication. Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.\nThe critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.\nFor every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.\nIt would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.\nBut financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source & Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”\n\nFrom the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.\nTowards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:\n\nWith the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.\n\n“Burnout”. There’s the word.\nI sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.\nIf I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:\n\nDifferentiating between support requests and Issues\nIssue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)\nHow to handle volume without losing your soul\nLanding pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)\nSetting up testing and continuous integration\nHow to get Sponsors\nHow and why to use Discussions\nHow and why to use Projects and Milestones\nHow to write good documentation\nSetting boundaries and office hours\nEffective and clear communication\nChoosing an open source business model\n\nOr what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.\nI think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.\nThere’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.\nThese are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t?

There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.\nBut financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source & Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”\n\nFrom the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.\nTowards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:\n\nWith the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.\n\n“Burnout”. There’s the word.\nI sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.\nIf I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:\n\nDifferentiating between support requests and Issues\nIssue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)\nHow to handle volume without losing your soul\nLanding pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)\nSetting up testing and continuous integration\nHow to get Sponsors\nHow and why to use Discussions\nHow and why to use Projects and Milestones\nHow to write good documentation\nSetting boundaries and office hours\nEffective and clear communication\nChoosing an open source business model\n\nOr what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.\nI think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.\nThere’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.\nThese are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t? My weary soul wants to know.",

The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well.

The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an undefined function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.\nSpeaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret.

I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.\nNFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.\nTwo weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.",

It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:\n\nnerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality\nbuff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality\nsalty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.\ntoxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.\ntilted - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.\nmeta - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.\nmeta shift - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.\nmental - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.\nchalked - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.\nblender - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”\ngame sense - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions\npsychic damage - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&D)\n\nThrough gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be tilted. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.\nTaking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, salty, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a blender helps let the psychic damage roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.\nThe concept of meta shifts is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.\nCooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage.

      "summary": "Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.\nI needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.\nI hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.\nGoodbye Grandma Jeanne\nMy wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.\nShe was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.\nI never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.\nThe case of the ill-fitting jacket\nWhile trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.\nThat… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.\nThus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.\nAutumnal Camping\nIn the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.\nWe are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.\nStarting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂\nBusiness-wise\nBusiness-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.\nStats-based Vibe Gamification\n\n📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.\nThe Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.\nArtemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.\nMonumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction. This is a story I hadn’t heard and needs to be retold more often. The problems then mirror our problems today. If it were not for Dunn’s untimely death, America might be a different place.\n\n\n📝 Blogging: Blogtober was a success.\n\nWhy don’t video games take sex seriously?\nMy Retirement Seminar\nHTML with Superpowers 20K hits!\n🎨 Alpha Paintlet\nLet’s talk about Native HTML Tabs\nThe mistake every new game developer makes\nMy pre-publish blogging rituals\nHolding Beef 🥩\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Obvs not doing enough here. Pickleball is great tho.\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes: Another good month for content. 8 videos for ShopTalk Video, 4 audio episodes of ShopTalk, and 2 episodes of Aside Quest, and 1 guest appearance.\n\nShopTalk Videos\n\nBreakin’ Up CSS Custom Properties\nUse Alpha Transparency on Any Color in CSS with a (tiny) Paint Worklet\nA Quick Cloudflare Worker with Storage\nSubgrid is All About Inheriting Grid Lines\nDetails Elements Obviously Need a Pizza Arrow\nSpicy Sections\nPlaying with the MD Nichrome Microsite\n\n\nGuest Appearances\n\nI appeared on Enjoy the Vue #77 talking about Petite-Vue\n\n\nI also listened to some good podcasts.\n\nThe Adventure Zone - Ethersea - Dungeons & Dragons in a post-apocalyptic aquatic underworld.

      "content_text": "Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.\nI needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.\nI hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.\nGoodbye Grandma Jeanne\nMy wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.\nShe was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.\nI never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.\nThe case of the ill-fitting jacket\nWhile trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.\nThat… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.\nThus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.\nAutumnal Camping\nIn the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.\nWe are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.\nStarting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂\nBusiness-wise\nBusiness-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.\nStats-based Vibe Gamification\n\n📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.\nThe Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.\nArtemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.\nMonumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction. This is a story I hadn’t heard and needs to be retold more often. The problems then mirror our problems today. If it were not for Dunn’s untimely death, America might be a different place.\n\n\n📝 Blogging: Blogtober was a success.\n\nWhy don’t video games take sex seriously?\nMy Retirement Seminar\nHTML with Superpowers 20K hits!\n🎨 Alpha Paintlet\nLet’s talk about Native HTML Tabs\nThe mistake every new game developer makes\nMy pre-publish blogging rituals\nHolding Beef 🥩\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Obvs not doing enough here.

This month turned out to be a big one. Writing it all out feels like an entire year went by, so I’ll start with the bad that happened at the beginning of the month and move towards the good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Got COVID&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I posted my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/12/vibe-check-12/&quot;&gt;Vibe Check №12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/12/twenty-twentyone/&quot;&gt;End of 2021&lt;/a&gt; posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan on getting COVID again, but if there’s a silver lining, it’s that at least the general fear of getting it has gone away. But that’s a me-centric perspective when 887,780+ people have passed away from this thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Rest in peace, Jackson&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On January 4th a friend of our family unexpectedly passed away. Jackson taught me a lot over the years and had a helluva life story. During the civil war in his home country of Liberia, he and some other boys were taken out and left in the desert to die. He survived and came to the US as a young boy in a shipping container. He married (later divorced) and had four wonderful kids. Despite the challenges in his life, he always had an impossible sense of hope which could brighten your day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through Jackson I saw first hand how difficult the US immigration system is when a single stain on your record makes you a target for deportation. No pathways, delayed work permits, years of unemployment, immigration lawyers fees, health issues, doctors bills; I saw how unfair the system was to him and his family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But he loved his kids. Every ounce of concern and every penny he made went to providing for his kids. His kids are nearly grown up now, the first is going off to college on scholarship, and I know they’re going to miss him but I know they know how much he loved them. It’s a sad situation to lose a dedicated parent in high school. If you can spare a prayer for Jackson’s kids and our neighbor Cleo (who was like a mother to Jackson), thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2022 Mantras&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been a rough start to the year for sure, but we’re getting through it. I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent)&lt;/strong&gt; - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022: Be less disgusting&lt;/strong&gt; - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And for grown-ups, I got another one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022: Buy your happiness&lt;/strong&gt; - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hate how &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/&quot;&gt;consumerist&lt;/a&gt; that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Episode 500 of ShopTalk&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/01/five-hundred-shoptalks/&quot;&gt;I wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode&lt;/a&gt; so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I built my first Gunpla&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/gunpla.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A small plastic model Gundam robot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Making my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://kbdfans.com/products/ic-kbdfans-mountain-ergo-keyboard-kit?variant=39809723039883&quot;&gt;a new ergonomic keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to build, a book of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3s4c1Yi&quot;&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright &lt;em&gt;kirigami&lt;/em&gt; papercraft models&lt;/a&gt;, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Another big refactor on Luro&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro&lt;/a&gt;. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a &lt;em&gt;tech de jour&lt;/em&gt; it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with &lt;a href=&quot;http://boringtechnology.club/&quot;&gt;boring technology&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;💪 &lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; - Closed my rings 5 days this month\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Back doing Apple Fitness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Back doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3rHpQvE&quot;&gt;Peril&lt;/a&gt; - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books?

That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/186-dave-goes-windows/&quot;&gt;I switched operating systems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/443/&quot;&gt;switched back&lt;/a&gt;. We delved into a handful of &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/series/&quot;&gt;series that capture snapshots of the industry&lt;/a&gt; which I find offer up a neat vantage point of “what’s happening now” from tons of different voices. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to gain perspectives outside my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky enough to have worked on some cool projects (I once made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://Microsoft.com&quot;&gt;Microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt; homepage in my spare bedroom), but ShopTalk stands out as a distinct career highlight due to its consistency over time. On a hard drive somewhere I have a graveyard of abandoned side projects, apps, podcasts, and games… yet ShopTalk still stands. We log in every week and do it. Hopefully, getting a smidge better every time. Not all projects need to go 10+ years — and that’s something I still need to learn, it’s okay for them to go away, they can and should change — but it’s rewarding when you’re still having fun doing the thing you started doing so long ago. Fine wine, yadda yadda.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson I’ve learned about podcasting over the last 10 years: it’s all about &lt;strong&gt;consistency&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;quality&lt;/strong&gt;. Releasing on a consistent day/week/etc (whatever that is for your show) and making sure the show you send to people’s earbuds and cars is a good quality audio file; that means good mic, good edit, decent music and audio cues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For your podcast or (in more contemporary parlance) your livestream focus on finding one easy thing that can boost your quality. I’m a firm believer in the 80:20 rule, there’s often a trick you can do that makes your thing 80% better with 20% of the effort. Often that’s a microphone or learning proper mic technique. Figure it out for your situation, it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing Chris and I talk about often is that whenever we’ve needed to make a decision we’ve always sided on making our lives easier and we have no regrets. This allows us to continue to enjoy the podcasting with less stress. For example, I use a USB mic with no audio interface, because easier. We don’t do high concept shows that often, because easier. We don’t typically have more than two guests, because easier. We pay an audio editor, because easier. “Easier” has been a good compass for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s tough to predict the future of ShopTalk, but it’s more of the same I think. We flamed out a bit on getting guests lined up during the pandemic but I think there’s energy to get back on track. We’ve invested in our “studio” a bit and are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://Riverside.fm&quot;&gt;Riverside.fm&lt;/a&gt; to make having guests and capturing quality audio even easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest change going forward is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/video/&quot;&gt;we’ve branched out into video&lt;/a&gt; over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/realcsstricks&quot;&gt;CSS-Tricks YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to smash that like button and subscribe. We’ve made ~24 episodes since September which isn’t too shabby for a buncha dads.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The final thing is the ShopTalk D-D-D-Discord. We’ve pivoted a smidge from being a broadcast-only podcast to being more of an active community. Lots of friendly folks in there now and because it’s a global chatroom so there’s messages and activity happening from when I wake up to when I go to bed. That’s exciting. There’s a lot more we could be doing (weekly hangouts or whatever) and hope to explore that more going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;And lastly,&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the people we’ve brought on board to help with the show. First was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aarondowd.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Dowd&lt;/a&gt; editing, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonproductions.ca/&quot;&gt;Chris Enns&lt;/a&gt; took over at the audio editor helm, the folks at BuySellAds helping sell ads, Tina Pham at &lt;a href=&quot;https://phamtranscriptionservices.com/&quot;&gt;Pham Transcription Services&lt;/a&gt;, Miranda Mulligan for helping us with the books, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Chris Taylor&lt;/a&gt; for the theme songs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/shoptalkshow&quot;&gt;the D-D-D-Discord&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration, WordPress devs and plugin authors who have helped work on the site, and countless guests who have let us pick their brains over the years. Thanks to everyone who has helped out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you, dear listener, for downloading ShopTalk in your podcatcher of choice. It means a lot to me that you’d take the time to listen, even once. Thank you. Shopomaniacs 4 lyfe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, thanks to Chris Coyier, my partner in podcast crimes. It’s been a blast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Just. Build. Websites.”&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 21:31:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/01/five-hundred-shoptalks/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/01/five-hundred-shoptalks/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>The Vacation</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;I situated myself in the premium white leather chair, lowered the rollercoaster-like safety harness over my torso, and carefully weighed options on the console in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Evening . . . . . . . . 20/person\n&amp;gt; Overnight . . . . . . . 100/person\n&amp;gt; Weekend . . . . . . . . 250/person\n&amp;gt; Week (BEST VALUE!)  . . 5000/family (Limit: 5)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over my right shoulder to see my wife and kids’ anxious faces gleaming back at me, ready with the nervous energy of a thousand suns to embark on our well-earned vacation. It’s been awhile. Some rough, lean years working like hell but through sacrifices and extreme budgeting we had finally saved up enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated to tap the screen. A nervous laugh. A moment of internal calculus. Maybe a handful of evenings would be enough. Would it have the same effect? A couple weekends would surely be enough to reset. More economical. And then we’d have a little left over, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I sensed my wife’s mind-reading. I sensed her fear I would succumb to my inner self-doubt. She has been working the hardest for this. Sacrificing to create these memories. I needed to shake those miser habits we’ve formed out of years of austerity, what has become my identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, alright. Here we go,” I groaned and grimaced as I tapped the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“You selected &lt;code&gt;One Week&lt;/code&gt;” chimed the female voice of the console. Our chairs tilted slightly back, I felt the credits debit from my account, we were off. Finally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hiss of the pneumatic syringes, the sting on the spinal column, the cool and heavy breeze of the sedatives, the warm cocktail of endorphins and dopamine to stimulate our deepest dreams and desires, the chairs and harnesses catching our weight as we drifted away from consciousness. The lights in the room slowly dimmed. We would be back in a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/01/the-vacation/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/01/the-vacation/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>The Hexagons and the Hexa-nots</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/rss-club/&quot;&gt;Read more about RSS Club&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click &amp;gt; Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. Whatever. Then Twitter’s implementation took it a step further and when you add your NFT as a pfp (which you could do before), it added a hexagonal clipping mask to NFT profile pictures. Users that have NFTs get a hexagon, users that don’t get regular old circles. That distinction, that ability to broadcast status, is now coded into the entire application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s weird. NFT pfps already had a strong sense of in-group membership and &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/11/tf2-hats/&quot;&gt;status performance&lt;/a&gt;. You could already spot a crypto enthusiast by their gaudy, semi-generative, ape-themed or pixelated punk profile pic. Thousands of minted NFTs already had a consistent square format (for use as profile pictures) but Twitter added hexagons to the mix for… pizazz? As a watermark to assert ownership?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The crypto community is not short on memes and social signifiers: apes, whales, pixel punks, diamond hands, to the moon, laser eyes, “gm”, WAGMI, probably nothing, &lt;code&gt;.eth&lt;/code&gt; usernames, and a slew of in-group words no one else uses like “airdrop”, “fiat”, “petrodollar”, etc. Plenty of indicators, why add another?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldn’t get worked up about a shape, but what I specifically don’t like about the hexagons are that they create another form of “otherism”; haves and have-nots. HODLers and NGMIs. Two camps. In-group and out-group. It’s creating division in a place where the world didn’t need any help creating division. The world doesn’t need more &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, yet we willingly apply feature glitter to increse the divide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhat apropos to this whole situation we’ve found ourselves in, the hexagon is just a thin veneer of symbolism; a mask applied to the mundane giving it the appearance of something special. An illusion of value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Transmitted via web2 for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/01/hexagons/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/01/hexagons/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>The man playing the ukulele at the doctor’s office.</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was leaving a doctor’s appointment and as I rounded the corner to the waiting room I could hear the dulcet tones of a ukulele, but it sounded close.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was “What in the fuck is going on?” as I scanned the ceiling for the speaker where the Muzak was coming from. Then in the waiting room I saw an older white man with a ponytail and a Hawaiian shirt calmly strumming his ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I reacted, “What the fuck is going on?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then I caught myself. This… is… weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why was he playing it in the doctors office? Was he a minstrel? Was he calming the souls of fellow patients?  A minister? A minister to himself? Does he just love Hawaii and goddamn it ain’t no one gonna stop him not even the cops at the doctors office?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think this moment struck me like a ton of bricks because it’s been awhile since I’ve encountered weird due to the pandemic. Angry? Oh, I’ve encountered plenty of angry. Hot-headed assholes losing their shit in a Chic-fil-A drive thru, yeah I’ve seen that, but been awhile since I’ve seen weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The world could use a little more weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I miss weird. I miss old Austin.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:51:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/01/the-man-playing-the-ukulele-at-the-doctor-s-office/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/01/the-man-playing-the-ukulele-at-the-doctor-s-office/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>HTML is general, ARIA is specific</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-ui.org/&quot;&gt;Open UI&lt;/a&gt; there’s been some discussion about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/417&quot;&gt;what default ARIA role the proposed &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;popupdialog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element should have&lt;/a&gt;, if any…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The proposed &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;popupdialog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a &lt;em&gt;non-modal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt;, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a &lt;code&gt;listbox&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tooltip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;combobox&lt;/code&gt;, etc. which are not a &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt; and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt;? Or should it be nothing like a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is &lt;code&gt;display: popup&lt;/code&gt; the best primitive here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Sure, that can be a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:09:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/01/html-is-general-aria-is-specific/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/01/html-is-general-aria-is-specific/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Twenty Twentyone</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you quantify a whole year? I’ve attempted it before and this one is different because I didn’t set out to achieve anything. The mantra for the year was “&lt;strong&gt;No goals, only vibes”&lt;/strong&gt; and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁 Started the year in Stage 5 Covid&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Paid off our car!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁🙁🙁 Witnessed an insurrection&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost my grandma Joyce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Started a ShopTalk Discord&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Got a new backyard office shed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🥶🥶🥶 Lost power for 75 hours during the Texas Freeze&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Spoke on Accessibility Backlogs at axe-con&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost my aunt Renee&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Got vaccinated&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Spoke on Web Components at An Event Apart&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my camper fixed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Turned 41&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😐 Went river camping, but camper broke&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Beach camped on a Texas beach&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Rupert family reunion with white water rafting and hiking in Colorado&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁 Spent a bunch of money getting my car fixed (the one I paid off)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Worked with Open UI on Spicy Sections (aka, tabs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃 Started playing pickle ball&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Kids went back to school&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Building a product called Luro with my compadres at Paravel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Started making ShopTalk YouTubes with Chris&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 More camping with friends&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃 Blogtober’d&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost great grandma Jeanne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁🙁🙁 Got skin cancer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🙁🙁🙁 Got Mohs surgery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😐 Healed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😢 Lost great grandpa Ed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😵‍💫😵‍💫 Drove across America (twice)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😃😃😃 Saw my family for the holidays&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;😐 Ending the year in Stage 4 Covid&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;… and those are more or less the emotional beats in my story of last year. It’s been a year. Ups and downs. A big change for me and for this blog was that I documented it all in my monthly Vibe Checks. That was successful and enjoyable so I plan on continuing those. They’re great to look back on and for rounding up miscellaneous thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Getting diagnosed with skin cancer and having it removed with Mohs surgery was a big emotional part of the year. I describe it as “ambient stress”, a whiny noise in the background that you try not to pay attention but is affecting your mood. I’m a post-processor so I’m sure it’ll be a bit before that all sinks in. But the general health of my personhood is at the forefront of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Books and social media&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up 40 books this year, down from ~80 last year. A lot of the books and facts in similar genres started repeating themselves. I may have exhausted some of the self-help and popular science genres, it’s all rehashed Malcom Gladwell at some point. Losing steam, I paused on audiobooks and plowed thru podcast arcs instead. Those are fun and immersive. I think next year I’m going to try more paper books and sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Media-wise, I broke up with Twitter and deleted it from my phone and iPad. Had a fling with TikTok but that too felt like wasting time. Now my phone is boring. I spent a good amount of time clearing out RSS and podcatcher feeds were my mainstays towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Work and health&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I worked on some cool projects this year like a Covid response dashboard for the CDC of Africa, I got to collab with the fine folks at Happy Cog which felt like a childhood dream come true, and I even made progress on building a product with Paravel — but I’m exhausted. Professionally fulfilled, but exhausted. Can’t remember a single “slow” week. This sounds dour, but it’s sort of how it works out running and starting your own company. I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority. And to make a priority I think that needs to a part of my main priority (work) in some way. The plan is to trick my brain into thinking that fitness is part of my job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Some goals&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plucking some goals for next year…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make my personal health part of my job&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read 40 books, at least 10 paper books and 10 sci-fi books&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Figure out what truly relaxes me&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I’m doing goals again. Feel free to ask me about ‘em.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 21:47:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2021/12/twenty-twentyone/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2021/12/twenty-twentyone/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №12</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Phew. December. The most hectic month. End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But we made it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained. This happens every year, to the extent that my wife’s family used to think I was faking a sickness to avoid them, but no, I actually like them, it’s my body giving up when work stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Christmas this year was an interstate affair. After realizing flights cost $3200, we resolved to drive to Nebraska to celebrate with my family this year. It’s about ~1000 miles each way. The payoff is seeing my enormous divorced family, brother and step-brothers and their wives, aunts, uncles, cousins, their kids, and 11 of my 23 nieces and nephews. There’s something special about kids playing with their cousins, calling the same people grandma and grandpa has magical properties. Endless screaming, yelling, video games, and snowy mountains of Ready Whip sprayed atop mini-waffles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hauling Christmas across America isn’t my favorite thing, by air or by land. But driving across America is a neat rite of passage and it’s also the thing that will make me run for public office so we can get some bullet trains in this god forsaken country. Seeing family and celebrating the great magical fat norseman are special times, but I don’t feel super “restored” coming back from vacation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, I’m tired. I’m weak. I’m worn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🚙 &lt;strong&gt;Drove&lt;/strong&gt;: 1,890+ miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/30js2ji&quot;&gt;Disciplined Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt; - A quick and easy startup bootcamp with a 24 step process.
