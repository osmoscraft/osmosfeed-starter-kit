      "summary": "May is over already which means the kids are now out of school, summer has begun, and work is ramping up at Luro. Here is the retelling of vibes…\n\nThe little league championship 🏆\nIn my last vibe check I mentioned my son’s little league experience and how he and his teammates talked about the playoffs, but I wasn’t sure if they existed or not. Well… the playoffs were real! A single elimination playoff bracket. Eight teams enter, one team leaves…\nOtis’s team, the Athletics, squeaked their way through to the finals and ended up winning the Northwest Little League championship. 🎉\nA happy, unexpected end to our first full season of baseball. Seeing the growth of every kid on every team over the course of a season was a treat. At the beginning of the season no one can pitch and it’s a walk-a-thon, but then the pitchers start throwing strikes, then the kids realize they can’t stand there and need to start hitting, then the kids realize they need to start fielding the ball, then they start making plays and forcing outs. It’s a how-to play baseball montage that happens over eight weeks. The coaches did a phenomenal job and fostered a great experience.\nThe road to productivity hell is paved with context switching\nIn mid-April my wife got a job at the kids’ elementary school. It’s awesome and I think the job suits her unique skills; namely she can remember everyone’s name. One side effect of this lifestyle change is we destroyed the balance of household duties we’ve established over the last ~8 years since having kids.\nWe expected the change but a lot of May was about adjusting to this new balance. A day went like this: Wake up make breakfasts and lunch → Get the kids off to school → Work for an hour or two → Interrupt my morning flow with a meeting → Work a bit and get lunch → Sit down at my desk for an hour → Get the kids from school → Get the kids to swim → The kids ask me for snacks until their mom gets home → Try to get another hour of work done…\nDarn near impossible to establish any sort of deep work rhythm with that schedule. As a result I’m not sure I was as productive as I hoped to be last month.\nThe family context switching was extra, but even work had a considerable bit of context switching. A lot of switching back and forth between backend work → frontend work but also switching from building the product → building the business → building the engineering team. In a day I might cycle between product dev work → documentation → testing → meetings → podcasts → research → learning → side projects → open source. Each of those contexts have a Brain RAM cost. Mix in my (undiagnosed) ADHD and what a wonderful tapestry of distraction and experiences.\nFor some reason I thought this would be a good month to try live streaming some side project work on Twitch. After three streams I think my streaming career is kaput. In a different multiverse where I have no kids, I’m not starting a company, or if my work duties radically change… it could potentially work.\nThe tl;dr here is I need to eliminate some extra contexts from my life. That hurts my heart but the road to burnout is paved with context switching and we don’t want that. My new goal in life —after getting a breakfast platter named after me— is to be so bored I have time to read a magazine subscription.\nNew hires and new features\nAn exciting month at the job. We managed to hire two talented folks who are going to help us build the future of Luro. One person is already onboarded and one arrives next week.\nHiring people is a lot of work. Who knew. All worth it, of course. First off, as a business, you need to know how you’re going to assess the skills and “fit” of a person. In Good to Great, Jim Collins calls this “getting the right people on the bus”, but ethically you also want to do that in a way that’s as fair and unbiased as possible. To me, this means establishing a standard interview template (with some flexibility) and devising a grading system. This complete guide to job interviewing was helpful but you need to mix in some engineering specifics.\nThen you need to comb backlogs, perform mini-explorations of near-future features, speculate far off features; all to figure out your exact skill gaps and what types of roles might fill those gaps.\nThen you need to determine if a job candidate’s skills match those gaps. This is hard for me, because I optimistically believe everyone has potential to figure out everything, but in startup land, that time and runway is somewhat precious.\nThen, if you make a hire, before they show up you have to:\n\nMake sure all your documentation is up-to-snuff\nMake sure the local dev environment stands up in minutes and not days\nCreate some Good First Issue tickets\nDevise some low- to high-challenge tasks for ramping up, hopefully providing exposure to critical parts of the application\nEstablish clear and concrete goals and objectives\n\nI’ve also decided that for every new hire I’m going make sure all module dependencies and Node versions are as updated as possible, so those problems don’t create a bad first install experience. Thinking about the “user experience” of employee onboarding is possibly overkill but it’s something I’d like to do well if possible.\nIn a couple weeks everyone will be fully onboarded and back from vacation. I’m excited to see the lights turn on in the engineering department. In fact, with the help of our newest hire we were able to build out a new feature that we think is going to make a big impact and become a centerpiece to the application. Good vibes all around.

      "summary": "In Austin we have three types of trash: trash, recycling, and compost. And then if I’m honest there’s a fourth and fifth variety: e-waste and a bag of old clothes and toys to donate. The big three live outside in the side yard and those last two live in piles in my garage until I can’t handle looking at them anymore.\nThe side yard has three enormous trash bins. The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem. Our recycling… well, our recycling is always full and overflowing. You see, we’re bottlenecked by the city’s two week pick up cycle. When the bin fills up we create staging areas with paper bags to triage the excess recycling. The minute the city hauls off the previous load, we’ve filled up half of our capacity on our next two week cycle.\nThere’s piles of recycling TODOs all over my house, not in a hoarder way, but in a shabby chic, mid-century modern meets the reality of a pandemic way. French country. Chip n’ Jo.\nThe big issue is our recycle bin is DDoS’d by cardboard from Amazon. All those great ideas that came with boxes inside boxes. The swells of orders at birthdays and holidays. Those gifts become a hazard. Boxes on top of boxes because if you prematurely optimize and flatten them they get more slippery and you fall on them. It creates pressure and stress on the in-home recycling operation. Time and mental energy spent on sorting, squashing, grouping, cutting, and planning what can go out in the next week’s load.\nI hear I can add capacity by calling the city and requesting a second recycling bin. That seems like a lot to always have a fourth enormous trashcan sitting around. I don’t need that much capacity. Or do I?\nThe city allows me to bundle my boxes as a strategy. If I cut up all the boxes into 2ft×2ft flat pieces and tie that up, I can set that next to the recycling and the city will pick it up. It’s a lot of work to prepare that and any threat of rain will leave you with a soggy mess.\nI can add temporary capacity from gracious neighbors. I’d use their garbage cans and pay them back with confections, hoping I don’t burn through the goodwill. This is probably the simplest solution, but also a lot of work for trash.\nTo top it all off, there’s a rumor going around that none of the recycling ever gets recycled. They say it goes to the landfill because China quit buying our trash. I hate it, but kind of believe it.\nAnyways, backlogs.",

Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.\nYou see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” = yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” = yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” = yes, even cooler. “DAOs let communities have ownership in the projects they like” = yes, in theory1. At its core, even the basic idea of a sci-fi reality where we zlorp our space credits to each other on our holo-visors seems like a probable eventuality.\nFrom Easter 2020 to Easter 2021 I watched in my Stocks app as the price of $ETH went from $180 to $2230 (+1,288%)  and $SOL went from $0.60 to $31.70 (+5,221%). Dang. Regret. I should have bought. But two weeks later I watched as both of those coins lost 50% of their value overnight. Phew.

I needed to pull the trigger.\nAfter gut-checking with friends (who were like “Sure, man”), my wife (who to this day says, “I don’t get it”), my financial advisor (who was like 😬), and doing my own research… I decided not to pull the trigger.

      "title": "Thoughts on spectrums",
      "summary": "One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.\nTake color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.\n\nThe rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.\nIn design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel, an infinitely wrapping spectrum of rainbow colors.\n\nA beautiful rainbow circle, I hope my computer is okay.\nThen… we learn about saturation. Colors can be vibrant and saturated or duller and unsaturated shades. You can tune color wheels to provide this effect, but for the best representation of color saturation, we need another axis as if color exists on an XY chart.\n\nThus color pickers! The horizontal X-axis reflects the hue across the ROYGBIV spectrum and the vertical Y-axis reflects the saturation. Adding another dimension helps explain color and saturation in a single image. Two axes are better than one.\nBut look! On this particular color picker there’s a slider to control another aspect of color: lightness, a way to tint a color lighter and darker. This hints that our XY plot isn’t enough.\nThis is where math and algorithmic representations of colors and lightwaves start coming into play. On the web, we can express over 16 million colors using a mix of red, green and blue pixels or expressing a color in an alternate method of combining hue, saturation and lightness; each three properties, three dimensions of differentiation. We actually need three axes to visualize our color possibilities which we can do in a three dimensional space.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe RGB color space looks like a gay Rubik’s cube and the HSL color space looks like a birthday cake drenched in icing. Each color-space (RGB, HSL, CMYK, Lab, etc) has its own different space of representable colors! The algorithm for each color-space gives us a different perspective. David Briggs has a collection of renderings of color spaces next to each other.\n\nThe shape of the color space is somewhat dependent on the math and algorithmic shorthand used by the color profile to derive the colors. Steve Eddins generated a beautiful rendering of a rotation of the Lab color-space and it’s one of my favorite renderings I’ve come across.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere’s more color spaces to explore! I found an old app for Windows called Gamutvision that tries to visualize these color spaces. John Austin explains the mathematical history of color spaces. Craig Hockenberry —who wrote a book on color—  wrote about Apple’s new wide-gamut displays and links to an even more in-depth look at color gamuts on Mac. There’s newer and wider gamuts on the horizon too, colors we’ve never seen on the screen before!\nPeople see color differently. Not just that they bought a nice TV or phone with a wider-gamut and more accurate algorithm, but also due to a variety of cultural or physiological differences as well.\n\nIn Japan they call the color of their verdant bamboo mountains, leafy green vegetables, green apples, and the color of the “go” signal on a traffic light; 青 (blue). I learned the history of this in college, but it always caught me by surprise an entire nation could be so collectively wrong… or was I the one who was wrong in that particular cultural setting?\nPersonal perspective factors in too, even factoring out colorblindness. My wife calls the international walk signal pictogram “the blue walking man” and while it does have a blue-ish tint, I guffaw because it’s clearly white. And don’t get me started about the color of a tennis ball; she insists it’s “fluorescent green” and I recognize it as the color “fluorescent yellow” —as in “optic yellow”, the literal color name for a tennis ball— but it’s hard to say who’s right. We’re not alone in our disagreement and the Wikipedia page for tennis ball is now locked after hundreds of edit wars over dozens of years.\nSo that’s color. It can be a spectrum and you wouldn’t be wrong, but the possibilities of color are more accurately modeled in a multi-dimensional space. I’m not anti-spectrum, they’re an improvement over binaries, but they rarely sum up the entire issue at hand. Factor in your culture’s understanding of color or your personal understanding of color via the rods and cones in your eyeballs… color is both extremely objective and extremely subjective. And on a computer, the hardware algorithm that is showing you the colors might also limit your perception of color.\nAnyways, those are my thoughts on spectrums. I feel you can apply multi-dimensional thinking to a lot of ideas: good vs. evil, gender, politics, disabilities, technology choices, kanbans, video game character balance, and the list goes on. Your mileage may vary, but I think there’s one thing we can all agree on; most dichotomies are false. 😉",

      "content_text": "One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.\nTake color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.\n\nThe rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.\nIn design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel, an infinitely wrapping spectrum of rainbow colors.\n\nA beautiful rainbow circle, I hope my computer is okay.\nThen… we learn about saturation. Colors can be vibrant and saturated or duller and unsaturated shades. You can tune color wheels to provide this effect, but for the best representation of color saturation, we need another axis as if color exists on an XY chart.\n\nThus color pickers! The horizontal X-axis reflects the hue across the ROYGBIV spectrum and the vertical Y-axis reflects the saturation. Adding another dimension helps explain color and saturation in a single image. Two axes are better than one.\nBut look! On this particular color picker there’s a slider to control another aspect of color: lightness, a way to tint a color lighter and darker. This hints that our XY plot isn’t enough.\nThis is where math and algorithmic representations of colors and lightwaves start coming into play. On the web, we can express over 16 million colors using a mix of red, green and blue pixels or expressing a color in an alternate method of combining hue, saturation and lightness; each three properties, three dimensions of differentiation. We actually need three axes to visualize our color possibilities which we can do in a three dimensional space.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe RGB color space looks like a gay Rubik’s cube and the HSL color space looks like a birthday cake drenched in icing. Each color-space (RGB, HSL, CMYK, Lab, etc) has its own different space of representable colors! The algorithm for each color-space gives us a different perspective. David Briggs has a collection of renderings of color spaces next to each other.\n\nThe shape of the color space is somewhat dependent on the math and algorithmic shorthand used by the color profile to derive the colors. Steve Eddins generated a beautiful rendering of a rotation of the Lab color-space and it’s one of my favorite renderings I’ve come across.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere’s more color spaces to explore!

      "summary": "April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.\nA new lawn\n\nMy wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.\nSurprise remodeling project! Setting the landscape (heh), while the existing landscaping was wonderful and charming, in practice it didn’t work well for our family. My wife and I worked hard to narrow the scope and priority of the projects we needed done.\nProject #1: The front yard\nThe front yard zeroscape treatment featured two amoeba-shaped rings of grass surrounded by crushed granite rocks. Modern, low maintenance, but the slope of the front yard causes all those rocks wash into the street every time it rains. I get the joy of looking like an asshole once a month shoveling the rocks from the street back into my yard. Project #1: Replace rocks with grass.\nWe also needed some concrete steps, but I didn’t want to blow the scope of the project and delay it further by mixing trades, so this was #4 on our list of priorities.\nProject #2: The rock pit\nIn the backyard I worked hard to remove a big area of english ivy and revealed a rock pit. Yikes. A haven for snakes, roaches, and mosquitos. I removed the rocks and thankfully my other neighbor Jason took some of those rocks, but I still had two mounds of dirt surrounding the pit that must have been a pond at some point. Now every kid loves a rock pit to play in, but a flat patch of grass would be more useful to our family. Project #2: Fill pit with dirt and cover with grass.\nProject #3: The side yard\nOn the side yard, we had another english ivy zone that didn’t do much other than eat lost toys. Ideally this could be usable space where we could park our garbage cans or possibly another camper one day. This was a stretch goal. Project  #3: Convert ivy side yard to a crushed granite pad.\nI love it when a plan comes together\nI was happy to do this all as separate projects over different months, but José and his crew made some on the fly decisions that tied the projects together and made everything more efficient.\nThey removed the rocks from the front yard (Project #1) and dumped them in the side yard (Project #3). Then they took the dirt mounds from the rock pit (Project #2) and used that as fill for the front yard where the rocks were (Project #1). After about two days of work, we were ready for the four pallets of sod.\nAs we were preparing for the grass, José said he knew a concrete guy. A couple of quick conversations and we were pouring concrete within the week. The total turnaround time on the entire project was about 2 weeks. In the blink of an eye, I had a new front and back yard.\nSt. Augustine is a hearty stubborn grass that grows well here in Texas. It’s a bit water-hungry and I know that’s going to bite me in the upcoming Water Wars, but I think grass was a good choice and my microbiome seems to support it (we were the only rock yard on the street). And the results seem to have had a cooling effect on the whole property. The other grass seems happier, the trees seem happier, I’m happier; it works.\nThere’s a sense of relief and pride that comes with finishing a project that’s been on your dockett for years. We now have a usable front yard that doesn’t stab your feet as you run out to grab something from the car barefoot. With the shed, the flattened lawn, and the trampoline, we now have the backyard we’ve envisioned for awhile. It’s all come together. That project’s done. Next we battle the mosquitos.\nMy web component workshop and my web component talk\nThe second week of April I headed up to Minneapolis to do my Frontend Masters workshop. My whole year so far had been working towards that, so there’s a sense of relief to have that checked off my to-do list. A months worth of nights and weekends went into preparing the course, building an entire online guidebook for the course, and making slides. Then for that workshop day you have to upload an internet’s worth of know-how into your “Brain RAM”, it’s a bit overwhelming. But I think it went well, I learned a lot about giving workshops, and I look forward to people’s feedback when the course gets released.\nThe next week I did my web components talk at An Event Apart and a LIVE ShopTalk as well. The crew at An Event Apart work hard to put on a good conference. Wil Reynolds’s talk on SEO keeps rattling around in my brain the most. He spoke about how the context of words change when they’re next to other words, and if you manage to win the keyword lottery how do you meet customers expectations by delivering on those words. You should find this talk, I’m not doing it justice. Thanks again to AEA for having me.\nThus ends this spring conference season for me. I haven’t made any hard decisions about speaking at future conferences, but I am acknowledging to myself they are a tough fit for me and my life right now while starting a new company (Luro). As I understand my chaos brain a bit more, diverting extra brain cycles to prepare a talk while doing my job, life, kids, etc was a skill… but now it’s a pretty risky maneuver to add to the Jenga tower of obligations without careful consideration.\nBaseball and the suburban life\nWe are deep into the shuttling kids around to their activities lifestyle. While my wife does most of this, I spent a lot of April evenings down at the baseball fields with my son Otis.

      "content_html": "<p>April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.</p>\n<h2>A new lawn</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2022/lawn.jpg\" alt=\"My front yard\" /></p>\n<p>My wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.</p>\n<p>Surprise remodeling project! Setting the landscape (heh), while the existing landscaping was wonderful and charming, in practice it didn’t work well for our family. My wife and I worked hard to narrow the scope and priority of the projects we needed done.</p>\n<h3>Project #1: The front yard</h3>\n<p>The front yard zeroscape treatment featured two amoeba-shaped rings of grass surrounded by crushed granite rocks. Modern, low maintenance, but the slope of the front yard causes all those rocks wash into the street every time it rains. I get the joy of looking like an asshole once a month shoveling the rocks from the street back into my yard. <strong>Project #1: Replace rocks with grass.</strong></p>\n<p>We also needed some concrete steps, but I didn’t want to blow the scope of the project and delay it further by mixing trades, so this was #4 on our list of priorities.</p>\n<h3>Project #2: The rock pit</h3>\n<p>In the backyard I worked hard to remove a big area of english ivy and revealed a rock pit. Yikes. A haven for snakes, roaches, and mosquitos. I removed the rocks and thankfully my other neighbor Jason took some of those rocks, but I still had two mounds of dirt surrounding the pit that must have been a pond at some point. Now every kid loves a rock pit to play in, but a flat patch of grass would be more useful to our family. <strong>Project #2: Fill pit with dirt and cover with grass.</strong></p>\n<h3>Project #3: The side yard</h3>\n<p>On the side yard, we had another english ivy zone that didn’t do much other than eat lost toys. Ideally this could be usable space where we could park our garbage cans or possibly another camper one day. This was a stretch goal. <strong>Project  #3: Convert ivy side yard to a crushed granite pad.</strong></p>\n<h3>I love it when a plan comes together</h3>\n<p>I was happy to do this all as separate projects over different months, but José and his crew made some on the fly decisions that tied the projects together and made everything more efficient.</p>\n<p>They removed the rocks from the front yard (Project #1) and dumped them in the side yard (Project #3). Then they took the dirt mounds from the rock pit (Project #2) and used that as fill for the front yard where the rocks were (Project #1). After about two days of work, we were ready for the four pallets of sod.</p>\n<p>As we were preparing for the grass, José said he knew a concrete guy. A couple of quick conversations and we were pouring concrete within the week. The total turnaround time on the entire project was about 2 weeks. In the blink of an eye, I had a new front and back yard.</p>\n<p>St. Augustine is a hearty stubborn grass that grows well here in Texas. It’s a bit water-hungry and I know that’s going to bite me in the upcoming Water Wars, but I think grass was a good choice and my microbiome seems to support it (we were the only rock yard on the street). And the results seem to have had a cooling effect on the whole property. The other grass seems happier, the trees seem happier, I’m happier; it works.</p>\n<p>There’s a sense of relief and pride that comes with finishing a project that’s been on your dockett for years. We now have a usable front yard that doesn’t stab your feet as you run out to grab something from the car barefoot. With the shed, the flattened lawn, and the trampoline, we now have the backyard we’ve envisioned for awhile. It’s all come together. That project’s done. Next we battle the mosquitos.</p>\n<h2>My web component workshop and my web component talk</h2>\n<p>The second week of April I headed up to Minneapolis to do my <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/\">Frontend Masters</a> workshop. My whole year so far had been working towards that, so there’s a sense of relief to have that checked off my to-do list. A months worth of nights and weekends went into preparing the course, building an entire online guidebook for the course, and making slides. Then for that workshop day you have to upload an internet’s worth of know-how into your “Brain RAM”, it’s a bit overwhelming. But I think it went well, I learned a lot about giving workshops, and I look forward to people’s feedback when the course gets released.</p>\n<p>The next week I did my web components talk at An Event Apart and a <a href=\"https://shoptalkshow.com/513/\">LIVE ShopTalk</a> as well. The crew at An Event Apart work hard to put on a good conference. Wil Reynolds’s talk on SEO keeps rattling around in my brain the most. He spoke about how the context of words change when they’re next to other words, and if you manage to win the keyword lottery how do you meet customers expectations by delivering on those words. You should find this talk, I’m not doing it justice. Thanks again to AEA for having me.</p>\n<p>Thus ends this spring conference season for me. I haven’t made any hard decisions about speaking at future conferences, but I am acknowledging to myself they are a tough fit for me and my life right now while starting a new company (Luro). As I understand my chaos brain a bit more, diverting extra brain cycles to prepare a talk while doing my job, life, kids, etc was a skill… but now it’s a pretty risky maneuver to add to the Jenga tower of obligations without careful consideration.</p>\n<h2>Baseball and the suburban life</h2>\n<p>We are deep into the shuttling kids around to their activities lifestyle. While my wife does most of this, I spent a lot of April evenings down at the baseball fields with my son Otis. I didn’t know if he’d every want to try baseball again after COVID cancelled his first season of baseball.

You may have noticed something is a little fishy about this data.\nBefore I jump to any conclusions, I wanted to check my data with their sources.\nFeedback from Fathom and Netlify\nI tweeted about this phenomenon in 2019…\nServer-side @netlify stats vs. Client-side @usefathom stats (over the last ~4 weeks)439k pageviews vs 12.5k pageviews44k uniques vs. 7.9k uniques pic.twitter.com/ARoW82BhAm— Dave Rupert (@davatron5000) July 11, 2019 \nAfter tweeting about it Netlify and Fathom both reached out to me. It’s a bit of a he-said/she-said situation about who’s data is most correct, but some high-level notes add value to the conversation.\n\nFathom’s point of view was that I was on the outdated community product and the SaaS product is much better and more accurate now. I don’t doubt the paid product is better, but I do doubt it would close the 18× gap on the Netlify numbers.\nNetlify’s take was pretty matter-of-fact. “Yup. This reflects the log data.” They’re not wrong, raw server logs don’t lie. Their investigation into the matter turned up two anomalies I can’t solve:\n\n80% of the hits to my Responsive Deliverables post contain a utm_campaign= query param, which tells me people love my footnote about SMACSS. Some bot (in Germany?) must be hammering that campaign URL.\nThere’s a Google Cloud Uptime Monitor health check pointed at my site. This is helpful, except that I never set one up! Another rogue bot (in Germany?) is pinging my old content thousands of times a day.\n\n\n\nFathom’s numbers seem more believable but Netlify’s data eliminates any ad blocking questions. My one small takeaway is that it’d be nice if I could filter out known bot traffic from Netlify’s reporting. That might remove the delta to an acceptable degree.\nBig conclusions about data-driven decision making\nThe data tells me I get somewhere between 12k and 26k visitors to my site who open anywhere between 18k and 333k pages. If I stare at the larger numbers, that is impressive but not actionable. Comparing 2019 to 2022, Netlify is showing a 25% drop in pageviews and a 41% drop in uniques, while Fathom is showing almost the inverse.\nThis isn’t a judgement on Netlify or Fathom, they are both incredible services that offer incredible analytics products. But it leaves me in a position of wondering who should I believe?\nMy trust level in analytics products is low\nMy trust in analytics data is at an all-time low. Browser-level privacy improvements, ad blockers, and bot traffic have obliterated the data integrity. Unless I’m a certified statistician, I’m unable to accurately assess traffic to my breakfast table.\nI used to believe people were honest, but seeing all this bot traffic on my little site I could see how someone might point bots at their own site to inflate their traffic stats, gain perceived popularity, which they then pass on to advertisers. My ad vendor’s FAQ page has a note that says “Bots account for as much as 80% of website traffic”, yikes.\nData-driven decisions can be a blindspot\nIf I believed Netlify’s data as gospel, I would be a blogging sensation! I should quit my job and do blogging fulltime. Four million eyeballs per year. Following Netlify’s data to its logical extreme, I should be structuring my new blogging business like so:\n\nWriting a lot of content about responsive design and 4K monitors.\nInvesting  a lot in German and Finnish localized content.\nI’d should be in full panic mode about my 41% drop in uniques.\n\nI love Germany (and I hear Finland is great), but I suspect they’re not my #1 and #2 markets. And those vintage 2014 posts are okay, but should not be the core of my content strategy.\nIf I, or some hypothetical manager, put too much stock into these metrics I could see it causing a firestorm of reprioritization based on bot traffic1. We’d be chasing the tail of a health check bot somewhere in Germany.\nThe point is, you can enter a McNamara Fallacy if you base your business solely on quantitative data.\nYou need more than just metrics\nProbably old advice, but you need a mixture of quantitative AND qualitative data to make good decisions. In Just Enough Research, Erika Hall drives home a point that I think applies here:\n\nYou want to know what is happening (qualitative), how much it’s happening (quantitative) and why it’s happening (qualitative).\n\nIf your goal is to grow your product, you need a mixture of research (academic and applied), user tests, A/B tests, analytics, performance audits2, accessibility audits3, and a plethora of other considerations. Even if you have all those processes in place, I still think you need a human — a sage — who can read the tea leaves and interpret the data in a way that the business understands.\nIf your goal is not to grow your site… maybe ignorance is bliss.\n\n\n\nMaybe pointing a bot army at a competitor’s site to skew metrics is some next level Art of War shit. ↩\n\n\nEvery 100ms of latency costs Amazon 1% of sales (source) /via WPO Stats ↩\n\n\n1 in 4 adults in the United States have a disability (source) /via A11y Project ↩\n\n\n",

      "summary": "Howdy! If you frequent this website often, you’ll notice some changes. This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.\n~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.\nWithout further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…\nWebsite feature inventory\nHere’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:\n\n330+ blog posts\nArt-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SVGs\nOpen Graph images (handmade)\nsitemap.xml\nRSS feed\n███ ████\nCode samples\nCodepen, YouTube, and Vimeo embeds\nAbout Timeline (YAML-powered)\nBookshelf (YAML-powered)\nLikes (RSS-powered)\n/uses page\nService worker + offline page\n\nMy checks are all manual right now, but not rocket science. I created a “secret” page to roll up all my art-directed posts and I’m happy to report just a few are super fucked up. One day I’ll add proper visual integration tests, but today is not that day.\nWhich leads me to the next step, let’s define the goals and non-goals for this project so we can finish on time.\nGoals and non-goals\nThe goals I have outlined for myself are pretty simple:\n\nRedo my typography setup - After years and years of subtle tweaks, I ruined it. Time to start over, more fluid this time.\nNew homepage - This is the lowest priority, but nothing sings “redesign” like a new homepage.\nRemove Ads - Ads make me ~$20/mo. Originally a motivator to blog consistently, I’ve got a flow now. Ads were also an intentional third-party constraint I used to inform client work. Since I’m moving away from client work, that experiment can end.\n✅ Remove Fathom Analytics - Fathom is great, but I’m paying $5/mo to self-host and I check it zero times a year. I have Netlify’s server-side analytics running on this as well. There’s a 26× disparity between those two analytics services, enough to make me think there’s no truth to metrics at all. Jim Nielsen covers this phenomenon in his post Comparing Data in Google and Netlify Analytics.\n✅ Expose tags - I want to do a better job at tagging and categorization of posts for my own sake and I think elevating that will help.\n✅ Annual stats -  Another feature for me, I like to keep track of my progress over time.\n✅ Syntax Highlighting - I had this once with client-side Prism.js, then I took it off, now I want it back. I’m using server-side Rouge + Commonmark in Jekyll.\n✅ Support page - How can you give me $10? If I’m removing ads, might as well sell my own products and services.\n\nMy list of non-goals would include:\n\nDo not replatform the blog to Eleventy (or Astro) or whatever. I’d love to not be on Jekyll, but that’s a separate project. Tooling is a lot better on a Node stack.\nDo not go down a testing rabbit hole. Spot checks or automated webperf/accessibility tests would be beneficial, but it’d be easier on a Node stack.\nDo not automate opengraph images - Auto-generated opengraph images would be rad, but again, easier on a Node stack.\n\nWith those parameters defined, let’s do a status check…\nStatus check!\nWhat you’re looking at now is the lightly styled bones of my site. No Sass, no JavaScript, nothing but Jekyll static site compilation. I’m pleased with how the website is shaping up with basic browser defaults. I’ve got ~2.37kb of global CSS (926b gzipped) and I don’t see the need for much beyond that.\nRIP Newshammer, long live Newshammer: Astute readers will notice Newshammer is not on the site anymore. That’s not a permanent decision, but I am leaving opportunity/room to do something different.\nTypography: I’m embracing browser defaults for type right now, with two or three exceptions. I’m soft-committing to system-ui for now because I had some recent trouble rendering headings in other languages. The article H1 is the only heading I see that feels a little too small, but I’d be happy if that’s all the typesetting I need to do.\nSpacing: I have seven margin declarations and most of those are resets. Liberal usage of Grid and Flexbox using gap to manage consistent spacing. Super happy about this. Even the posts are one giant grid. I may abstract my grids into some layout utility classes…\n.layout-grid { --gap: 1.5rem; display: grid; gap: var(--gap); }\n.layout-grid > * { min-width: 0; } /* https://daverupert.com/2017/09/breaking-the-grid/ */\n.layout-grid[data-vibe=\"compact\"]     { --gap: 0.75rem }\n.layout-grid[data-vibe=\"comfortable\"] { --gap: 3rem }\n\nThis would probably remove half my existing CSS.\nCharts n’ graphs: I followed Josh Collinsworth’s post on CSS Grid bar charts for my Archive page. Happy with this. It needs some work to be fully accessible (context-less labels) but it’s presentational at its core.\nThe flagpole: One stylized component I have right now is the “flagpole” look for my Post Archives and About Timeline. I’m not attached to the flagpole treatment, but I do think visually grouping content by years is super helpful.\nBeyond that, I’ve already been able to land some accessibility fixes around my document heading structure which I’m pretty glad about. I noticed my HTML is also “over-classed” with a lot of half-baked .hentry microformats that I brought over from WordPress ten years ago, I’m looking forward to mowing those down.\nThat’s all I have for now.

This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.\n~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.\nWithout further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…\nWebsite feature inventory\nHere’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:\n\n330+ blog posts\nArt-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SVGs\nOpen Graph images (handmade)\nsitemap.xml\nRSS feed\n███ ████\nCode samples\nCodepen, YouTube, and Vimeo embeds\nAbout Timeline (YAML-powered)\nBookshelf (YAML-powered)\nLikes (RSS-powered)\n/uses page\nService worker + offline page\n\nMy checks are all manual right now, but not rocket science. I created a “secret” page to roll up all my art-directed posts and I’m happy to report just a few are super fucked up. One day I’ll add proper visual integration tests, but today is not that day.\nWhich leads me to the next step, let’s define the goals and non-goals for this project so we can finish on time.\nGoals and non-goals\nThe goals I have outlined for myself are pretty simple:\n\nRedo my typography setup - After years and years of subtle tweaks, I ruined it. Time to start over, more fluid this time.\nNew homepage - This is the lowest priority, but nothing sings “redesign” like a new homepage.\nRemove Ads - Ads make me ~$20/mo. Originally a motivator to blog consistently, I’ve got a flow now. Ads were also an intentional third-party constraint I used to inform client work. Since I’m moving away from client work, that experiment can end.\n✅ Remove Fathom Analytics - Fathom is great, but I’m paying $5/mo to self-host and I check it zero times a year. I have Netlify’s server-side analytics running on this as well. There’s a 26× disparity between those two analytics services, enough to make me think there’s no truth to metrics at all. Jim Nielsen covers this phenomenon in his post Comparing Data in Google and Netlify Analytics.\n✅ Expose tags - I want to do a better job at tagging and categorization of posts for my own sake and I think elevating that will help.\n✅ Annual stats -  Another feature for me, I like to keep track of my progress over time.\n✅ Syntax Highlighting - I had this once with client-side Prism.js, then I took it off, now I want it back. I’m using server-side Rouge + Commonmark in Jekyll.\n✅ Support page - How can you give me $10? If I’m removing ads, might as well sell my own products and services.\n\nMy list of non-goals would include:\n\nDo not replatform the blog to Eleventy (or Astro) or whatever. I’d love to not be on Jekyll, but that’s a separate project. Tooling is a lot better on a Node stack.\nDo not go down a testing rabbit hole. Spot checks or automated webperf/accessibility tests would be beneficial, but it’d be easier on a Node stack.\nDo not automate opengraph images - Auto-generated opengraph images would be rad, but again, easier on a Node stack.\n\nWith those parameters defined, let’s do a status check…\nStatus check!\nWhat you’re looking at now is the lightly styled bones of my site. No Sass, no JavaScript, nothing but Jekyll static site compilation. I’m pleased with how the website is shaping up with basic browser defaults. I’ve got ~2.37kb of global CSS (926b gzipped) and I don’t see the need for much beyond that.\nRIP Newshammer, long live Newshammer: Astute readers will notice Newshammer is not on the site anymore. That’s not a permanent decision, but I am leaving opportunity/room to do something different.\nTypography: I’m embracing browser defaults for type right now, with two or three exceptions. I’m soft-committing to system-ui for now because I had some recent trouble rendering headings in other languages. The article H1 is the only heading I see that feels a little too small, but I’d be happy if that’s all the typesetting I need to do.\nSpacing: I have seven margin declarations and most of those are resets. Liberal usage of Grid and Flexbox using gap to manage consistent spacing. Super happy about this. Even the posts are one giant grid. I may abstract my grids into some layout utility classes…\n.layout-grid { --gap: 1.5rem; display: grid; gap: var(--gap); }\n.layout-grid > * { min-width: 0; } /* https://daverupert.com/2017/09/breaking-the-grid/ */\n.layout-grid[data-vibe=\"compact\"]     { --gap: 0.75rem }\n.layout-grid[data-vibe=\"comfortable\"] { --gap: 3rem }\n\nThis would probably remove half my existing CSS.\nCharts n’ graphs: I followed Josh Collinsworth’s post on CSS Grid bar charts for my Archive page. Happy with this. It needs some work to be fully accessible (context-less labels) but it’s presentational at its core.\nThe flagpole: One stylized component I have right now is the “flagpole” look for my Post Archives and About Timeline. I’m not attached to the flagpole treatment, but I do think visually grouping content by years is super helpful.\nBeyond that, I’ve already been able to land some accessibility fixes around my document heading structure which I’m pretty glad about. I noticed my HTML is also “over-classed” with a lot of half-baked .hentry microformats that I brought over from WordPress ten years ago, I’m looking forward to mowing those down.\nThat’s all I have for now. Tune in next week for more changes and CSS riffin’!",

Overkill, I know, but it’s my overkill and it’s already helping me set some sights on personal and professional goals.\nThe biggest paradigm shift from PARA is the idea that projects have an end date. This is hard for me; a person who tends to have a lot of open-ended, never-ending projects. I’ve logged those never-ending projects like open source, podcasting, or gaming as “Areas” for now, but that feels a bit mismatched because they do require recurring participation.

      "summary": "Providing visibility into your work is one of the most underrated developer soft skills. Coworkers are often too busy to keep track of what’s going on with engineering work, even if it’s their job to know what’s going on with engineering work. It’s generally not out of malice or lack of interest, but a lack of time and energy to chase down every issue or conversation thread. And to be fair, engineering is an opaque process where we trick the rocks inside a computer to act like a business.\nStandups are a great tool for sharing visibility. Unfortunately, not everyone loves standups. I’ve personally experienced some extremely toxic scrum master situations. Impersonal bots can have the same effect. A daily status report can feel like micromangement leading to a loss of autonomy. Also, that visibility into your work evaporates after attendees leave the call.\nFor the past four or five years, I’ve been practicing an alternative to daily standups. Rather than waiting for people to confront you, I find it better to proactively share your progress in a brief bulleted list1 in a public channel (of appropriate level). That’s the secret: share without being asked. The template has evolved a bit over the years, but here’s what it looks like now:\n💪 **Progress**\n- Fixed something project#123\n- Added something project#234\n- Documented something\n\n😖 **Regressions**\n- Found bug on something project#345\n\n🧪 **Prototypes**\n- Experimented with new feature codepen.io/123\n\n💬 **To Discuss**\n- Blocked on something project#456\n \n📆 **This Week**\n- Work on new feature project#567\n- Out of office on Friday\n\nThat’s a … uh … standup?\nYeah. It’s basically a standup in newsletter form. It could be the years working in a Japanese office talking, but I don’t hate standups. They are great for mind-melding.

      "title": "7 Web Component Tricks",
      "summary": "This week I finished my Frontend Masters Web Components Course. To market it celebrate that accomplishment, I wanted to share ~7 tips and tricks I’ve learned preparing my course or I feel aren’t super obvious about Web Components.\n1. You can manipulate props right on a Lit element\nThis may be something only I would do, but if you make an element with Lit that exposes its properties, you can edit those props externally using querySelector.\n<my-counter counter=\"3\"></my-counter>\n\n<script>\nconst myCounter = document.querySelector('my-counter')\nmyCounter.counter = 10\n</script>\n\n2. :host-context let’s you style an element based on its parent\nYou can use :host-context() to style an element based on its parent. Your HTML may look like this:\n<my-element></my-element>\n<div class=\"card\"><my-element></my-element></div>\n\nIn your CSS inside the Web Component, you have something like this:\n:host-context(.card) { background:pink; }\n:host-context(.card)::after { content: 'I’m in a card' }\n\nSee Example\n3. Declarative ShadowDOM\n<my-element>\n\t<template shadowroot=\"open\">\n\t  <p>I'm a spooky skeleton screen 💀</p>\n\t</template>\n</my-element>\n\nDeclarative Shadow DOM enables server-side rendering of Web Components, but one thing that’s not clear is your inlined template and the components actual template can be totally different.\nSee Example\n4. Open WC has a project starter\nIf you’re looking for a create-react-app for Web Components, the folks at Open WC have you covered.\nnpm init @open-wc\n\nYou get so much from this (local server, testing configs, a storybook, production rollup config, etc) but my favorite bit is from the sample component’s test file: it runs an accessibility audit on your Shadow DOM!\nit('passes the a11y audit', async () => {\n  const el = await fixture(html`<custom-element></custom-element>`);\n\n  await expect(el).shadowDom.to.be.accessible();\n});\n\nAccessibility out of the box! Nice.\n5. You can “rebrand” other people’s components.\nWant to mix and match components from different design systems but keep a consistent naming structure in your company? You can import a component and “rebrand” it or even add functionality.\nimport { CoolButton } from 'cool-design-system'\n\nclass OurButton extends CoolButton {\n\tconstructor { super() }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('our-button', OurButton)\n\n6. The Open WC Publishing Guides are cool\nThe OpenWC group also has some nice community guidelines for publishing Web Components.\n\n✅ Do publish latest standard EcmaScript\n✅ Do publish standard es modules\n✅ Do include \"main\": \"index.js\" and \"module\": \"index.js\" in your package.json\n✅ Do export element classes\n✅ Do export side effects separately\n✅ Do import 3rd party node modules with “bare” import specifiers\n✅ Do include file extensions in import specifiers\n❌ Do not optimize\n❌ Do not bundle\n❌ Do not minify\n❌ Do not use .mjs file extensions\n❌ Do not import polyfills\n\nThat’s helpful and hopefully provides a consistent experience, allowing for a consistent bundling story, and preventing weird footguns that might occur when trying to use other people’s Web Components in your project.\n7. You don’t need build tools until the very, very end.\nIf you want to write Web Components, you can write vanilla web components and use ES Modules to join them together. You can use a web component library like Lit with an import statement pointed at skypack.dev or unpkg.com. It’s super handy to get started with zero tooling.\nIf you want to install packages off of npm … you could try Import Maps … but otherwise you’ll need a local dev server (vite or @web/dev-server) that supports “bare import specifiers”.\nIt’s only when going to production that you need tooling specific to your site’s needs. TypeScript is optional, bundling is optional, minifying code is optional. From a Web Component perspective, these are all considered “application-level concerns” that happen at deployment time.\nRollup build script examples are out there, but Web Components don’t prescribe how to build your application, they don’t hitch you to an architecture. It could be a whole tree-shaken SPA (single page app), but Web Components also work well in a MPA (multi-page app) architecture. It’s up to you and your application to figure out what fits best.\nStay tuned for more Web Component content\nIf you want more Web Component content, stay tuned! I learned a bunch and it feels worth it to share.

You can manipulate props right on a Lit element</h2>\n<p>This may be something only I would do, but if you make an element with Lit that exposes its properties, you can edit those props externally using <code>querySelector</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"language-html highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;my-counter</span> <span class=\"na\">counter=</span><span class=\"s\">\"3\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/my-counter&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;script&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">myCounter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">querySelector</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">my-counter</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">myCounter</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">counter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<h2>2. :host-context let’s you style an element based on its parent</h2>\n<p>You can use <code>:host-context()</code> to style an element based on its parent. Your HTML may look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-html highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"html\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;my-element&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"card\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;my-element&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>In your CSS inside the Web Component, you have something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-css highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"css\"><span class=\"nd\">:host-context</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">.card</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nl\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"no\">pink</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nd\">:host-context</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">.card</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"nd\">::after</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nl\">content</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">'I’m in a card'</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/jOYKKPN\">See Example</a></p>\n<h2>3.

Open WC has a project starter</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking for a <code>create-react-app</code> for Web Components, the folks at Open WC have you covered.</p>\n<div class=\"language-html highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"html\">npm init @open-wc\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>You get so much from this (local server, testing configs, a storybook, production rollup config, etc) but my favorite bit is from the sample component’s test file: it runs an <a href=\"https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/chai-a11y-axe/\">accessibility audit</a> on your Shadow DOM!</p>\n<div class=\"language-jsx highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"jsx\"><span class=\"nx\">it</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">passes the a11y audit</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">async</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">el</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">await</span> <span class=\"nx\">fixture</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">html</span><span class=\"s2\">`&lt;custom-element&gt;&lt;/custom-element&gt;`</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n  <span class=\"k\">await</span> <span class=\"nx\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">el</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">shadowDom</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">to</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">be</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">accessible</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Accessibility out of the box! Nice.</p>\n<h2>5. You can “rebrand” other people’s components.</h2>\n<p>Want to mix and match components from different design systems but keep a consistent naming structure in your company? You can import a component and “rebrand” it or even add functionality.</p>\n<div class=\"language-jsx highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"jsx\"><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">CoolButton</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">cool-design-system</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nx\">OurButton</span> <span class=\"kd\">extends</span> <span class=\"nx\">CoolButton</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"kd\">constructor</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"k\">super</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">customElements</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">define</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">our-button</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">OurButton</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<h2>6. The Open WC Publishing Guides are cool</h2>\n<p>The OpenWC group also has some nice <a href=\"https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/publishing/\">community guidelines for publishing Web Components</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>✅ Do publish latest standard EcmaScript<br />\n✅ Do publish standard es modules<br />\n✅ Do include <code>&quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;module&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;</code> in your <code>package.json</code><br />\n✅ Do export element classes<br />\n✅ Do export side effects separately<br />\n✅ Do import 3rd party node modules with “bare” import specifiers<br />\n✅ Do include file extensions in import specifiers</p>\n<p>❌ Do not optimize<br />\n❌ Do not bundle<br />\n❌ Do not minify<br />\n❌ Do not use <code>.mjs</code> file extensions<br />\n❌ Do not import polyfills</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s helpful and hopefully provides a consistent experience, allowing for a consistent bundling story, and preventing weird footguns that might occur when trying to use other people’s Web Components in your project.</p>\n<h2>7. You don’t need build tools until the very, very end.</h2>\n<p>If you want to write Web Components, you can write vanilla web components and use ES Modules to join them together. You can use a web component library like Lit with an <code>import</code> statement pointed at <code>skypack.dev</code> or <code>unpkg.com</code>. It’s super handy to get started with zero tooling.</p>\n<p>If you want to install packages off of <code>npm</code> … you could try <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/import-maps\">Import Maps</a> … but otherwise you’ll need a local dev server (<code>vite</code> or <code>@web/dev-server</code>) that supports “bare import specifiers”.</p>\n<p>It’s only when going to production that you need tooling specific to your site’s needs. TypeScript is optional, bundling is optional, minifying code is optional. From a Web Component perspective, these are all considered “application-level concerns” that happen at deployment time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open-wc.org/docs/building/rollup/\">Rollup build script examples</a> are out there, but Web Components don’t prescribe how to build your application, they don’t hitch you to an architecture. It could be a whole tree-shaken SPA (single page app), but Web Components also work well in a MPA (multi-page app) architecture. It’s up to you and your application to figure out what fits best.</p>\n<h2>Stay tuned for more Web Component content</h2>\n<p>If you want more Web Component content, stay tuned! I learned a bunch and it feels worth it to share. Also, if you’re a visual learner, my Frontend Masters course should be up soon so keep a look out over there, I’ll also post about it here, don’t worry 😉</p>",

Why does that kid get to play with toys in the classroom and I don’t? … Different people, different ways.\nA simple enough refrain that if I start it, my kids will finish.\nAsk me in twenty years if it worked, but I think they already get that “fairness” can take different shapes when it’s centered around meeting different people’s different needs.\nI love him 'cause he's tiny and small\nI love you because you're yellow and tall\nTiny and small love\nYellow and tall love\nEveryone loves through all their days\nDifferent people, different ways\n\nI love him 'cause he has to be fed\nI love you because you make your own bed\nHe has to be fed love\nYou make your own bed love\nDifferent people, different ways\n\nI love him 'cause he's small and helpless\nHe has to be washed and fed each day\nI love you cause you're big and helpful\nYou can read, sing, and play\n\nI love him 'cause he's sugar and spice\nI love you because you're awfully nice\nSugar and spice love\nAwfully nice love\nTiny and small love\nYellow and tall love\nEveryone loves through all their days\nDifferent people, different ways\n\n\n\n\nBuffy Sainte Marie once once breastfed Cody on Sesame Street in a time when breastfeeding, let alone public breastfeeding, was socially unpopular.

For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone.

I agree with the premise, that you can figure out most problems, but the narrative frustrated me.\nThe Upside of Stress - This was my kind of book. Correcting old science with new science, adjacent scientific studies. Written by a PhD. I welcome the challenge to the societal mindset that stress kills.\n\n\n📺 TV, Movies, and Anime\n\nGundam II, Gundam III (Netflix)\n\n\n👾 Video games\n\nOlli Olli World\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes - We moved ShopTalk over to its own YouTube channel. It’s a minor but impactful change that will allow all ShopTalk content to exist in one home.\n\nNew ShopTalk YouTube Channel - Like and subscribe\nCSS Quiz Show - Chris and I did a couple of CSS quizzes.\n\n\n📝 Blogging - 6 posts, 3 new formats. I started doing end-of-week link roundups, a blogging series where I pretend I’m dying or about to quit tech, and a “songcatching” series where I share meaningful songs.\n\nFive links for a Friday afternoon\nBefore I go: When it comes to complaining about web browsers - Highest traffic post.\nSix end of week links\nBeen in this war for too long\nΤ’ακορντεόν\n原爆を許すまじ\n\n\n\nAlso… the ShopTalk Discord braintrust and I have determined that I need to redesign my website. Let it be recorded in the annals of time that process has begun.",

      "summary": "Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\n\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\n\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.\nThe 30 day fix\nThe 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.\nThere’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.\nBut… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.\n30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.\nExample: The case of the evolving API needs\nI built an API to retrieve posts from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.\nGET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n\nBut when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of post.title and post.id fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThen we needed to have a category filter on the /posts/lists endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nThis worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these /posts/list/:category queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a limit as a query param.\nGET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n\nAhh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need orderBy and groupBy params for sorting, include params for an ad-hoc JOIN of related records, ability to sort JOIN records; a little less rigidity in the design.\nWe — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation. With all the added options, the /posts/list endpoint is a mess — it may not even need to exist! — and we could solve a lot of problems by sitting down and thinking about the solution a little bit harder. But I actually don’t know if we made a mistake. We were running towards getting feedback. We don’t need a big infrastructure project when sandbags would fix the issue.\nTo build or over-build, that is the question\nIt’s a tough situation that comes down to estimating. Not estimating in a “choose some fake fibonacci numbers” sense, but in an overcoming personal biases sense. Are you over-estimating your need for the 30 day fix? Are you under-estimating how well the 15 minute fix is going to work? Are you operating emotionally out of a bad experience from a previous situation? Have you overcome your personal optimism bias? What’s the pressure from management like?\nOften you don’t know the scope of the problem until you have users, so over-building at the beginning of the process is probably a mistake. The 15 minute fix gets you closer to actually learning what your codebase needs. But months down the line, you have a codebase full of 15 minute fixes that now need 30 day upgrades. Time-bombs. Could you have saved time by architecting the 30 day fix from the beginning? Or could you have saved a lot of money by chipping away at the problem with more and more 15 minute fixes?\nAnd that’s what it comes down to: economics. A 15 minute fix and a 30 day fix have colossally different costs and impacts. Can your business afford that time? Can your users afford the delay? Is it a Monty Hall Rewrite problem where the fix could actually be worse once it’s landed? I struggle with this because I hate rework, but if you think of software as evolving, then rework and maintenance is part of the job.\nHow do you decide? I don’t know. The best advice I have is: Never go to the grocery store when you’re hungry… but y’know, for software.",

The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.\nWith the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.\n\nふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n\nThe city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world\n",

      "title": "Before I go: When it comes to complaining about web browsers",
      "summary": "I’m not planning on leaving the industry (yet), but before I go I’d like to offer up what I know when it comes to complaining about web browsers.\nI have logged hundreds of hours complaining about browsers on Twitter, on podcasts, and on this blog. I have logged thousands more hours trying to keep up with browsers and I frequently interact with people who write specs and make browsers. I have not been 100% successful in my efforts to get a <rupert> element as my legacy but I have learned a lot about giving feedback to web browsers.\nBrowsers are really complex\nEric Meyer recently put it very well…\n\n[W]eb browsers are actually 60fps+ rendering environments.  They’re First-Person Scrollers.\n\nWhen you complain about browsers, the first thing you must know is: Browsers are big, complex pieces of software that must run very, very, very fast.\n“Browsers should do _______” may sound like an easy feature, but have you considered that your idea might be a bad idea? Not just bad on paper, but bad on a bad for computers level. Browsers render the page at 60fps even while scrolling so your idea must work within a 4ms window… along with the million other tasks the browser is trying to do during that same 4ms window.\nTo get your feature implemented you’ll need either a giant pile of cash or the willing ear of someone who works on a browser. And then you’ll need lots of consensus. Browsers are an exercise in consensus building; getting consensus for features inside your company, then shop it to web developers, then with other browsers, then you have to run the gauntlet through the official W3C working group tracks on the path to standardization. It’s consensus all the way down. Lots of input and lots of compromises along the way.\nLet’s dig into some of the different ways we lay people can offer input and what I think works and doesn’t work based on past attempts.\nTalking shit doesn’t work\nComplaining on Twitter sure does feel good but it doesn’t do much other than burning bridges and burning through people’s patience. I guess you may also get hit with the mute button which is probably the opposite effect you were hoping for. Despite how good or valid your complaint is, combativeness results in immediate dismissal by your target audience… not once, but for years. People hold grudges for a shockingly long time.\nJokes, snark, and sarcasm walk a thin line too. Exhibit A: I know some people at Google are a bit salty with me because I made a dumb joke on Twitter about <toast>, AMP, and Chrome seemingly over-exerting its dominant market share position in 2019. The irony here is I actually like the <std-element> pathway, but my commentary (punditry?) didn’t help as I joined the pile on, which was so bad that no one wants to ever try shipping native web components ever again.\nBeing toxic and abusive to the people that make browsers doesn’t add to the conversation. One possible goal it might achieve is amplifying feelings of burnout in the people you’re hoping will adopt your cause. We don’t need to be naive about business incentives (e.g. AMP, App Store revenue, developer mindshare landgrabs, etc) but we can dial back the heat a bit.\nI recommend being specific about the features you need, curb the outrage.\nSaying “is the new IE” doesn’t work\nTo the previous point, lobbing general criticisms of monopolistic behaviors or constant out-of-datedness doesn’t help further the conversation. I agree that browsers probably need to go to court more for their behavior, but each browser company has its own historical baggage. Browser folk and fanboys will often deflect with whataboutism and invoke some kind of other finger pointing (Safari’s slow release cycle, Google’s data collection, Brave CEO’s support of California’s Prop 8 in 2007, Mozilla’s mass layoffs and dependency on Google Search money, Microsoft’s actual IE monopoly, etc). The criticism doesn’t land like it used to.\nI’d recommend being specific about what features are missing and what is holding you back.\nYelling about privacy sort of works\nPrivacy is important and can raise security flags, but invoking privacy like a boogeyman doesn’t go far. Privacy is such a big topic, people (and corporations) often have different perspectives on what qualifies as a privacy invasion. Raise the flag, yes, it’s important to yell about what’s important but don’t let them run off and decide what “privacy” means.\nIt’s better to be specific about what privacy measures you are requesting.\nAnd now for the best thing you could ever do…\nBlogging your specific problems works\nThe best thing I’ve ever done in my career is blog about my specific problems with browsers (or any software you’re passionate about). This goes for software beyond browsers too. I’ve done this for IE, Safari, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Windows 10, WSL and I’ve seen first hand how a “friction log” can become a powerful tool in an organization.\nBehind the scenes, your posts will get picked up by external-facing developer advocates and shared internally. A single blog post is worth 10,000 tweets. It’s valuable because it shows you thought through your problem and narrowed it down to a set of specific issues.

      "title": "Vibe Check №13",
      "summary": "Buckle up. This month turned out to be a big one. Writing it all out feels like an entire year went by, so I’ll start with the bad that happened at the beginning of the month and move towards the good.\nGot COVID\nWhen I posted my Vibe Check №12 and End of 2021 posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.\nThankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tell.\nI don’t plan on getting COVID again, but if there’s a silver lining, it’s that at least the general fear of getting it has gone away. But that’s a me-centric perspective when 887,780+ people have passed away from this thing.\nRest in peace, Jackson\nOn January 4th a friend of our family unexpectedly passed away. Jackson taught me a lot over the years and had a helluva life story. During the civil war in his home country of Liberia, he and some other boys were taken out and left in the desert to die. He survived and came to the US as a young boy in a shipping container. He married (later divorced) and had four wonderful kids. Despite the challenges in his life, he always had an impossible sense of hope which could brighten your day.\nThrough Jackson I saw first hand how difficult the US immigration system is when a single stain on your record makes you a target for deportation. No pathways, delayed work permits, years of unemployment, immigration lawyers fees, health issues, doctors bills; I saw how unfair the system was to him and his family.\nBut he loved his kids. Every ounce of concern and every penny he made went to providing for his kids. His kids are nearly grown up now, the first is going off to college on scholarship, and I know they’re going to miss him but I know they know how much he loved them. It’s a sad situation to lose a dedicated parent in high school. If you can spare a prayer for Jackson’s kids and our neighbor Cleo (who was like a mother to Jackson), thank you.\n2022 Mantras\nIt’s been a rough start to the year for sure, but we’re getting through it. I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.\n\n2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent) - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.\n2022: Be less disgusting - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.\n\nAnd for grown-ups, I got another one.\n\n2022: Buy your happiness - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.\n\nI hate how consumerist that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!\nEpisode 500 of ShopTalk\nI wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.\nAnd celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.\nI built my first Gunpla\n\nOn a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.\nMaking my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.\nI have a new ergonomic keyboard to build, a book of Frank Lloyd Wright kirigami papercraft models, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.\nAnother big refactor on Luro\nOne of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on Luro. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a tech de jour it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.\ntl;dr— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with boring technology, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers. Exciting days ahead.\nStatistics\nBecause I know these bulleted list breakdowns are the real reason you read these posts.\n\n💪 Fitness - Closed my rings 5 days this month\n\nBack doing Apple Fitness\nBack doing Pickleball, but I’ve lost a lot of skill after taking a month off\n\n\n📖 Reading\n\nPeril - Another Trump biography that juxtaposes him with Biden. Narrowing in on the final months of Trump’s presidency; his failed covid response, his election loss, his attempted coup. It’s not intended, but when Biden’s gaffs are next to Trump’s literal coup attempt, it creates some “both sides”-ism when those concerns aren’t even in the same galaxy. Is that a thing about books? You base content heirarchy on what’s before and what’s after?\nViolence. Speed.

      "content_html": "<p>Buckle up. This month turned out to be a big one. Writing it all out feels like an entire year went by, so I’ll start with the bad that happened at the beginning of the month and move towards the good.</p>\n<h2>Got COVID</h2>\n<p>When I posted my <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2021/12/vibe-check-12/\">Vibe Check №12</a> and <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2021/12/twenty-twentyone/\">End of 2021</a> posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.</p>\n<p>Thankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tell.</p>\n<p>I don’t plan on getting COVID again, but if there’s a silver lining, it’s that at least the general fear of getting it has gone away. But that’s a me-centric perspective when 887,780+ people have passed away from this thing.</p>\n<h2>Rest in peace, Jackson</h2>\n<p>On January 4th a friend of our family unexpectedly passed away. Jackson taught me a lot over the years and had a helluva life story. During the civil war in his home country of Liberia, he and some other boys were taken out and left in the desert to die. He survived and came to the US as a young boy in a shipping container. He married (later divorced) and had four wonderful kids. Despite the challenges in his life, he always had an impossible sense of hope which could brighten your day.</p>\n<p>Through Jackson I saw first hand how difficult the US immigration system is when a single stain on your record makes you a target for deportation. No pathways, delayed work permits, years of unemployment, immigration lawyers fees, health issues, doctors bills; I saw how unfair the system was to him and his family.</p>\n<p>But he loved his kids. Every ounce of concern and every penny he made went to providing for his kids. His kids are nearly grown up now, the first is going off to college on scholarship, and I know they’re going to miss him but I know they know how much he loved them. It’s a sad situation to lose a dedicated parent in high school. If you can spare a prayer for Jackson’s kids and our neighbor Cleo (who was like a mother to Jackson), thank you.</p>\n<h2>2022 Mantras</h2>\n<p>It’s been a rough start to the year for sure, but we’re getting through it. I find it’s good to have some operating principles for the year, so I’ve been workshopping some mantras with the kids. “2020: Learn to take a picture” didn’t pan out but I think we got some good ones this year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2022: Do stuff you can do (without a parent)</strong> - I love my kids but they need to learn how to get their own glass of water at this point.</li>\n<li><strong>2022: Be less disgusting</strong> - Whether it’s chewing with your mouth closed, not eating your boogers, or washing toothpaste down the sink instead of spitting it all over the bathroom counter… plenty of chances to be less disgusting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And for grown-ups, I got another one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2022: Buy your happiness</strong> - It could be 2 years of the pandemic talking, or it could be because I kinda quit Twitter, but I have a hair-trigger on impulse purchases these days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hate how <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/\">consumerist</a> that is, but it’s a vibe so I’m keeping it. I hate how everything costs money but I’m embracing it right now instead of fighting it. Let me know if you have a good mantra for 2022!</p>\n<h2>Episode 500 of ShopTalk</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2022/01/five-hundred-shoptalks/\">I wrote about ShopTalk’s 500th episode</a> so I won’t go in depth here, but that’s a lot of podcasting over the last ten years. I’ve talked to lots of talented people through this podcast. 500 episodes is a pretty big career milestone and worth celebrating.</p>\n<p>And celebrate I did! After the big recording I got myself a Grape Nerds Slush from Sonic. Special thanks to everyone who has helped make ShopTalk happen and thanks to everyone who has ever tuned in.</p>\n<h2>I built my first Gunpla</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/2022/gunpla.jpg\" alt=\"A small plastic model Gundam robot\" /></p>\n<p>On a whim (remember: buy your happiness) I bought my first entry-grade Gunpla. “Gunpla” (ガンプラ) is a shortened form of the phrase “Gundam Plastic Model” in Japanese. It’s a hobby where you build little anime robots out of pre-colored, press-fit plastic parts. Building a Gunpla model produces an incredibly good, ASMR-like sensation. Way better than western models where you need to prime, paint, and painstakingly glue everything together. Gunpla is more like LEGO where you zen-fully cut out pieces, snap them together, and end up with a fully articulated robot.</p>\n<p>Making my first Gunpla spawned a micro-obsession of learning all about Gunpla; the different grades, the different eras, the different manufacturers, panel lining, fine tip versus pour fill markers, and so on. I’ve learned a lot of useless facts. But it’s also spawned a desire to do more handicrafts.</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://kbdfans.com/products/ic-kbdfans-mountain-ergo-keyboard-kit?variant=39809723039883\">a new ergonomic keyboard</a> to build, a book of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3s4c1Yi\">Frank Lloyd Wright <em>kirigami</em> papercraft models</a>, and of course more Gunpla. I think this new hobby is directly related to logging out of Twitter this month, so I’m going to ride this vibe out and be a bit more analog in my after hours.</p>\n<h2>Another big refactor on Luro</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest months ever behind the scenes on <a href=\"https://luroapp.com/\">Luro</a>. We refactored a bunch of code to make the spinning up installations for new customers a lot easier. This involved removing a MongoDB server and folding our serverless API, node server API, and Nuxt app into a single monolithic Node app. While a “monolith” sounds like a step backwards from a <em>tech de jour</em> it has radically simplified the number of moving parts from 6→3 and better fits our customer goals well.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>— We’re in a much better “it just works” state with <a href=\"http://boringtechnology.club/\">boring technology</a>, it’s a lot easier to run all the parts locally and it’s a lot easier to deploy and a lot easier to get to customers.

      "title": "Five Hundred ShopTalks",
      "summary": "Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.\nIt’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handful of series that capture snapshots of the industry which I find offer up a neat vantage point of “what’s happening now” from tons of different voices. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to gain perspectives outside my own.\nI’m lucky enough to have worked on some cool projects (I once made the Microsoft.com homepage in my spare bedroom), but ShopTalk stands out as a distinct career highlight due to its consistency over time. On a hard drive somewhere I have a graveyard of abandoned side projects, apps, podcasts, and games… yet ShopTalk still stands. We log in every week and do it. Hopefully, getting a smidge better every time. Not all projects need to go 10+ years — and that’s something I still need to learn, it’s okay for them to go away, they can and should change — but it’s rewarding when you’re still having fun doing the thing you started doing so long ago. Fine wine, yadda yadda.\nLessons learned\nThe biggest lesson I’ve learned about podcasting over the last 10 years: it’s all about consistency and quality. Releasing on a consistent day/week/etc (whatever that is for your show) and making sure the show you send to people’s earbuds and cars is a good quality audio file; that means good mic, good edit, decent music and audio cues.\nFor your podcast or (in more contemporary parlance) your livestream focus on finding one easy thing that can boost your quality. I’m a firm believer in the 80:20 rule, there’s often a trick you can do that makes your thing 80% better with 20% of the effort. Often that’s a microphone or learning proper mic technique. Figure it out for your situation, it’s worth it.\nThe other thing Chris and I talk about often is that whenever we’ve needed to make a decision we’ve always sided on making our lives easier and we have no regrets. This allows us to continue to enjoy the podcasting with less stress. For example, I use a USB mic with no audio interface, because easier. We don’t do high concept shows that often, because easier. We don’t typically have more than two guests, because easier. We pay an audio editor, because easier. “Easier” has been a good compass for us.\nLooking forward\nIt’s tough to predict the future of ShopTalk, but it’s more of the same I think. We flamed out a bit on getting guests lined up during the pandemic but I think there’s energy to get back on track. We’ve invested in our “studio” a bit and are using Riverside.fm to make having guests and capturing quality audio even easier.\nThe biggest change going forward is that we’ve branched out into video over on the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel. Be sure to smash that like button and subscribe. We’ve made ~24 episodes since September which isn’t too shabby for a buncha dads.\nThe final thing is the ShopTalk D-D-D-Discord. We’ve pivoted a smidge from being a broadcast-only podcast to being more of an active community. Lots of friendly folks in there now and because it’s a global chatroom so there’s messages and activity happening from when I wake up to when I go to bed. That’s exciting. There’s a lot more we could be doing (weekly hangouts or whatever) and hope to explore that more going forward.\nAnd lastly,\nThanks to all the people we’ve brought on board to help with the show. First was Aaron Dowd editing, then Chris Enns took over at the audio editor helm, the folks at BuySellAds helping sell ads, Tina Pham at Pham Transcription Services, Miranda Mulligan for helping us with the books, Chris Taylor for the theme songs, the D-D-D-Discord for inspiration, WordPress devs and plugin authors who have helped work on the site, and countless guests who have let us pick their brains over the years. Thanks to everyone who has helped out.\nThank you, dear listener, for downloading ShopTalk in your podcatcher of choice. It means a lot to me that you’d take the time to listen, even once. Thank you. Shopomaniacs 4 lyfe.\nAnd finally, thanks to Chris Coyier, my partner in podcast crimes. It’s been a blast.\n“Just. Build. Websites.”",

      "content_text": "Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.\nIt’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handful of series that capture snapshots of the industry which I find offer up a neat vantage point of “what’s happening now” from tons of different voices. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to gain perspectives outside my own.\nI’m lucky enough to have worked on some cool projects (I once made the Microsoft.com homepage in my spare bedroom), but ShopTalk stands out as a distinct career highlight due to its consistency over time. On a hard drive somewhere I have a graveyard of abandoned side projects, apps, podcasts, and games… yet ShopTalk still stands. We log in every week and do it. Hopefully, getting a smidge better every time. Not all projects need to go 10+ years — and that’s something I still need to learn, it’s okay for them to go away, they can and should change — but it’s rewarding when you’re still having fun doing the thing you started doing so long ago.

      "title": "HTML is general, ARIA is specific",
      "summary": "In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed <popupdialog> element should have, if any…\nThe proposed <popupdialog> element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a <div> or a <span> but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?\nAll good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.\nWhat struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.\nHTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. <div>? Sure, that can be a div. <article>? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. <video>? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing.

It’s been a year. Ups and downs. A big change for me and for this blog was that I documented it all in my monthly Vibe Checks. That was successful and enjoyable so I plan on continuing those. They’re great to look back on and for rounding up miscellaneous thoughts.\nGetting diagnosed with skin cancer and having it removed with Mohs surgery was a big emotional part of the year. I describe it as “ambient stress”, a whiny noise in the background that you try not to pay attention but is affecting your mood.

A lot of the books and facts in similar genres started repeating themselves. I may have exhausted some of the self-help and popular science genres, it’s all rehashed Malcom Gladwell at some point. Losing steam, I paused on audiobooks and plowed thru podcast arcs instead. Those are fun and immersive. I think next year I’m going to try more paper books and sci-fi.\nMedia-wise, I broke up with Twitter and deleted it from my phone and iPad. Had a fling with TikTok but that too felt like wasting time. Now my phone is boring. I spent a good amount of time clearing out RSS and podcatcher feeds were my mainstays towards the end of the year.\nWork and health\nI worked on some cool projects this year like a Covid response dashboard for the CDC of Africa, I got to collab with the fine folks at Happy Cog which felt like a childhood dream come true, and I even made progress on building a product with Paravel — but I’m exhausted. Professionally fulfilled, but exhausted. Can’t remember a single “slow” week. This sounds dour, but it’s sort of how it works out running and starting your own company. I’m slightly worried about my stamina/burnout going forward, but I’ll keep my hands on the plow and my eyes on the prize.\nI’m realizing my health and work impact eachother. I did do some Apple Fitness, I started playing Pickleball, resumed my daily one-mile school drop-off walks; some progress, but it wasn’t enough to stave off back pains, etc. I think to be more effective at work (or even household chores) I need to make fitness a priority.

This book outlines some of the structural problems in regards to wealth generation in our capitalistic democracy.\nProject Hail Mary - Science’ing shit in space. Another wonderful page-turner book by Andy Weir.\n\n\n📝 Blogging - I wrote a lot but published little.\n\nSustaining Maintaining - a thinkpiece about how there’s little education in open source beyond setting up repos and installing CI/CD; without education everyone learns the hard way, leading to burnout.\nFive good feelings - a short dissertation about books\n\n\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes\n\nShop Talk is inching closer to Episode 500\nI took part in the Frontend Horse Holiday Snowtacular where we raised money for TeamSeas to remove over 5 tons of trash from the ocean. I talked about blogs. Brief but fun.\nYouTubes - After a month break due to surgery and general busy-ness, ShopTalk managed to cut two episodes.\n\nAstro - 20 minutes of playing with Astro, I used a VTuber skin because my nose was still fucked up.\nPlay video onscroll - Intersection Observers and the HTML Media Element API, sorta my wheelhouse.\n\n\nListened\n\nRabbit Hole - a NYT investigation into algorithmic radicalization (YouTube, Facebook, etc). A must listen, IMO.\n\n\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Not successful\n",

      "summary": "You see it all the time; a repo with a thousand issues, a hundred open PRs, a thousand forks. v2.0 is on the way but there’s no clear roadmap or communication. Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, and the endless “this doesn’t work and you’re a bad human” support requests.\nThe critical issue for me was that open source was counter-cyclical to my life. I’d open source in slow times, but couldn’t manage client work and open source work in busy times. Out of principle we don’t work on weekends at Paravel… but people on GitHub sure do! Every Monday morning my inbox would be full of crushing guilt and neglected responsibility as issues piled up on my projects.\nFor every issue closed, three new issues showed up. I love open source, but it felt endless and unmanageable. As burnout encroached, I went into self-preservation mode. I did a bit here and there, but sought refuge for my mental health in video games and comic books instead of working nights and weekends. Years went by and having children deleted any concept of spare time.\nIt would be great if I had more time! But time requires money. Sentry and GitHub hosted a panel this week called “The Future of Open Source: Is It Sustainable?” which was a candid discussion about funding. There’s different shapes funding can take, but most open source funding happens through either a dedicated employer, support contracts, a crowdfunding tip jar, or a foundation; the unifying factor seems to be maintainers get paid. Money helps make open source sustainable.\nBut financials are one part of the sustainable open source equation. There’s an emotional cost to having a publicly available project that hundreds or thousands of people and companies depend on as well. One of the best talks I’ve heard on open source maintenance and one I reference often is Jacob Thornton’s 2012 dotJS talk “What Is Open Source & Why Do I Feel So Guilty?”\n\nFrom the old Xerox PARC days to the open sourcing of Netscape in 1998 (which was the first use of the term “open source”) to the modern day npm install whatever-i-want; open source has come a long way. In ye olde times, we downloaded shareware from Sourceforge which was an effective way to install malware on your computer. GitHub’s launch in 2008 fundamentally changed how we build, share, and distribute software. It has even turned a proprietary titan like Microsoft into an open source advocate. The internet relies on people working for free.\nTowards the end of the talk, Thornton gets to the heart of the issue:\n\nWith the acceleration of GitHub making everything more efficient, making everything easier and easier, the time to burnout is accelerating at a break neck pace.\n\n“Burnout”. There’s the word.\nI sometimes wonder why a company like GitHub doesn’t offer educational, financial, or organizational support to maintainers. There’s plenty of write-ups on GitHub about how to start a new open source project, or how to add tooling, but almost no information or best practices on how to maintain a project over years. I think there’s a big education gap and opportunity here. GitHub has an obvious incentive to increase num_developers and num_repos,  but I think it’s worthwhile to ease the burden of existing developers and increase the quality and security of existing repos. Open source maintenance needs a manual.\nIf I were to spitball some chapter titles or sections for a manual, it’d look like this:\n\nDifferentiating between support requests and Issues\nIssue management (issue templates, labels, sticky issues, closing strategies)\nHow to handle volume without losing your soul\nLanding pull requests from strangers (security concerns, etc)\nSetting up testing and continuous integration\nHow to get Sponsors\nHow and why to use Discussions\nHow and why to use Projects and Milestones\nHow to write good documentation\nSetting boundaries and office hours\nEffective and clear communication\nChoosing an open source business model\n\nOr what about offering in-person support? Developer Advocates could offer this list of services to project maintainers in exchange for livestream or video content. I’d love to see more content where existing projects get help on tooling or process instead of always starting from a blank repo. Call it “Pimp My Repo”, get Xzibit to host, sell it to MTV. I’d watch it. I’d also watch interviews with successful maintainers to learn about their maintenance routines. It’d be beneficial to the open source community as a whole to replace the starving artist —slash— burnt out maintainer trope with chilled out maintainers who have a good work/life balance.\nI think there’s also a lot of opportunity for lessons in Open Source Citizenship education as well. Instead of endless “Fuck you, fix my project” requests, there’s some hoops to jump through, some education, some reminder that there’s humans working for free on the other side of that comment box. CONTRIBUTING.md is a good step but contrast that with something like Discord’s welcome screen feature where you have to read and agree with a code of conduct before you can contribute. Anything to curb the entitlement and abuse is welcome. Onboarding people to the proper etiquette for filing a good bug report with proper repro steps or a reduced test case would go miles.\nThere’s also another idea out there: a “Pay to Engage” model. You can read all the code, all the commits, all the issues, all the discussions, fork it, clone it, but if you want to engage and ask for help, you need to pay. Pay to Engage isn’t for every project and could hinder some projects, but it could unlock some sustainability.\nThese are ideas, I probably have a million more. And you probably have a million as well. I’d love to read your blog posts about it. If you maintain an open source project, what’s been successful for you on the marathon? What’s worked? What hasn’t?

The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.\nEarlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outage. The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an undefined function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.\nSpeaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret. It’s called Luro and we think you’ll love it. Before we open the doors, we need to let it bake a bit more with our first cohort of beta testing customers. Then we’ll have more to talk about and show.\nOther vibes\nI spent a lot of mental energy learning and establishing my thoughts about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs this month. Some of that thinking leaked out on Shop Talk Show #490. I think I’m out for now. There’s a lot to say. Solving ledger-like problems seems okay. DAOs are (probably unenforcable, but) interesting. But truly, nothing compelling other than FOMO right now. Money charts going up is cool and produces a great amount of envy, but I read a lot, listened to a lot of podcasts, challenged myself to be open-minded and not old man yells at cloud, yet … I can’t. And that’s where I’m at on that, for now at least.\nAll the Web3 hype (as well as Politics Twitter) actually made me uninstall Twitter from my iPad and iPhone… and I kind of love it. I’m unplugged from the outrage machine and it’s much quieter. Stomping the urge to reinstall the app or log in from Mobile Safari for some dumb tweet is the hardest part, but I’m so far successful.\nWith time to kill, I spent a lot of time watching TikToks and roleplaying videos, both popular DnD5E series (like Critical Role (Campaign 3), Battle for Beyond, The Adventure Zone: Imbalance) and for one-shots systems like Lasers and Feelings. I’m enchanted by the idea of running a one-shot and may try to put one together in one of my Discords. But for now I’ll live vicariously through watching videos and pretend I’m pretending… wait.\nI’m even starting to think about making a video game again…\nStats\n\n📖 Reading: Opted for podcasts over audiobooks this month, but still managed to squeeze in three books.\n\nThe Bomber Mafia - Continuing my quest to read all the Malcom Gladwell novels. This book was a bit dull, but the theme around “Is there an ethical way to bomb during war?” and the exploration of that theme was interesting enough to sustain me.\nThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team - A business classic! An interesting look at how different personalities and attitudes can impact a team.\nEffortless - Another good, thought-provoking book by Greg McKeown. “How do you not feel overwhelmed even when you become an essentialist?” McKeown shares some strategies for creating “effortless” work. Not 100% practical, but challenging at least.\n\n\n📝 Blogging: Did not ride the blogging train into November as I hoped, but it’s fine, I watched TikToks instead.\n\nGaming improved my EQ\nStatus Performance Analysis in Team Fortress 2\n\n\n💪 Fitness: Mild setback as I may have injured a butt cheek swinging a pickaxe while clearing the nandina out of the side yard with my neighbor.\n🎙 Podcasts and YouTubes: Released a normal amount of podcasts.

Incredible editing and incredible guests. It covers a lot of burgeoning design/UX concerns and constantly asks “How can we do X better?”\nWolverine: The Lost Trail (Season 2) - Logan runs from Weapon X, blah blah, not as good as the first season, but entertaining and I love the old-timey serial radio show vibe.\n\n\n\n\n⌨️ Open Source: Reviewed a PRs for <spicy-sections>\n⚖️ Budgeting: Actually started looking at this today.

      "content_text": "On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.\nEarlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outage. The target server wiped a setting which produced a silent failure and the Github Action thought the backend API deployment succeeded… but, dear reader, it did not deploy… since like August. I also found an undefined function crashing a monthly chron job. Lord, Lord, this took a long time to untangle. After a lot of staring at the console, I diagnosed the issues, landed fixes, and added some much needed monitoring and documentation that will hopefully make it easier next time around.\nSpeaking of the app I’m working on, it’s now a little less of a secret. It’s called Luro and we think you’ll love it. Before we open the doors, we need to let it bake a bit more with our first cohort of beta testing customers. Then we’ll have more to talk about and show.\nOther vibes\nI spent a lot of mental energy learning and establishing my thoughts about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs this month.

I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.\nTaking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back.

When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.\nCooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage. There’s not one uniform metric for success, if you measure solely on damage dealt that skews the reality of how success happens.\nBringing this full circle, even your worst performing player — who it would be easy to throw under the bus — might be adding immeasurable value…\nA message to the worst one on the team... pic.twitter.com/pJIuaTE5Mc— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) January 13, 2021 \nAdding value as “the anchor”.

It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:\n\nnerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality\nbuff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality\nsalty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.\ntoxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.\ntilted - angered to a point where it’s negatively effecting your personal performance.\nmeta - what’s popular, typically a character or weapon that is has a high pick rate and/or offers some competitive advantage.\nmeta shift - when the existing meta changes due to nerfs, buffs, or newly discovered techniques.\nmental - your state of mind, mental game, e.g. “protect your mental”.\nchalked - dead, done for, broken, not worth pursuing.\nblender - a series of repeating failures, e.g. “I’m in a blender”\ngame sense - your understanding of the map or environment, positioning, enemy assessment, and win conditions\npsychic damage - long lasting damage effects that last multiple rounds (this one is from D&D)\n\nThrough gaming, I’m attuned to what it feels like to be tilted. I’m know when upset — a hijacking of my amygdala — and I know that makes me play bad and then I’m more upset and I play worse… a classic negative feedback loop. Squadmates can sense this in each other too and can try to help each other reset (or call each other out), but sometimes turning off the computer is the best course of action.\nTaking that into my daily life, knowing when I’m tilted —whether it be by some meeting, a global pandemic, or a child whittling on your last nerve— I know that feeling. Because of gaming, I know when I need to reset, I know how to reset (read, sleep), and I find myself having an easier time stepping back. I know when I have an unnecessary, salty, bitchy attitude about some predicament. I can almost taste it. Acknowledging when I’m in a blender helps let the psychic damage roll over me, like diving under a crashing wave. Get through it, it’ll turn around.\nThe concept of meta shifts is interesting too. When a meta shifts in a video game it can be  frustrating that your old tricks and characters don’t work anymore. It’s feels like you lost all game sense and your controller no longer works. Extrapolating that to meta shifts in technology has given verbiage to something I felt in my work life but couldn’t articulate. That feeling when the tools I use and the technology I’ve invested in are no longer cool any more, or even talked down upon. When the meta shifts on you, you feel irreparably behind the curve and you’re crushed with the feeling you need to re-learn everything to level up your skills on the new meta. It’s exhausting, leads to burnout, and you want to uninstall yourself from tech; but I think there’s power in understanding you’re in a meta shift.\nCooperative games (video, tabletop, etc) also give you an understanding that each person in an organization has a role to play. A lot of games you select a character class and you learn that how you measure performance looks different. A DPS (damage per second) player should deal damage, a tank player should take damage, and a support player should remove damage. There’s not one uniform metric for success, if you measure solely on damage dealt that skews the reality of how success happens.\nBringing this full circle, even your worst performing player — who it would be easy to throw under the bus — might be adding immeasurable value…\nA message to the worst one on the team... pic.twitter.com/pJIuaTE5Mc— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) January 13, 2021 \nAdding value as “the anchor”. That’s some EQ for ya.",

      "summary": "Frustrated by the emotional weight of hundreds of thoughts lingering in my blogging kanban, I chucked a good bit of time into a week of high-powered blogging and achieved great results. Garnered eight blog posts this month and a one week streak. One of the best months of blogging I’ve had in a good while.\nI needed to flush ideas out so that I could start to focus on other more interesting ideas. With those out of the way, I can make room for other thoughts or what I secretly want to do: write shitty science fiction. Between blog posts, YouTubes, and podcasts; this month it felt like the Dave Rupert Content Engine™ was working.\nI hoped to post a bit more in Blogtober, but my family’s plans changed a bit as my wife’s grandmother passed away. What balance I was thriving on was shaken up by a death in the family. I still have half-a-dozen posts on deck, so I’m optimistic momentum can continue into November as I purge ideas out of the queue.\nGoodbye Grandma Jeanne\nMy wife’s grandma Jeanne was a wonderful woman who lived in-and-around Bakersfield, California her whole life. She had a full 89 years of life and after a rough summer of mystery health problems this summer culminating in a stroke and a case of pneumonia, she moved on from this world. She will be deeply missed.\nShe was a sharp and clever woman; a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend. Dedicated to her church and would never miss a chance to let you know she’s praying for you. She leaves behind her a great legacy and some lucky ones have inherited her singing voice.\nI never knew my great grandparents, so I think it’s special that my kids will at least have some memory of Great Grandma Jeanne. It’s a good thing when families can span generations and dinners with “cousins” occupy a whole wing of a restaurant.\nThe case of the ill-fitting jacket\nWhile trying on jackets for the funeral, I found an almost perfect jacket at J. Crew. Disappointment set in as it felt the smallest bit short when I tried it on. The dressing room associate pointed out the jacket was actually normal but because my distended belly was so fat, the jacket was pulling up. He might have said it nicer, but not much nicer.\nThat… uh… wasn’t a great feeling. But I did learn that in a 2020s world where everything is slim fits, I’m a 1990s-sized regular. Only husky 90s kids get this.\nThus… I guess November is Health Month. I’m already taking steps but the bulk of my issues come down to prioritizing myself. Will need to focus on that, but it’s hard with wife and kids and whatnot. If you’re good at prioritizing yourself — awesome — I literally don’t want to hear a fucking word from you. If you’re bad at it, oh nice, me too, I’d love to commiserate.\nAutumnal Camping\nIn the middle of the month my family and I went camping with our camping friends. Our campsite backed up to Lake Georgetown about 30 minutes north of Austin. It felt like a great escape without hauling a trailer for hours there and back.\nWe are reaping the rewards of camping with the same people over many years. We know how to plan, divvy, and cook meals for twenty people out of coolers and camp stoves. We know what gear and gadgets we need and don’t need. We prattle on about careers, life, kids, maladies, and faith as you can only do around a campfire. Our kids are all growing up too. We used to have to helicopter around them all weekend, but now they move in tiny flocks together from campsite to campsite and holler if they take a serious tumble or find something like a tarantula! Exciting.\nStarting to think about updating our camper but might be cheaper to buy land somewhere 😂\nBusiness-wise\nBusiness-wise things are progressing. Demos are happening. Contracts are being inked.\nStats-based Vibe Gamification\n\n📖 Reading: Finished three books and one graphic novel.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It - The story of Donald Trump’s last year in office. It’s incredibly sad how much of our 2020 coronavirus response was based around appeasing the whims and re-election of one individual.\nThe Manager’s Path - Excellent book! I loved how Camille Fournier went into detail about job titles and roles, drawing a line in the sand for different responsibilities. Throughout the book there’s a sentiment that a manager’s job is to get people promoted.\nArtemis - Andy Weir knows how to write action. This is the fastest I’ve ever read a book. From page one you’re blasting off on a non-stop thriller.\nMonumental - The story of Oscar Dunn, Louisiana’s first black Lt. Governer during post-Civil War Reconstruction. This is a story I hadn’t heard and needs to be retold more often. The problems then mirror our problems today.

I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don’t know. And it doesn’t matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.\nOh, but they’ll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying “But remember that time…”\nI don’t get it. I don’t see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn’t a beef holder either. She’s one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.",

Here is the retelling of vibes…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/baseball.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kids playing baseball under a stormy night sky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The little league championship 🏆&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my last vibe check I mentioned my son’s little league experience and how he and his teammates talked about the playoffs, but I wasn’t sure if they existed or not. Well… the playoffs were real! A single elimination playoff bracket. Eight teams enter, one team leaves…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Otis’s team, the Athletics, squeaked their way through to the finals and ended up winning the Northwest Little League championship. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A happy, unexpected end to our first full season of baseball. Seeing the growth of every kid on every team over the course of a season was a treat. At the beginning of the season no one can pitch and it’s a walk-a-thon, but then the pitchers start throwing strikes, then the kids realize they can’t stand there and need to start hitting, then the kids realize they need to start fielding the ball, then they start making plays and forcing outs. It’s a how-to play baseball montage that happens over eight weeks. The coaches did a phenomenal job and fostered a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The road to productivity hell is paved with context switching&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In mid-April my wife got a job at the kids’ elementary school. It’s awesome and I think the job suits her unique skills; namely she can remember everyone’s name. One side effect of this lifestyle change is we destroyed the balance of household duties we’ve established over the last ~8 years since having kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We expected the change but a lot of May was about adjusting to this new balance. A day went like this: Wake up make breakfasts and lunch → Get the kids off to school → Work for an hour or two → Interrupt my morning flow with a meeting → Work a bit and get lunch → Sit down at my desk for an hour → Get the kids from school → Get the kids to swim → The kids ask me for snacks until their mom gets home → Try to get another hour of work done…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Darn near impossible to establish any sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/391pRW5&quot;&gt;deep work&lt;/a&gt; rhythm with that schedule. As a result I’m not sure I was as productive as I hoped to be last month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The family context switching was extra, but even work had a considerable bit of context switching. A lot of switching back and forth between backend work → frontend work but also switching from building the product → building the business → building the engineering team. In a day I might cycle between product dev work → documentation → testing → meetings → podcasts → research → learning → side projects → open source. Each of those contexts have a Brain RAM cost. Mix in my (undiagnosed) ADHD and what a wonderful tapestry of distraction and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For some reason I thought this would be a good month to try live streaming some side project work on Twitch. After three streams I think my streaming career is kaput. In a different multiverse where I have no kids, I’m not starting a company, or if my work duties radically change… it could potentially work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;tl;dr&lt;/em&gt; here is I need to eliminate some extra contexts from my life. That hurts my heart but &lt;a href=&quot;http://sophieshepherd.com/2017/06/14/learning-to-be-chill.html&quot;&gt;the road to burnout is paved with context switching&lt;/a&gt; and we don’t want that. My new goal in life —after getting a breakfast platter named after me— is to be so bored I have time to read a magazine subscription.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;New hires and new features&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An exciting month at the job. We managed to hire two talented folks who are going to help us build the future of Luro. One person is already onboarded and one arrives next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hiring people is a lot of work. Who knew. All worth it, of course. First off, as a business, you need to know how you’re going to assess the skills and “fit” of a person. In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3NreF3N&quot;&gt;Good to Great&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Jim Collins calls this “getting the right people on the bus”, but ethically you also want to do that in a way that’s as fair and unbiased as possible. To me, this means establishing a standard interview template (with some flexibility) and devising a grading system. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homerun.co/guides/job-interviewing&quot;&gt;complete guide to job interviewing&lt;/a&gt; was helpful but you need to mix in some engineering specifics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then you need to comb backlogs, perform mini-explorations of near-future features, speculate far off features; all to figure out your exact skill gaps and what types of roles might fill those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then you need to determine if a job candidate’s skills match those gaps. This is hard for me, because I optimistically believe everyone has potential to figure out everything, but in startup land, that time and runway is somewhat precious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then, if you make a hire, before they show up you have to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure all your documentation is up-to-snuff&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure the local dev environment stands up in minutes and not days&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create some &lt;code&gt;Good First Issue&lt;/code&gt; tickets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Devise some low- to high-challenge tasks for ramping up, hopefully providing exposure to critical parts of the application&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish clear and concrete goals and objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve also decided that for every new hire I’m going make sure all module dependencies and Node versions are as updated as possible, so those problems don’t create a bad first install experience. Thinking about the “user experience” of employee onboarding is possibly overkill but it’s something I’d like to do well if possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a couple weeks everyone will be fully onboarded and back from vacation. I’m excited to see the lights turn on in the engineering department. In fact, with the help of our newest hire we were able to build out a new feature that we think is going to make a big impact and become a centerpiece to the application. Good vibes all around. It feels like the rocket ship is about to take off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Uvalde&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to reflect on May without acknowledging the horrible, preventable tragedy that occurred at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX. Kids my own son’s age. Mass shootings are shockingly not uncommon in America, but having an insincere state government that blusters and passes laws to make the situation worse while kids are dying en masse is heartbreaking. My heart goes out to all the families dealing with the unimaginable pain, loss, and grief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Texans, please register and vote accordingly this fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Core Dave Vitals&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What you stat nerds all come here for….&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; - All my reading notes are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/bookshelf&quot;&gt;my bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3LWGiAS&quot;&gt;What a Body Can Do?&lt;/a&gt; by Sara Hendren [🌟 Staff pick]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B004P1JDJO.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Pink&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3liF1IE&quot;&gt;The First 90 Days&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Watkins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3M1Aohl&quot;&gt;The Rema Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Kim Kibushi&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - Educational resources\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-components/&quot;&gt;Frontend Masters Web Components&lt;/a&gt; - My Frontend Masters course on web components is now LIVE!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://masteringnuxt.com/&quot;&gt;Mastering Nuxt&lt;/a&gt; - I use Nuxt everyday, but working through this course to round out my knowledge and shore up my understanding of the idioms of Nuxt/Vue, rather than solely relying on my current on-demand learning approach.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🧶 &lt;strong&gt;Crafting&lt;/strong&gt; - No crafts.

And then if I’m honest there’s a fourth and fifth variety: e-waste and a bag of old clothes and toys to donate. The big three live outside in the side yard and those last two live in piles in my garage until I can’t handle looking at them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The side yard has three enormous trash bins. The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem. Our recycling… well, our recycling is always full and overflowing. You see, we’re &lt;strong&gt;bottlenecked&lt;/strong&gt; by the city’s two week pick up cycle. When the bin fills up we create &lt;strong&gt;staging areas&lt;/strong&gt; with paper bags to triage the excess recycling. The minute the city hauls off the previous load, we’ve filled up half of our capacity on our next two week cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s piles of recycling TODOs all over my house, not in a hoarder way, but in a shabby chic, mid-century modern meets the reality of a pandemic way. French country. Chip n’ Jo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The big issue is our recycle bin is DDoS’d by cardboard from Amazon. All those great ideas that came with boxes inside boxes. The swells of orders at birthdays and holidays. Those gifts become a hazard. Boxes on top of boxes because if you prematurely optimize and flatten them they get more slippery and you fall on them. It creates pressure and stress on the in-home recycling operation. Time and mental energy spent on sorting, squashing, grouping, cutting, and planning what can go out in the next week’s load.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hear I can &lt;strong&gt;add capacity&lt;/strong&gt; by calling the city and requesting a second recycling bin. That seems like a lot to always have a fourth enormous trashcan sitting around. I don’t need that much capacity. Or do I?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The city allows me to &lt;strong&gt;bundle&lt;/strong&gt; my boxes as a strategy. If I cut up all the boxes into 2ft×2ft flat pieces and tie that up, I can set that next to the recycling and the city will pick it up. It’s a lot of work to prepare that and any threat of rain will leave you with a soggy mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can &lt;strong&gt;add temporary capacity&lt;/strong&gt; from gracious neighbors. I’d use their garbage cans and pay them back with confections, hoping I don’t burn through the goodwill. This is probably the simplest solution, but also a lot of work for trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, there’s a rumor going around that none of the recycling ever gets recycled. They say it goes to the landfill because China quit buying our trash. I hate it, but kind of believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 14:13:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/05/the-recycling-backlog/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/05/the-recycling-backlog/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Doge'd a bullet</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/rss-club/&quot;&gt;Read more about RSS Club&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” = yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” = yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” = yes, even cooler. “DAOs let communities have ownership in the projects they like” = yes, in theory&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. At its core, even the basic idea of a sci-fi reality where we &lt;em&gt;zlorp&lt;/em&gt; our space credits to each other on our holo-visors seems like a probable eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From Easter 2020 to Easter 2021 I watched in my Stocks app as the price of $ETH went from $180 to $2230 (+1,288%)  and $SOL went from $0.60 to $31.70 (+5,221%). Dang. Regret. I should have bought. But two weeks later I watched as both of those coins lost 50% of their value overnight. Phew. Vindication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The price of course rebounded and climbed 10× around November 2021. Dang. Regret. This was the peak NFT era, it seemed crypto was approaching a critical mass. Actual smart people I knew were holding crypto. Actual smart people I know were leaving their FAANG jobs to join Web3 projects. Every conversation I had ended up talking about crypto. The FOMO was building.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I somehow convinced myself that I needed to go in and go in big. If my $500 turned into $600 or even $1000, that doesn’t materially change my life that much. It’s not “Buy a boat” money. It had to be a large number. So I started pooling together about $10,000 to spread over a handful of coins that I thought had a strategic advantage:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$ETH - smart contracts are pretty smart&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$SOL - a greener alternative to $ETH&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$LUNA - backed by a “stablecoin” and that sounded nice&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$DOGE - for the memes but it goes up every time Elon tweets about it and you can buy a lot of it for cheap&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the pace crypto was going I was confident I could double my money over the course of a couple months. I needed to pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After gut-checking with friends (who were like “Sure, man”), my wife (who to this day says, “I don’t get it”), my financial advisor (who was like 😬), and &lt;em&gt;doing my own research&lt;/em&gt;… I decided not to pull the trigger. The lack of consumer protections, the surface area for criminal activity (scams, theft, laundering, wash trading), the way your cash-on-hand is also your investment portfolio, the fake scarcity, the rich getting richer, the low-quality art in the form of monkey JPGs selling at inflated prices, gas fees, and the carbon costs… those all bothered me immensely. Ultimately I felt like crypto was a 2010 solution (electricity is free!) that didn’t fit 2021 problems (we are soon approaching the 1.5ºC thresh hold!).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of investing actual money, I installed a Stock Market Simulator on my iPad and played pretend crypto. If my imaginary numbers went up, I could revisit the idea. But over the course of a couple months, I watched the numbers turn redder and redder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/stonks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Solana chart showing an 82% drop in value from $230 USD to $40 USD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As of writing this: $ETH is down 58%, $SOL is down 82%, $LUNA has lost 99.97% of its value. I’m not some genius investor that shorted the entire crypto market and made millions, but I keep thinking about how I dodged a bullet and saved about $8000 by &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; investing in crypto. Phew. Vindication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s all relative. If I had bought two years ago, I’d still be up a bit. A lotta bit actually. But back then I would have invested something small like $500. Still, my $500 of imaginary $SOL would be worth $44,000. Dang. Regret. That’s incredible, yet all feels so made up. It’s like how Uber is a taxi company with no cars, crypto is an economy with no tangible goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I could still end up with egg on my face here. The minute the market drops 10~20% and I feel vindicated about my decision to hold off, some pump’n’dump happens to spike the price up +20%. And for some reason my lizard brain still says “Dang. Regret.” Weird how that works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways. I reserve the right to change my mind at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;DAOs we’re almost &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; selling point for me on crypto, but I now sort of feel like most DAOs reinforce oligarchies rather than enable democracies. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 15:06:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/05/doge-d-a-bullet/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/05/doge-d-a-bullet/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Thoughts on spectrums</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/the-gray-gray-ghost-that-i-call-home/&quot;&gt;a grey area&lt;/a&gt; in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/roygbiv.png&quot; alt=&quot;a ROYGBIV spectrum&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel, an infinitely wrapping spectrum of rainbow colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/color-wheel.png&quot; alt=&quot;A rainbow color wheel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A beautiful rainbow circle, I hope my computer is okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then… we learn about saturation. Colors can be vibrant and saturated or duller and unsaturated shades. You can tune color wheels to provide this effect, but for the best representation of color saturation, we need another axis as if color exists on an XY chart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/color-picker.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Windows XP color picker with &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus color pickers! The horizontal X-axis reflects the hue across the ROYGBIV spectrum and the vertical Y-axis reflects the saturation. Adding another dimension helps explain color and saturation in a single image. Two axes are better than one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But look! On this particular color picker there’s a slider to control another aspect of color: lightness, a way to tint a color lighter and darker. This hints that our XY plot isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is where math and algorithmic representations of colors and lightwaves start coming into play. On the web, we can express over 16 million colors using a mix of &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;blue&lt;/em&gt; pixels or expressing a color in an alternate method of combining &lt;em&gt;hue&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;saturation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lightness&lt;/em&gt;; each three properties, three dimensions of differentiation. We actually need three axes to visualize our color possibilities which we can do in a three dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot; style=&quot;display: grid; gap: var(--gap, 1.5rem); grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/rgb.png&quot; alt=&quot;A cube with red, green, and blue, on the X, Y, and Z axis&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/hsl.png&quot; alt=&quot;An extruded cylindrical colorwheel with colors fading to white as it gets taller. A cross-section is also cut out of the cylinder.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RGB color space looks like a gay Rubik’s cube and the HSL color space looks like a birthday cake drenched in icing. Each color-space (RGB, HSL, CMYK, Lab, etc) has its own different space of representable colors! The algorithm for each color-space gives us a different perspective. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huevaluechroma.com/001.php&quot;&gt;David Briggs has a collection of renderings of color spaces next to each other&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/color-spaces.png&quot; alt=&quot;3D models for RGB, CMY, HLS, HSB, YCbCr, and Lab color spaces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The shape of the color space is somewhat dependent on the math and algorithmic shorthand used by the color profile to derive the colors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2015/04/03/displaying-a-color-gamut-surface/&quot;&gt;Steve Eddins generated a beautiful rendering of a rotation of the Lab color-space&lt;/a&gt; and it’s one of my favorite renderings I’ve come across.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;slide-show controls=&quot;pagination&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/lab-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lab color space rotated 0º showing an irregular shaped rock-like object that is showing all the colors of a rainbow in different lightnesses&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/lab-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lab color space rotated 120º presenting more purple and pink hues&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/spectrum/lab-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lab color space rotated 240º presenting more auburn and green hues&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/slide-show&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s more color spaces to explore! I found an old app for Windows called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/tour_gamutvision.html#displaytable&quot;&gt;Gamutvision&lt;/a&gt; that tries to visualize these color spaces. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS1OHMW873s&quot;&gt;John Austin explains the mathematical history of color spaces&lt;/a&gt;. Craig Hockenberry —&lt;a href=&quot;https://abookapart.com/products/making-sense-of-color-management&quot;&gt;who wrote a book on color&lt;/a&gt;—  wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.iconfactory.com/2016/04/looking-at-the-future/&quot;&gt;Apple’s new wide-gamut displays&lt;/a&gt; and links to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astramael.com/&quot;&gt;an even more in-depth look at color gamuts on Mac&lt;/a&gt;. There’s newer and wider gamuts on the horizon too, colors we’ve never seen on the screen before!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People see color differently. Not just that they bought a nice TV or phone with a wider-gamut and more accurate algorithm, but also due to a variety of cultural or physiological differences as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gMqZR3pqMjg&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Japan they call the color of their verdant bamboo mountains, leafy green vegetables, green apples, and the color of the “go” signal on a traffic light; 青 (blue). I learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_PBehkjoJI&quot;&gt;the history of this&lt;/a&gt; in college, but it always caught me by surprise an entire nation could be so collectively wrong… or was I the one who was wrong in that particular cultural setting?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Personal perspective factors in too, even factoring out colorblindness. My wife calls the international walk signal pictogram “the blue walking man” and while it does have a blue-ish tint, I guffaw because it’s clearly white. And don’t get me started about the color of a tennis ball; she insists it’s “fluorescent green” and I recognize it as the color “fluorescent yellow” —as in “&lt;em&gt;optic yellow&lt;/em&gt;”, the literal color name for a tennis ball— but it’s hard to say who’s right. We’re not alone in our disagreement and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tennis_ball&amp;amp;offset=&amp;amp;limit=500&amp;amp;action=history&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page for tennis ball&lt;/a&gt; is now locked after hundreds of edit wars over dozens of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So that’s color. It can be a spectrum and you wouldn’t be wrong, but the possibilities of color are more accurately modeled in a multi-dimensional space. I’m not anti-spectrum, they’re an improvement over binaries, but they rarely sum up the entire issue at hand. Factor in your culture’s understanding of color or your personal understanding of color via the rods and cones in your eyeballs… color is both extremely objective and extremely subjective. And on a computer, the hardware algorithm that is showing you the colors might also limit your perception of color.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, those are my thoughts on spectrums. I feel you can apply multi-dimensional thinking to a lot of ideas: good vs. evil, gender, politics, disabilities, technology choices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/06/log-jams/&quot;&gt;kanbans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXD8YQ7j_Qk&quot;&gt;video game character balance&lt;/a&gt;, and the list goes on. Your mileage may vary, but I think there’s one thing we can all agree on; most dichotomies are false. 😉&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 13:14:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/05/spectrums/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/05/spectrums/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Notes from a gopher:// site</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Long time readers of the blog will know I’m a fan of esoteric content delivery protocols. While compulsively checking for updates on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.date/&quot;&gt;Playdate&lt;/a&gt; (a small, yellow, Gameboy-like device with a crank) and I came across this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When Playdate shipped, Panic co-founder Steven wrote a little about what it meant to him. And in the spirit of doing things differently, posted it to a Gopher (!) site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re up for it, find it here:  gopher://stevenf.com:70/0/journal/2022/04/18/first-playdates-shipping.txt&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Playdate (@playdate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1520144706511904768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 29, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;gopher://&lt;/code&gt; site in the year 2022!? Minutes prior I was reading a Polygon piece about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/23013686/playdate-panic-crank-history&quot;&gt;Playdate’s 8-year process behind the crank&lt;/a&gt; and I needed more Playdate development stories. Now I find out the co-founder of Panic has a non-&lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; gopher site where he blogs about Playdate development? How cool. I couldn’t resist, but first I needed a &lt;code&gt;gopher&lt;/code&gt; client.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;xvxx/code/fetch\nphetch gopher://stevenf.com:70/0/journal/2022/04/18/first-playdates-shipping.txt\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevenf.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Frank&lt;/a&gt;’s article appeared in my command line terminal. In the post Steven illuminates some of the core principles and lessons learned from developing the Playdate. You should gopher it and read it, but I plucked my favorite highlights.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Platform owners need not be the gatekeepers of all content and money. A platform can thrive without needing to have their finger in every single pie.  This is, in fact, the way it used to be by default in the industry for a very long time and everyone did quite well.  Anyone can make a Playdate game and distribute it or sell it however they choose.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love it and it feels somewhat anti-Capitalist, anti-AppStore, or (in a gaming context) anti-Metaverse when most platforms want to insert themselves in the middle of every transaction, taking a cut.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;When you buy hardware, you own it and have the right to do what you want with it, including developing and installing your own software.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A wonderful ethos about hardware ownership, especially coming from a traditionally Mac-centered company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;I know everything is kind of depressing recently, but color is OK, shapes are OK, and joyfulness can be a feature.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could take Sharpies to my screen and underline these characters in my terminal. “Joyfulness can be a feature.” 🤩&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Limitations like monochrome displays and a minimum of buttons and controls are not only rocket fuel for developer creativity, but also broaden Playdate’s appeal to people who may find modern games intimidating or out of reach due to their complexity.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of Gunpei Yokoi’s “Lateral thinking with withered technology” or the interplay between play (”fun”) and rules. Rules, somewhat counterintuitively, are what make games fun. Thinking of limitations as “rocket fuel for developer creativity” is something I identify with as I look for simple tools in my own development practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The result of adding more constraints means that the products have a broader appeal due to their simple interface. It reminds me of a Jeremy Keith talk I heard last month about programming languages like CSS which have a simple interface pattern: &lt;code&gt;selector { property: value }&lt;/code&gt;. Simple enough anyone can learn. But simple doesn’t mean it’s simplistic, which gives me a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The end of the post turns towards thoughts about modern technology…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Maybe I’m attempting to build a grandiose mythology where none exists,&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m okay with people building grandiose mythologies… keep going…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;we don’t have to just sit by and watch as 2 or 3 massive corporations consume each other and gradually become the sole arbiters of what you can and cannot do with technology.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a violent, pointed finger. And yes, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Maybe crushing every competitor needn’t be the goal of every business.  Maybe, just maybe, it is good for alternatives to popular ideas to exist.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My heart is pounding in sympathetic applause as we approach the end of the post…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;So, at the risk of sounding trite: look forward, but study history. Have goofy ideas and don’t measure their value exclusively in dollars. Never stop playing.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. I’m here for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 21:06:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/05/notes-from-a-gopher-site/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/05/notes-from-a-gopher-site/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check  №16</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A new lawn&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/lawn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My front yard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surprise remodeling project! Setting the landscape (heh), while the existing landscaping was wonderful and charming, in practice it didn’t work well for our family. My wife and I worked hard to narrow the scope and priority of the projects we needed done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Project #1: The front yard&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The front yard zeroscape treatment featured two amoeba-shaped rings of grass surrounded by crushed granite rocks. Modern, low maintenance, but the slope of the front yard causes all those rocks wash into the street every time it rains. I get the joy of looking like an asshole once a month shoveling the rocks from the street back into my yard. &lt;strong&gt;Project #1: Replace rocks with grass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also needed some concrete steps, but I didn’t want to blow the scope of the project and delay it further by mixing trades, so this was #4 on our list of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Project #2: The rock pit&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the backyard I worked hard to remove a big area of english ivy and revealed a rock pit. Yikes. A haven for snakes, roaches, and mosquitos. I removed the rocks and thankfully my other neighbor Jason took some of those rocks, but I still had two mounds of dirt surrounding the pit that must have been a pond at some point. Now every kid loves a rock pit to play in, but a flat patch of grass would be more useful to our family. &lt;strong&gt;Project #2: Fill pit with dirt and cover with grass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Project #3: The side yard&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the side yard, we had another english ivy zone that didn’t do much other than eat lost toys. Ideally this could be usable space where we could park our garbage cans or possibly another camper one day. This was a stretch goal. &lt;strong&gt;Project  #3: Convert ivy side yard to a crushed granite pad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;I love it when a plan comes together&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was happy to do this all as separate projects over different months, but José and his crew made some on the fly decisions that tied the projects together and made everything more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They removed the rocks from the front yard (Project #1) and dumped them in the side yard (Project #3). Then they took the dirt mounds from the rock pit (Project #2) and used that as fill for the front yard where the rocks were (Project #1). After about two days of work, we were ready for the four pallets of sod.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we were preparing for the grass, José said he knew a concrete guy. A couple of quick conversations and we were pouring concrete within the week. The total turnaround time on the entire project was about 2 weeks. In the blink of an eye, I had a new front and back yard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;St. Augustine is a hearty stubborn grass that grows well here in Texas. It’s a bit water-hungry and I know that’s going to bite me in the upcoming Water Wars, but I think grass was a good choice and my microbiome seems to support it (we were the only rock yard on the street). And the results seem to have had a cooling effect on the whole property. The other grass seems happier, the trees seem happier, I’m happier; it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s a sense of relief and pride that comes with finishing a project that’s been on your dockett for years. We now have a usable front yard that doesn’t stab your feet as you run out to grab something from the car barefoot. With the shed, the flattened lawn, and the trampoline, we now have the backyard we’ve envisioned for awhile. It’s all come together. That project’s done. Next we battle the mosquitos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;My web component workshop and my web component talk&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second week of April I headed up to Minneapolis to do my &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/&quot;&gt;Frontend Masters&lt;/a&gt; workshop. My whole year so far had been working towards that, so there’s a sense of relief to have that checked off my to-do list. A months worth of nights and weekends went into preparing the course, building an entire online guidebook for the course, and making slides. Then for that workshop day you have to upload an internet’s worth of know-how into your “Brain RAM”, it’s a bit overwhelming. But I think it went well, I learned a lot about giving workshops, and I look forward to people’s feedback when the course gets released.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The next week I did my web components talk at An Event Apart and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/513/&quot;&gt;LIVE ShopTalk&lt;/a&gt; as well. The crew at An Event Apart work hard to put on a good conference. Wil Reynolds’s talk on SEO keeps rattling around in my brain the most. He spoke about how the context of words change when they’re next to other words, and if you manage to win the keyword lottery how do you meet customers expectations by delivering on those words. You should find this talk, I’m not doing it justice. Thanks again to AEA for having me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus ends this spring conference season for me. I haven’t made any hard decisions about speaking at future conferences, but I am acknowledging to myself they are a tough fit for me and my life right now while starting a new company (Luro). As I understand my chaos brain a bit more, diverting extra brain cycles to prepare a talk while doing my job, life, kids, etc was a skill… but now it’s a pretty risky maneuver to add to the Jenga tower of obligations without careful consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Baseball and the suburban life&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are deep into the shuttling kids around to their activities lifestyle. While my wife does most of this, I spent a lot of April evenings down at the baseball fields with my son Otis. I didn’t know if he’d every want to try baseball again after COVID cancelled his first season of baseball. A weird side effect of parenting small kids thru COVID is its not uncommon that they might have missed some critical socialization windows or —in our case— learning how to play group sports. Thankfully they have a cohort of kids in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As each week progresses Otis is getting better at hitting, throwing, and fielding. It’s great to see him start to figure out the mechanics of the game and his body. Although it wreaks havoc on bedtime routines, it’s been a fun ritual to be out watching these kids learn and play the game under the lights of the field. It’s a good little taste of Americana.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Baseball is a bit of a flash mob event though and the season ends the first week of May. He’s excited his team has a chance to go to the championship, but I can’t tell if that’s a real thing or a thing he and his teammates made up. I think we’re already looking at signing up “fall ball”, my daughter Emi wants to play too. Looking forward to that if it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I turned 42&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the month, I added another year to the sum of my lifespan. This happen most years so it wasn’t a shock. Somewhere Neil deGrasse Tyson is saying “Space doesn’t care about your birthday”, but birthdays are still nice to have sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this year, we kept it a bit low-key and had groups of friends from different corners of my life gathered at my house in my new backyard. We ate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinterstellarbbq.com/&quot;&gt;BBQ&lt;/a&gt; and drank &lt;a href=&quot;https://punchdrink.com/articles/chartreuse-very-own-party-drink-swampwater-cocktail/&quot;&gt;swampwater&lt;/a&gt; while herds of kids migrated between the house and trampoline and back, zig-zagging around us like the mosquitos. I had a great afternoon/evening and I’m thankful to know such wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What you all actually came for.

I thought I was alone until Jim Nielsen posted his comparison &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/&quot;&gt;Comparing Data in Google and Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. My data story and Jim’s data story end up similar (we’re both popular in Germany?); a situation where the more data you have, the less the data seems true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The data&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s my data from Mar 25th, 2022 ~ April 25th, 2022. The data collection methods differ like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/&quot;&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt; is a client-side script served from a self-hosted, first-party subdomain (&lt;code&gt;stats.daverupert.com&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; processes raw server log data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think these are both great products that you should totally use over other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Total visits&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Fathom (Client-side)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Netlify (Server-side)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Unique visitors&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;12,300&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;26,085&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Pageviews&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;18,000&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;333,801&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These couldn’t be more different. 2.1× the visitors, 18.5× the pageviews.

Even stripping those outliers from the results in the table above, the top 10 posts from each service return wildly different traffic numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doing some napkin math comparisons…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;URL&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Discrepancy&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;/&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;17.5×&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;/about/&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2.4×&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;/archive/&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.9×&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;/2022/04/7-web-component-tricks/&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1.8×&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;/2022/04/what-if-everything-got-better/&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.2×&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;/2022/04/vibe-check-15/&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.9×&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The discrepancies are not consistent at all. If these were similar, we might be able to say 75% of people use ad blockers and believe the large numbers, but it’s not so cut and dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Top locations&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Pageviews&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Germany&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;75,359&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Finland&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;70,605&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;United States&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;60,031&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Canada&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;45,305&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;China&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;28,092&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;13,345&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;UK&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5,960&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My version of Fathom doesn’t give me country data, but I’m including my Netlify data here which I’ll use to make a point later. You may have noticed something is a little fishy about this data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDEL4Ty950Q&quot;&gt;jump to any conclusions&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to check my data with their sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Feedback from Fathom and Netlify&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I tweeted about this phenomenon in 2019…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Server-side &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Netlify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@netlify&lt;/a&gt; stats vs. Client-side &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/usefathom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@usefathom&lt;/a&gt; stats (over the last ~4 weeks)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;439k pageviews vs 12.5k pageviews&lt;br&gt;44k uniques vs. 7.9k uniques &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ARoW82BhAm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ARoW82BhAm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dave Rupert (@davatron5000) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davatron5000/status/1149321252676485120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 11, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After tweeting about it Netlify and Fathom both reached out to me. It’s a bit of a he-said/she-said situation about who’s data is most correct, but some high-level notes add value to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fathom’s point of view was that I was on the outdated community product and the SaaS product is much better and more accurate now. I don’t doubt the paid product is better, but I do doubt it would close the 18× gap on the Netlify numbers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Netlify’s take was pretty matter-of-fact. “Yup. This reflects the log data.” They’re not wrong, raw server logs don’t lie. Their investigation into the matter turned up two anomalies I can’t solve:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;80% of the hits to my Responsive Deliverables post contain a &lt;code&gt;utm_campaign=&lt;/code&gt; query param, which tells me people love my footnote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://smacss.com/&quot;&gt;SMACSS&lt;/a&gt;. Some bot (in Germany?) must be hammering &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/?utm_content=buffer79cd1&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=bufferfnref:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfnref:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfnref:SMACSSfn:SMACSSfn1fn1fnref1fn1&quot;&gt;that campaign URL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Uptime Monitor&lt;/a&gt; health check pointed at my site. This is helpful, except that I never set one up! Another rogue bot (in Germany?) is pinging my old content thousands of times a day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fathom’s numbers seem more believable but Netlify’s data eliminates any ad blocking questions. My one small takeaway is that it’d be nice if I could filter out known bot traffic from Netlify’s reporting. That might remove the delta to an acceptable degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Big conclusions about data-driven decision making&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The data tells me I get somewhere between 12k and 26k visitors to my site who open anywhere between 18k and 333k pages. If I stare at the larger numbers, that is impressive but not actionable. Comparing 2019 to 2022, Netlify is showing a 25% drop in pageviews and a 41% drop in uniques, while Fathom is showing almost the inverse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a judgement on Netlify or Fathom, they are both incredible services that offer incredible analytics products. But it leaves me in a position of wondering who should I believe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;My trust level in analytics products is low&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My trust in analytics data is at an all-time low. Browser-level privacy improvements, ad blockers, and bot traffic have obliterated the data integrity. Unless I’m a certified statistician, I’m unable to accurately assess traffic to &lt;a href=&quot;https://trentwalton.com/2011/03/30/ideas-of-march/&quot;&gt;my breakfast table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I used to believe people were honest, but seeing all this bot traffic on my little site I could see how someone might point bots at their own site to inflate their traffic stats, gain perceived popularity, which they then pass on to advertisers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbonads.net/faq&quot;&gt;My ad vendor’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; has a note that says “Bots account for as much as 80% of website traffic”, yikes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Data-driven decisions can be a blindspot&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I believed Netlify’s data as gospel, I would be a blogging sensation! I should quit my job and do blogging fulltime. Four million eyeballs per year. Following Netlify’s data to its logical extreme, I should be structuring my new blogging business like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing a lot of content about responsive design and 4K monitors.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investing  a lot in German and Finnish localized content.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I’d should be in full panic mode about my 41% drop in uniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love Germany (and I hear Finland is great), but I suspect they’re not my #1 and #2 markets. And those vintage 2014 posts are okay, but should not be the core of my content strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I, or some hypothetical manager, put too much stock into these metrics I could see it causing a firestorm of reprioritization based on bot traffic&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We’d be chasing the tail of a health check bot somewhere in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The point is, you can enter a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy&quot;&gt;McNamara Fallacy&lt;/a&gt; if you base your business solely on quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;You need more than just metrics&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Probably old advice, but you need a mixture of quantitative AND qualitative data to make good decisions. In &lt;em&gt;Just Enough Research,&lt;/em&gt; Erika Hall drives home a point that I think applies here:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You want to know what is happening (qualitative), how much it’s happening (quantitative) and why it’s happening (qualitative).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to grow your product, you need a mixture of research (academic and applied), user tests, A/B tests, analytics, performance audits&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, accessibility audits&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and a plethora of other considerations. Even if you have all those processes in place, I still think you need a human — a sage — who can read the tea leaves and interpret the data in a way that the business understands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your goal is not to grow your site… maybe ignorance is bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe pointing a bot army at a competitor’s site to skew metrics is some next level Art of War shit. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Every 100ms of latency costs Amazon 1% of sales (&lt;a href=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/08/radar-theme-web-ops.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) /via &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpostats.com/&quot;&gt;WPO Stats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1 in 4 adults in the United States have a disability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) /via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.a11yproject.com/&quot;&gt;A11y Project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 13:41:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/server-side-vs-client-side-analytics/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/server-side-vs-client-side-analytics/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Inspiration in the Tall Grass</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zmoUXKHp3Bw&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite among them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfcVnPae2JerM0iRT82aVQ&quot;&gt;Al Bladez&lt;/a&gt;. Al and his best friend AP take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and &lt;em&gt;whew&lt;/em&gt;, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 04:23:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/inspiration-in-the-tall-grass/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/inspiration-in-the-tall-grass/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>An unplanned open redesign</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy! If you frequent this website often, you’ll notice some changes. This weekend I started on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/04/vibe-check-15/&quot;&gt;planned&lt;/a&gt; redesign, but as I started nudging my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/about/&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Website feature inventory&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;330+ blog posts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Art-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SVGs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Open Graph images (handmade)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RSS feed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;███ ████&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Code samples&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Codepen, YouTube, and Vimeo embeds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;About Timeline (YAML-powered)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bookshelf (YAML-powered)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Likes (RSS-powered)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;/uses page&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Service worker + offline page&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My checks are all manual right now, but not rocket science. I created a “secret” page to roll up &lt;a href=&quot;/artdirected&quot;&gt;all my art-directed posts&lt;/a&gt; and I’m happy to report just a few are super fucked up. One day I’ll add proper visual integration tests, but today is not that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the next step, let’s define the goals and non-goals for this project so we can finish on time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Goals and non-goals&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The goals I have outlined for myself are pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redo my typography setup&lt;/strong&gt; - After years and years of subtle tweaks, I ruined it. Time to start over, more fluid this time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New homepage&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the lowest priority, but nothing sings “redesign” like a new homepage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove Ads&lt;/strong&gt; - Ads make me ~$20/mo. Originally a motivator to blog consistently, I’ve got a flow now. Ads were also an intentional third-party constraint I used to inform client work. Since I’m moving away from client work, that experiment can end.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Remove Fathom Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/&quot;&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt; is great, but I’m paying $5/mo to self-host and I check it zero times a year. I have Netlify’s server-side analytics running on this as well. There’s a 26× disparity between those two analytics services, enough to make me think there’s no truth to metrics at all. Jim Nielsen covers this phenomenon in his post &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/&quot;&gt;Comparing Data in Google and Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Expose tags&lt;/strong&gt; - I want to do a better job at tagging and categorization of posts for my own sake and I think elevating that will help.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Annual stats&lt;/strong&gt; -  Another feature for me, I like to keep track of my progress over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Syntax Highlighting&lt;/strong&gt; - I had this once with client-side Prism.js, then I took it off, now I want it back. I’m using server-side &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arokettu/commonmarker-rouge&quot;&gt;Rouge + Commonmark&lt;/a&gt; in Jekyll.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Support page&lt;/strong&gt; - How can you give me $10? If I’m removing ads, might as well sell my own products and services.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My list of non-goals would include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not replatform the blog to Eleventy&lt;/strong&gt; (or Astro) or whatever. I’d love to not be on Jekyll, but that’s a separate project. Tooling is a lot better on a Node stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not go down a testing rabbit hole.&lt;/strong&gt; Spot checks or automated webperf/accessibility tests would be beneficial, but it’d be easier on a Node stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not automate opengraph images&lt;/strong&gt; - Auto-generated opengraph images would be rad, but again, easier on a Node stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With those parameters defined, let’s do a status check…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Status check!&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What you’re looking at now is the lightly styled bones of my site. No Sass, no JavaScript, nothing but Jekyll static site compilation. I’m pleased with how the website is shaping up with basic browser defaults. I’ve got ~2.37kb of global CSS (926b gzipped) and I don’t see the need for much beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIP Newshammer, long live Newshammer:&lt;/strong&gt; Astute readers will notice Newshammer is not on the site anymore. That’s not a permanent decision, but I am leaving opportunity/room to do something different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m embracing browser defaults for type right now, with two or three exceptions. I’m soft-committing to &lt;code&gt;system-ui&lt;/code&gt; for now because I had some recent trouble rendering headings in other languages. The article &lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; is the only heading I see that feels a little too small, but I’d be happy if that’s all the typesetting I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spacing:&lt;/strong&gt; I have seven margin declarations and most of those are resets. Liberal usage of Grid and Flexbox using &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt; to manage consistent spacing. Super happy about this. Even the posts are one giant grid. I may abstract my grids into some layout utility classes…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.layout-grid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.layout-grid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* https://daverupert.com/2017/09/breaking-the-grid/ */&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.layout-grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;data-vibe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;compact&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.75rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.layout-grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;data-vibe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;comfortable&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This would probably remove half my existing CSS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charts n’ graphs:&lt;/strong&gt; I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/css-grid-bar-charts&quot;&gt;Josh Collinsworth’s post on CSS Grid bar charts&lt;/a&gt; for my Archive page. Happy with this. It needs some work to be fully accessible (context-less labels) but it’s presentational at its core.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flagpole:&lt;/strong&gt; One stylized component I have right now is the “flagpole” look for my Post Archives and About Timeline. I’m not attached to the flagpole treatment, but I do think visually grouping content by years is super helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I’ve already been able to land &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/what-if-everything-got-better/&quot;&gt;some accessibility fixes&lt;/a&gt; around my document heading structure which I’m pretty glad about. I noticed my HTML is also “over-classed” with a lot of half-baked &lt;code&gt;.hentry&lt;/code&gt; microformats that I brought over from WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/brander-newer/&quot;&gt;ten years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I’m looking forward to mowing those down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That’s all I have for now. Tune in next week for more changes and CSS riffin’!&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 22:35:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/an-unplanned-open-redesign/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/an-unplanned-open-redesign/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Productivity-sniped by PARA</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;In February, I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/356/&quot;&gt;nerd-sniped&lt;/a&gt; by a mention on Twitter about a productivity system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/&quot;&gt;PARA&lt;/a&gt;. PARA is a way to organize your digital life in to separate buckets: &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;rojects, &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;reas, &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;esources, and &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rchives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IzG_SLAjP40&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After watching some videos, I started applying PARA to my second brain in Notion. The timing to choose to redo my entire Notion setup was horrible, of course. I was busy with work, writing a workshop, moving ShopTalk to its own YouTube channel… why not pick up another big project and redo my entire organization system?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The psychology checks out though. When large tasks loom you don’t feel in control over your schedule and doing something you can control (like organizing your organizer) helps you feel more in control. And it did help. Quantifying the “Projects” I’m committed to over various “Areas” gave me a more solid perspective of what I’m doing, why I’m doing them, and when they’re due… rather than a constant state of overwhelm. I’m pleased with the results so far…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/PARA.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Notion’s Areas database which contains thumbnail cards for areas like Luro, Blogging, Speaking, Paravel, YouTube, Open Source, Shop Talk Show, Camping, Home Ownership, Health, Parenting, Hobbies, etc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebI3zExav2c&quot;&gt;Inspired by Marie Poulin&lt;/a&gt;, I took some liberties and created a global “Task” database as well as made a dashboard for some even more meta-level “Objectives” or goals that act like personal OKRs&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There’s a table of &lt;code&gt;Results&lt;/code&gt; I want to achieve and &lt;code&gt;Metrics&lt;/code&gt; I’m using to gauge that progress. Overkill, I know, &lt;em&gt;but it’s my overkill&lt;/em&gt; and it’s already helping me set some sights on personal and professional goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest paradigm shift from PARA is the idea that &lt;strong&gt;projects have an end date&lt;/strong&gt;. This is hard for me; a person who tends to have a lot of open-ended, never-ending projects. I’ve logged those never-ending projects like open source, podcasting, or gaming as “Areas” for now, but that feels a bit mismatched because they do require recurring participation. That said, the process has been illuminating. I’m not making major life changes yet, but it has opened my eyes to the fact that I need more “close-ended projects” in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Notion still needs some cleaning up but the broad strokes are working for now. I haven’t rolled this out to every digital corner, but I think this will work for at least until my next annual refactor. If you’re doing PARA in Notion, I’d love to hear about it or how you’ve modified it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pro-tip: Quarterly OKRs are working much better than Annual OKRs. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:33:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>My Weekly Engineering Report</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Providing visibility into your work is one of the most underrated developer soft skills. Coworkers are often too busy to keep track of what’s going on with engineering work, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; if it’s their job to know what’s going on with engineering work. It’s generally not out of malice or lack of interest, but a lack of time and energy to chase down every issue or conversation thread. And to be fair, engineering is an opaque process where we trick the rocks inside a computer to act like a business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Standups are a great tool for sharing visibility. Unfortunately, not everyone loves standups. I’ve personally experienced some extremely toxic scrum master situations. Impersonal bots can have the same effect. A daily status report can feel like micromangement leading to a loss of autonomy. Also, that visibility into your work evaporates after attendees leave the call.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the past four or five years, I’ve been practicing an alternative to daily standups. Rather than waiting for people to confront you, I find it better to &lt;strong&gt;proactively share your progress in a brief bulleted list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in a public channel (of appropriate level). That’s the secret: share without being asked. The template has evolved a bit over the years, but here’s what it looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-md highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;md&quot;&gt;💪 &lt;span class=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;**Progress**&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Fixed something project#123\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Added something project#234\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Documented something\n\n😖 &lt;span class=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;**Regressions**&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Found bug on something project#345\n\n🧪 &lt;span class=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;**Prototypes**&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Experimented with new feature codepen.io/123\n\n💬 &lt;span class=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;**To Discuss**&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Blocked on something project#456\n \n📆 &lt;span class=&quot;gs&quot;&gt;**This Week**&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Work on new feature project#567\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Out of office on Friday\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That’s a … uh … standup?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It’s basically a standup in newsletter form. It could be the years working in a Japanese office talking, but I don’t hate standups. They are great for mind-melding. But, as I’ve experienced, not everyone thrives in standups. But the sharing part is valuable, I try to keep doing the sharing part.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve done this in solo contexts, team contexts, and external client-facing contexts and no one hates it. No one says, “God, Dave, I wish you’d quit summarizing what’s going on.” No one asks for it, I just post it. People —especially those that pay you— enjoy seeing progress made and you (or your team) can avoid a lot of workplace mistrust issues by broadcasting a short progress report.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consistency helps. Any weekday works but I’ve found posting on Monday mornings provides a nice recap of last week’s progress and sets a baseline for expectations in the upcoming week. It’s also a good opportunity to publicly celebrate specific people or any team wins as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus sums up my entire software development philosophy: &lt;em&gt;Proactively communicate as succinctly as possible what you’re working on, what problems you ran into, and what you’re working on next.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bulleted list part is maybe the most important part. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:57:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/my-weekly-engineering-report/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/my-weekly-engineering-report/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>7 Web Component Tricks</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished my &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/&quot;&gt;Frontend Masters Web Components Course&lt;/a&gt;. To &lt;del&gt;market it&lt;/del&gt; celebrate that accomplishment, I wanted to share ~7 tips and tricks I’ve learned preparing my course or I feel aren’t super obvious about Web Components.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. You can manipulate props right on a Lit element&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This may be something only I would do, but if you make an element with Lit that exposes its properties, you can edit those props externally using &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;my-counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;counter=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/my-counter&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;my-counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. :host-context let’s you style an element based on its parent&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;:host-context()&lt;/code&gt; to style an element based on its parent. Your HTML may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;my-element&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/my-element&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;card&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;my-element&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/my-element&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In your CSS inside the Web Component, you have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:host-context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;pink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:host-context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;::after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'I’m in a card'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/jOYKKPN&quot;&gt;See Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Declarative ShadowDOM&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;my-element&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shadowroot=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;open&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\t  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a spooky skeleton screen 💀&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/my-element&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Declarative Shadow DOM enables server-side rendering of Web Components, but one thing that’s not clear is your inlined template and the components actual template can be totally different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/PoEBezm&quot;&gt;See Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Open WC has a project starter&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; for Web Components, the folks at Open WC have you covered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;npm init @open-wc\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You get so much from this (local server, testing configs, a storybook, production rollup config, etc) but my favorite bit is from the sample component’s test file: it runs an &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/chai-a11y-axe/&quot;&gt;accessibility audit&lt;/a&gt; on your Shadow DOM!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-jsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;passes the a11y audit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fixture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&amp;lt;custom-element&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/custom-element&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;\n\n  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shadowDom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;accessible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Accessibility out of the box! Nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. You can “rebrand” other people’s components.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Want to mix and match components from different design systems but keep a consistent naming structure in your company? You can import a component and “rebrand” it or even add functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-jsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CoolButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;cool-design-system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OurButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CoolButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;our-button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OurButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;6. The Open WC Publishing Guides are cool&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The OpenWC group also has some nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/publishing/&quot;&gt;community guidelines for publishing Web Components&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;✅ Do publish latest standard EcmaScript&lt;br /&gt;\n✅ Do publish standard es modules&lt;br /&gt;\n✅ Do include &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;index.js&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;index.js&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n✅ Do export element classes&lt;br /&gt;\n✅ Do export side effects separately&lt;br /&gt;\n✅ Do import 3rd party node modules with “bare” import specifiers&lt;br /&gt;\n✅ Do include file extensions in import specifiers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;❌ Do not optimize&lt;br /&gt;\n❌ Do not bundle&lt;br /&gt;\n❌ Do not minify&lt;br /&gt;\n❌ Do not use &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; file extensions&lt;br /&gt;\n❌ Do not import polyfills&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That’s helpful and hopefully provides a consistent experience, allowing for a consistent bundling story, and preventing weird footguns that might occur when trying to use other people’s Web Components in your project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;7. You don’t need build tools until the very, very end.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to write Web Components, you can write vanilla web components and use ES Modules to join them together. You can use a web component library like Lit with an &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statement pointed at &lt;code&gt;skypack.dev&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unpkg.com&lt;/code&gt;. It’s super handy to get started with zero tooling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to install packages off of &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; … you could try &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/import-maps&quot;&gt;Import Maps&lt;/a&gt; … but otherwise you’ll need a local dev server (&lt;code&gt;vite&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@web/dev-server&lt;/code&gt;) that supports “bare import specifiers”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s only when going to production that you need tooling specific to your site’s needs. TypeScript is optional, bundling is optional, minifying code is optional. From a Web Component perspective, these are all considered “application-level concerns” that happen at deployment time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open-wc.org/docs/building/rollup/&quot;&gt;Rollup build script examples&lt;/a&gt; are out there, but Web Components don’t prescribe how to build your application, they don’t hitch you to an architecture. It could be a whole tree-shaken SPA (single page app), but Web Components also work well in a MPA (multi-page app) architecture. It’s up to you and your application to figure out what fits best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Stay tuned for more Web Component content&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want more Web Component content, stay tuned! I learned a bunch and it feels worth it to share. Also, if you’re a visual learner, my Frontend Masters course should be up soon so keep a look out over there, I’ll also post about it here, don’t worry 😉&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 15:58:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/7-web-component-tricks/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/7-web-component-tricks/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>What if... one day everything got better?</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;One day I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrvaSqN76h4&quot;&gt;this video about Muharrem&lt;/a&gt;, a deaf man, and how his whole neighborhood conspired against him for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UrvaSqN76h4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here I am, crying at my desk, moved to tears by an advertisement for a Samsung product in Turkey. You watch as Muharrem’s expression moves from confused, to disbelief, to overwhelm. Muharrem tears up, I tear up. Imagine what it must feel like to leave your house and the mismatch you feel every day got erased; the world works for you in a way that it didn’t before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What if…&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if we could do this with the Web. What if… one day everything got better?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/million/&quot;&gt;WebAIM Million Project&lt;/a&gt; scans the top 1,000,000 homepages and runs automated accessibility tests on them. In the report WebAIM identifies six (6) categories of issues that account for 96.5% of the over 50 million detectable errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Low contrast text&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/alt-text/&quot;&gt;Missing alt text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empty links&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Missing form input labels&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empty buttons&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Missing document language&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most shocking revelation is: &lt;strong&gt;All these issues are easy-to-detect and easy-to-fix!&lt;/strong&gt; I believe if we’re all laser focused on these six issues we can make a dent in the WebAIM Million and maybe the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m confident it’ll make a difference. Holly Tuke documented some of her experiences in a post called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/&quot;&gt;5 most annoying website features I face as a blind person every single day&lt;/a&gt;” — her list of issues is nearly the same the WebAIM Million’s list of issues! It’s one data point, but there’s millions out there like Holly who would benefit from even the most basic fixes to your website.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;When?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Accessibility Awareness Day&lt;/strong&gt; (GAAD) this year is on &lt;strong&gt;May 19, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. I can’t think of a better day. That gives you or your company about 6+ weeks to land some minor fixes on your homepages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you visit this in the future, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Accessibility_Awareness_Day&quot;&gt;GAAD is every third Thursday of May&lt;/a&gt;. Roadmap accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to find and detect these issues are to use one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/&quot;&gt;Google Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; (built-in Chrome Web Inspector)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibilityinsights.io/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Accessibility Insights&lt;/a&gt; (browser extension)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They’re both based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/axe/&quot;&gt;Deque’s axe Accessibility Testing Tool&lt;/a&gt; which you can also use. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wave.webaim.org/&quot;&gt;WebAIM’s WAVE&lt;/a&gt; evaluation tool is also great. If you haven’t done this before, there will be lots of errors, but stay focused on the six issues above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to fix the entire web, we’re trying to make a dent. There’s a lot to fix, but I’m a firm believer we need to start somewhere and these six types of issues are –in the nuanced world of accessibility– the easiest to fix. A roadmap of fifty million issues begins with a single step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What do I get out of it?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yikes. Well… You can write a company blog post saying you took part in GAAD. That goes over well. You get some organic traffic. More users can use your website, they’ll buy your goods. Your site won’t be fully WCAG2 compliant, but at least you checked off some of the lowest hanging (&lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.ada.gov/web-guidance/#examples-of-website-accessibility-barriers&quot;&gt;robo-lawyer&lt;/a&gt;) fruit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What if I finished?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Awesome work! Next, identify other core templates of your site and repeat. Think about the whole experience. One thing I heard this weekend was how it’s more frustrating to get to the end of a gigantic flow and an accessibilty error (like unlabelled buttons) prevents you from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said above, your site won’t be fully accessible after this, but I applaud you and your team because you’ve taken a major step on your accessibility journey. You can try your hand at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM4nKEZyOjE&quot;&gt;guided manual tests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://makeitfable.com/accessibility-testing-fable-engage/&quot;&gt;Run user tests&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#professional-testers&quot;&gt;hire a professional&lt;/a&gt; to give you a full audit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Share, translate, commit!&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you’re in. I think we can do it. Six issues in six weeks. Knock them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to make a website about this where people can sign, sponsor, or put logos on it, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to translate this post to your native language, all I ask is you provide a link back to the original here in case information changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 15:04:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/04/what-if-everything-got-better/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/04/what-if-everything-got-better/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №15</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;March came and gone. I chased fitness. We went on Spring Break. Growing a business. Baseball games. Failed on blogging. Here is a retelling of the vibes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Closing my rings&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This month I decided I would undergo a challenge to close my rings on my Apple Watch every single day for the whole month and I succeeded!&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;photo-gallery style=&quot;display:grid; gap: 1.5rem; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/rings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iOS Activity app showing a calendar with rings closed every day of March.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/weight.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iOS Health app showing a graph of my weight over time, hovering between 243 pounds and 245 pounds&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/photo-gallery&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say this hasn’t ever happened. My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts. As far as workout programs go, I appreciate the body diversity in Apple Fitness+ — it’s not a bunch of yoga thin hard bodies yelling at me to touch my toes to my ears, it’s real people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Did it make a difference in my weight? No. Not at all. In fact, I weigh a half pound more. My consumption habits were the same, I did nothing extravagant or different. Not much to glean except that I believe this experiment showed me that my weight is not a function of exercise, even 10x my normal exercise doesn’t make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the last month is that I’ve carved a bit of a routine into my life. Made some space for me. I have a good sense of what it takes to close my rings each day and it feels sustainable. I feel more fit, even though no one else would know it from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The late flight to Phoenix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Spring Break we decided to visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Phoenix. Hands down one of the worst flights of my life; a woman too drunk to fly, police to escort her, and her husband (also drunk) deciding to talk back to the police. Per FAA protocol, we all had to deplane to resolve the situation. Another lesson in how much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/03/antisocial-behavior-crime-violence-increase-pandemic/627076/&quot;&gt;the pandemic has effected our ability to function in society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But we got there, sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac for a gate, and arrived at grandma’s house in Phoenix at 3 AM Austin time. Wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The kids had a great visit though. Grandparents and cousins work wonders. Cousins self-propel each other. Pools, sunshine, zoo trips, and more. My wife and I could go on long walks, look at campers, and have a couple margaritas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The “time off” wasn’t as restful as I needed, due in part to some lingering obligations hanging over my head…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Work, talks, and workshops&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a busy but important time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro&lt;/a&gt;. Onboarding new customers but also figuring out next steps in the life of our startup and evaluating a pretty big architectural change (dedicated managed instances → complete multi-tenant application). Lots of discussions and ambient stress. I fried my brain one day doing a cost-benefit analysis on Rails versus Nuxt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adding on to my normal workload, I prepared a talk for An Event Apart and a workshop for Frontend Masters workshop, both on Web Components. It’s been a big year for web components and I’m happy to continue talking about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoy presenting. I feel like it fits within my natural range of extroversion. Talks and workshops are a lot of work though piled on a busy schedule. After years of practice, I feel like I do a decent job estimating the work required and am able to plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidly, the one thing I don’t predict well is the cloud of stress that looms over me a month or so before an event. It’s a looming feeling of excess obligations. As much as I love doing these presentations, they add a lot to a busy schedule and even busier mind. But that impulse to say “no” to future talks conflicts with my impulse to amortize my talks as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;One day without caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I inadvertently attempted a caffeine fast. 10am and I hadn’t had any coffee, so I decided to try it. It did not go well. I was in bed at 4pm with a cursed headache. I went to bed with a headache. I woke up with a headache. I was grumpy, irritable, and almost deleted my whole Twitter account. It took me by surprise how awful my body reacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently 50% of people suffer caffeine withdrawal headaches and it sort of doesn’t matter how much caffeine you have (over 200mg/day). I’m in the unlucky half. I think it’s worthwhile to break chains of addiction when they present themselves, so I may attempt a fast again but may ween myself with half-caf for a bit first before I try again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;💪 &lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closed my rings 31 times.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Didn’t do much pickleball.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🧶 &lt;strong&gt;Crafting&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usagundamstore.com/products/hg-1-144-gundam-ground-urban-combat-type&quot;&gt;Gundam Ground Combat Urban Type&lt;/a&gt; and it may be my most favorite one yet. &lt;a href=&quot;/images/posts/2022/urbancombat.jpg&quot;&gt;Here’s a picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 books + 2 graphic novels\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/141973069X.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/a&gt; - John Lewis’s retelling of America after the Civil Rights Act and his falling out with SNCC.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3hIb2Ir&quot;&gt;The City of Ember&lt;/a&gt; - My son read &lt;em&gt;The City of Ember&lt;/em&gt; for a book report so I read the graphic novel and it’s good.

The whole street is concerned about Big Bird. If you ask me, Big Bird is being a bit of a bitch about it all but clearly he’s going through some strong feelings. The ever-graceful Buffy Sainte Marie&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; comes in to share a song with him about the different kinds of love and attention you can give people based on their needs, with the refrain “different people, different ways.” Big Bird seems placated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Different people, different ways” has been a useful parenting tool. It helps us resolve unfairness in moments of sibling rivalry, but also helps in explaining differences of the human condition. Why do they use a wheelchair? Why are they short? Why do they talk like that? Why does that kid get to play with toys in the classroom and I don’t? … Different people, different ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A simple enough refrain that if I start it, my kids will finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ask me in twenty years if it worked, but I think they already get that “fairness” can take different shapes when it’s centered around meeting different people’s different needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I love him 'cause he's tiny and small\nI love you because you're yellow and tall\nTiny and small love\nYellow and tall love\nEveryone loves through all their days\nDifferent people, different ways\n\nI love him 'cause he has to be fed\nI love you because you make your own bed\nHe has to be fed love\nYou make your own bed love\nDifferent people, different ways\n\nI love him 'cause he's small and helpless\nHe has to be washed and fed each day\nI love you cause you're big and helpful\nYou can read, sing, and play\n\nI love him 'cause he's sugar and spice\nI love you because you're awfully nice\nSugar and spice love\nAwfully nice love\nTiny and small love\nYellow and tall love\nEveryone loves through all their days\nDifferent people, different ways\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Buffy Sainte Marie once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RwZW2j3-U&quot;&gt;once breastfed Cody on Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; in a time when breastfeeding, let alone public breastfeeding, was socially unpopular.

Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/goodbye-big-freeda/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/goodbye-big-freeda/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Vibe Check №14</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Survived the freeze&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Texas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Sold the pop-up&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/camper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2010 Rockwood Freedom popup camper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over Valentine’s weekend, we tried to go camping with our friends, but the pop-up… didn’t… pop-up. We abandoned it at the campsite overnight and drove it to the RV lot the next day where we sold it for next to nothing. We could have put money into it and potentially sold it for more, but we needed out. It cost us ~$500 in maintenance every time we wanted to take it out and that caused me more stress than relaxation. Lots of memories, but a new chapter in camping begins… but not jumping back into the camper ownership game too soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Gunpla and mechanical keyboard crafting&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I made two crafts this month that I’m pleased with, but also some mixed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/heavyarms.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gundam Heavyarms 4.5” plastic model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Gundam but with extra guns, the XXXG-01H Gundam Heavyarms. This was my first High Grade (HG) 1/144th scale gunpla. It’s a cool model with lots of expression but I was initially a bit disappointed by a wobbly waist and a leg that kept falling off. Between meetings one day I decided to rebuild the legs, found the place where I messed up, and now it’s sturdy-gurdy and much more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I bought another HG model I plan on doing but am feeling the itch to go up to a Master Grade (MG) 1/100th scale model. In the meantime, I’m going to try my hand at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95MD5IXiXqE&quot;&gt;panel lining&lt;/a&gt; (I bought ~$30 worth of markers!) to add some depth to my current models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;KBDfans Mountain Ergo&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2022/mountain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alice-like ergonomic keyboard, split layout tented&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On an impulse I bought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kbdfans.com/products/ic-kbdfans-mountain-ergo-keyboard-kit&quot;&gt;KBDfans Mountain Ergo keyboard kit&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an Alice-like layout (split, but staggard layout) but the tented chassis makes it a bit more ergonomic. ~$500 is a lot for a keyboard, but I regretted missing the group buy, so I impulsively bought it when restock units went on sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Such a satisfying build. The sandwiched base-plate layers, the snap and click as switches lock in to the hotswappable circuit board, and thocky keypresses of lubed stabilizers. Finished off with a (cheap) set of all-white Japanese hiragana keycaps. It’s an absolute unit and weighs more than a newborn child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I may post a more in-depth review, but as good and beautiful as this keyboard is… I like my Moonlander better? Or I had the Moonlander tuned a bit more ergonomically for me? It’s nice to type on though, but I think my problems are more related to 60% keyboard layouts being suboptimal for development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Frontend Masters Web Components Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most February evenings went to putting together a Web Components course for &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/&quot;&gt;Frontend Masters&lt;/a&gt;. I planned the workshop, made a website, and got feedback from friends in the ShopTalk Discord. Workshops aren’t my forté, but it’s coming together and feels good to be ahead of schedule rather than scrambling as the deadline approaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m also updating my web component talk for &lt;a href=&quot;https://aneventapart.com/event/spring-summit-2022&quot;&gt;An Event Apart: Spring Summit&lt;/a&gt;, so all the web component research parlays together nicely. There’s a sense of accomplishment in having turned a talk into a workshop and a website. Who knows what’s next, a book? A graphic novel? A movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Luro 📈&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another great month of progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro&lt;/a&gt;. We began onboarding our first customer which brought up a lot of major and minor issues with the application, nearly tripling the number of issues in the backlog. Expected, of course, but it triggered a need for better issue management (projects, labels, etc) and taking time to triage incoming issues rather than letting them remain in memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We went with GitHub’s new beta Projects feature. With Projects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2021/06/log-jams/&quot;&gt;I can view the board in a handful of dimensions&lt;/a&gt; instead of only a reverse chronological list. It’s been helpful for prioritizing issues and grouping work. The issue queue is nearly back down to pre-flood levels, but we may need some dedicated help soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has occupied a lot of my heart and worried brain. There’s a lot to say on this but to watch a tiny tyrant amass hundreds of thousands of troops, lie so brazenly, threaten nuclear war, bomb innocent civilians, all in an attempt to seize a country by force… and there’s so little we can do to stop it… it’s heart-wrenching. As I heard someone say, the ultimate outcome of this war — the great costs paid — depends entirely on a single autocrat coming to his senses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to all those who are victims of an unjust war.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;High-level recap of some stat-based metrics&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;💪 &lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Closed my rings 7 times.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skill cap problems at Pickleball, a lot of 3.5/4.0+ tennis players have showed up and losing every point makes Pickleball less fun. “Git gud”, I guess or… no.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📖 &lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; - I read two books this month that touch on similar topics, but I liked one and hated the other. The juxtaposition helped me realize what kind of non-fiction books I like; those that tend to be more academic and/or written by people with PhDs.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/36sqSEP&quot;&gt;Everything is Figureoutable&lt;/a&gt; - This book comes highly recommended but I did not enjoy it. I agree with the premise, that you can figure out most problems, but the narrative frustrated me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3s3mvsg&quot;&gt;The Upside of Stress&lt;/a&gt; - This was my kind of book. Correcting old science with new science, adjacent scientific studies. Written by a PhD. I welcome the challenge to the societal mindset that stress kills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📺 &lt;strong&gt;TV, Movies, and Anime&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gundam II, Gundam III (Netflix)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;👾 &lt;strong&gt;Video games&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://olliolliworld.live/&quot;&gt;Olli Olli World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;🎙 &lt;strong&gt;Podcasts and YouTubes&lt;/strong&gt; - We moved ShopTalk over to its own YouTube channel. It’s a minor but impactful change that will allow all ShopTalk content to exist in one home.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0z_y1EirBhSQN96P4foZ1A&quot;&gt;New ShopTalk YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt; - Like and subscribe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/video/css-quiz-show/&quot;&gt;CSS Quiz Show&lt;/a&gt; - Chris and I did a couple of CSS quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;📝 &lt;strong&gt;Blogging&lt;/strong&gt; - 6 posts, 3 new formats. I started doing end-of-week link roundups, a blogging series where I pretend I’m dying or about to quit tech, and a “songcatching” series where I share meaningful songs.\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/friday-links-1/&quot;&gt;Five links for a Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/complaining-about-web-browsers/&quot;&gt;Before I go: When it comes to complaining about web browsers&lt;/a&gt; - Highest traffic post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/week-links-2/&quot;&gt;Six end of week links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/been-in-this-war-for-too-long/&quot;&gt;Been in this war for too long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/&quot;&gt;Τ’ακορντεόν&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2022/03/genbaku-o-yurusumaji/&quot;&gt;原爆を許すまじ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also… the ShopTalk Discord braintrust and I have determined that I need to redesign my website. Let it be recorded in the annals of time that process has begun.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 01:21:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/vibe-check-14/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/vibe-check-14/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>The 15 minute fix vs the 30 day fix</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The 15 minute fix&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The 15 minute fix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the compromise is worth it. Meeting a deadline, not over-thinking code, avoiding a maintenance burden, a lot of “unknown unknowns”, or simply finding the relief of getting something off your plate. Life is full of compromises and codebases full of tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The 30 day fix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 30 day fix is a more thoughtful abstraction. It takes a much larger chunk of time but —with the right amount of consideration and discussion— you stand a better chance at architecting and building a scalable solution in one shot. More robust, less glue code, less manual switch-flipping or knowledge transfer, a healthier baseline for the codebase going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s a feeling of relief when the 30 day fix lands. Technical debt paid down, an organized kitchen pantry, and the codebase now reflects your current understanding of the problem. Adding a line of code doesn’t feel like the whole project will topple over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But… the 30 day fix also has a hidden cost in the form of an extra 30 days of fixing the repercussions introduced by the fix itself. Breaking a test suite, an unintended side-effect, a broken layout, or a new API that leads to combing through the entire codebase to upgrade all the props to the new schema. There’s always a need to refactor a critical component to make it all work error-free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;30 days is a long time for a codebase. 60 days even more. Surely it’s cheaper to keep applying 15 minute fixes, right? Well… can I tell you a secret? Unless a small miracle happens (or your product never grows), you almost always end up needing the 30 day fix. The shortcut works for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Example: The case of the evolving API needs&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I built an API to retrieve &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; from a database. A basic CRUD sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/    # index\nGET    /posts/:id # read\nPOST   /posts/:id # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id # update\nDELETE /posts/:id # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But when I started using it, across the application I needed a speedier list view of &lt;code&gt;post.title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post.id&lt;/code&gt; fields (for a dropdown). I cracked my knuckles and wrote a 15 minute fix by creating another endpoint to solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list # index, but with less fields\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then we needed to have a category filter on the &lt;code&gt;/posts/lists&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. Another 15 minute fix added to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category? # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This worked well for a couple months until I saw four of these &lt;code&gt;/posts/list/:category&lt;/code&gt; queries on a dashboard page, but we showed ~5 records in the UI, but were fetching potentially thousands. I added another 15 minute fix to allow a &lt;code&gt;limit&lt;/code&gt; as a query param.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET    /posts/     # index\nGET    /posts/list/:category?limit=num # index, but with less fields (optional: filter by category, limit number records returned)\nGET    /posts/:id  # read\nPOST   /posts/:id  # create\nPATCH  /posts/:id  # update\nDELETE /posts/:id  # destroy\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ahh.. Are we done yet? No. Absolutely not. We’re doing a lot of data-massaging on the client that would be better (and faster) on the server. Now we need &lt;code&gt;orderBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;groupBy&lt;/code&gt; params for sorting, &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; params for an ad-hoc &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; of related records, ability to sort &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; records; a little less rigidity in the design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We — as predicted — are heading towards a 30 day fix situation. With all the added options, the &lt;code&gt;/posts/list&lt;/code&gt; endpoint is a mess — it may not even need to exist! — and we could solve a lot of problems by sitting down and thinking about the solution a little bit harder. But I actually don’t know if we made a mistake. We were running towards getting feedback. We don’t need a big infrastructure project when sandbags would fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;To build or over-build, that is the question&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough situation that comes down to estimating. Not estimating in a “choose some fake fibonacci numbers” sense, but in an overcoming personal biases sense. Are you over-estimating your need for the 30 day fix? Are you under-estimating how well the 15 minute fix is going to work? Are you operating emotionally out of a bad experience from a previous situation? Have you overcome your personal optimism bias? What’s the pressure from management like?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Often you don’t know the scope of the problem until you have users, so over-building at the beginning of the process is probably a mistake. The 15 minute fix gets you closer to actually learning what your codebase needs. But months down the line, you have a codebase full of 15 minute fixes that now need 30 day upgrades. Time-bombs. Could you have saved time by architecting the 30 day fix from the beginning? Or could you have saved a lot of money by chipping away at the problem with more and more 15 minute fixes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that’s what it comes down to: economics. A 15 minute fix and a 30 day fix have colossally different costs and impacts. Can your business afford that time? Can your users afford the delay? Is it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexsexton.com/blog/2014/11/the-monty-hall-rewrite/&quot;&gt;Monty Hall Rewrite&lt;/a&gt; problem where the fix could actually be worse once it’s landed? I struggle with this because I hate rework, but if you think of software as evolving, then rework and maintenance is part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How do you decide? I don’t know. The best advice I have is: &lt;strong&gt;Never go to the grocery store when you’re hungry&lt;/strong&gt;… but y’know, for software.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 19:27:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/15-minute-fix-vs-30-day-fix/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/15-minute-fix-vs-30-day-fix/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>原爆を許すまじ</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkUciYATc8o&quot;&gt;Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Born in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zq9pXGShrHk&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/03/genbaku-o-yurusumaji/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/03/genbaku-o-yurusumaji/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n      <item>\n        <title>Τ’ακορντεόν</title>\n        <description>&lt;p&gt;“The Accordion” (&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot;&gt;Τ’ ακορντεόν&lt;/span&gt;) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot;&gt;Μάνος Λοΐζος&lt;/span&gt;) in 1967 while Greece was under &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_junta&quot;&gt;far-right military junta control&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I first heard this song on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/americas/panama-hotel-trump.html&quot;&gt;a news story about Orestes Fintiklis&lt;/a&gt;. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LPMwsi400s&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;el&quot;&gt;\nΣτη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο\nπου ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν\nόταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος\nφωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΜα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα\nκράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν\nφασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα\nκαι μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΤ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει\nόποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν\nκι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει\nδε θα περάσει ο φασισμός\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\nIn my old neighborhood I had a friend\nwho knew and played the accordion\nwhen he sang, he was like the sun\nfires in his hands ignited by the accordion\n\nBut at one dark night, like every other night\nhe kept a look-out playing the accordion\nfascist trucks stood in the paddock\nand a gun shot stopped the accordion\n\nThe started slogan comes back to me\nwhenever I hear an accordion\nand it has marked my life like a stamp\n'Fascism will not prevail!'\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        <link>https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/</link>\n        <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/</guid>\n      </item>\n    \n  </channel>\n</rss>\n\n"
