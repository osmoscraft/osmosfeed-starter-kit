      "summary": "\nThis is the only photo I have of my old Mac Performa. Taken when I was moving out of student housing at the University of Iceland, hence the empty shelves.\n\nA prologue, of sorts\nI can’t remember when I first started to use plain text files for my notes and other writing. It would have been some time after 1995 when I was 18 and had recently spent the money I’d earned on my part-time job on a down payment for a Mac Performa.\n(I was paying for that computer for years afterwards.)\nThat computer was an upgrade from my old Mac SE and in many ways, a major improvement:\n\nColour! Thousands of them, even. So nice.\nMulti-tasking. Also great. More than one app running at a time? Sign me up.\nMore storage.\nAn option for a built-in modem. Hello, Internet!\n\nBut, and this is where the story begins to sound familiar to modern Mac users, the software was a different story. However, this time the fault wasn’t with Apple but with Microsoft.\nMy go-to application on the SE (commonly nicknamed the “kýrauga” in Icelandic, literally “porthole”) was Microsoft Word. Anything I typed I typed in Word. A small black and white screen, Word 5.1, and a mechanical keyboard made for a surprisingly good writing environment.\nWith the upgrade came a transition to Word 6.0, courtesy of ‘borrowed’ install disks from my mom’s office, and I was not happy.\nThe performance and UX disaster that was Word for Mac 6.0 is well-documented elsewhere. It’s a textbook case by now. This meant that I began to use Word less and less for personal writing and relied on it primarily for writing for school.\nI’ve always written and have always used computers for writing. I began by usign WordPerfect for DOS when I was ten years old. Switched to Word on the SE. And when Word disappointed on the Performa I began to search for alternatives. I tried ClarisWorks for a while. Even tried Nisus Writer.\nAs you might guess, all this switching meant that file format compatibility became a bit of an issue. And given that most of this was just notes and other personal writing, I eventually settled on plain text and BBedit Lite and have since then mostly stuck to plain text as my primary format for taking digital notes. My use of plain text predates my use of markdown and other markup formats (including HTML).\nFor work, I’ve always just used what I had to: Word, Google Docs, Pages, whatever. But for myself? Plain text.\nThe User Interviews\nI had forgotten about all of this when I was preparing for the user research interviews I had set up for my Colophon Cards project.\nThe interviews were a follow-up to the survey I had conducted a few weeks earlier. I wanted some more context on the data from the survey and to get some feedback on the initial paper prototype of the main view (implemented in HTML, natch). I got around a dozen people volunteering for an interview, which I split into two cohorts:\n\nFor the first, I focused on the various kinds of note-taking they were juggling in their lives: collaborative work, individual work, personal, household, hobby, etc. Followed by a short test of the initial paper prototype.\nWith the second cohort, I tried to dig more into how the various parallel note-taking processes that people used worked together. Were the analogue notes ever moved into digital? Was there a flow between the collaborative notes for work and the individual work notes? Followed by a short test of a new iteration of the paper/HTML prototype.\n\nIt’s not the sort of study you do to get conclusive actionable data. Too few participants; too unstructured; a self-selected group of expert users.\nThat last part is an especially big issue for studies like these. It’s much easier to recruit subjects who have a deep interest in the subject matter, so you tend to end up with a higher proportion of expert users than would be representative of your actual user base. And that was certainly the case here.\nThese sorts of interviews can be a good source for leads and ideas, though. I view these results more as a starting point for further testing and research.\nI wanted some context for some of the bigger questions I had after the survey. One of them was on formats and lock-in. Quite a few of the respondents looked like habitual app switchers and I wanted to find out why.\nMy motivation was quite self-serving:\n\nPeople who switch are more likely to give a new app a chance.\nIf you know what problem causes people to switch, you can address it before it happens.\n\nSo, Why Did Switchers Switch?\nA lot of it is, frankly, down to trauma. Everybody who has used computers for more than a few years has had at least one experience akin to “Word for Mac 6.0.”\n\nApps that got steadily worse with each update.\nUX degradation as features pile up.\nApps that were abandoned or even shut down as businesses' priorities changed or companies went bankrupt.\nHaving to switch OSes for some reason and discovering that an app didn’t support their new platform.\n\nThe switch for most wasn’t to markdown or a markdown app. They switched to plain text because that format works everywhere with everything. They weren’t switching to markdown specifically. Plain text lets you mix and match apps depending on the platform. You aren’t locked into the same app on desktop and mobile.\nThis is where expert user bias is important. These respondents were your ideal markdown user: technically competent, curious, and familiar with markup as a concept. They all know markdown and many of them use it regularly. But none of the benefits they described were those of markdown. They weren’t publishing these notes. They weren’t converting their notes to HTML or printing them. What they wanted was the portability and interoperability of plain text. Markdown just made plain text more usable.\nIf expert users aren’t using markdown for markdown’s sake, what are the chances that a non-expert markdown user is motivated to use it out of genuine interest in a markup format?\nTo markdown or not to markdown?\nA question that has been rattling around in my head from the start of this project—actually, from the start of my projects at Rebus a few years ago—was whether the writing widgets in the apps I work on should be based on rich text or on markdown?\nMarkdown has a number of obvious flaws. It starts off simple for most users but its mid-level or advanced features are surprisingly hard to master. Many find it quite difficult, for example, to remember what kind of bracket to use and where. Which comes first in a markdown link, the square brackets or the regular ones? Personally, I can’t, for the life of me, remember how the image markup works. I usually end up embedding an HTML image element. I don’t even know where to start with markdown tables. And I’ve been blogging with markdown for almost two decades.\nHTML markup tends to be clearer for many elements, easier to write and read, and less ambiguous. Images, tables, and even links tend to be more straightforward in HTML.\nIt’s uglier, sure. HTML source code isn’t noted for its typographic aesthetics. But clarity and consistency go a long way.\nA bigger issue is that HTML and markdown have drifted apart. Markdown doesn’t have a standard way to markup figure elements. The methods for generating an id attribute, important for cross-referencing, are also non-standard.\nBut these issues generally don’t matter if you’re writing for yourself and don’t plan on converting the text into HTML or PDF. In those cases, the primary value is the non-proprietary nature of plaintext and the features that markdown provides are just gravy on top. What matters in that context is that non-expert users aren’t likely to be even aware of markdown’s features or even markdown’s existence in the first place. The risk is that you have a bunch of users for whom markdown’s learning curve is so steep that it looks like a wall.\nRich text then?\nI’m not a fan of many of the current trends in rich text editing either.\nBlock-based editors generally started off utterly dysfunctional because they were, for the most part, flawed conceptually. (Any rich text editor that doesn’t let you select text across blocks is not fit for purpose.) The only way to ‘fix’ most of them has been for them to lose more and more of their unique characteristics. Now, ‘block-based’ has devolved into a marketing term as most of these editors are indistinguishable from their non-block-based counterparts.\nRich text editors today also tend to rely on margin or command menu buttons that are so over-loaded that they make even the most cluttered and ambitious hamburger menu look as clear and straightforward as that of MacPaint in my old SE all those decades ago. Most of them are UX messes overloaded with features.\nThe minimalist rich text editors, on the other hand, tend to be too minimal. They either rely heavily on hover state for revealing UI elements or just literally expect you to know markdown to activate many of their formatting features. The few that do neither tend to be too spartan and support little beyond basic inline formatting, a couple of heading levels, and image embeds.\nRich text widgets are also notoriously hard to implement properly (usably and accessibly) on the web. They’re extremely easy to get wrong, esp. if you’re trying to roll your own. (Don’t do that.) And if you reuse an existing widget, you tend to inherit whichever garbage UX trend was popular when that widget was first implemented. Markdown, by contrast, just needs a text area. It can benefit from more but doesn’t require it.\nRich-text widgets also raise the spectre of interoperability. People use plaintext for a reason, which is that it works everywhere, with everything, and is readable even in apps that don’t support markdown or other markup formats specifically. You could store the output of a rich text editor as HTML, which has many of the same interoperability benefits as markdown as it’s also a markup format built on plain text. But markdown has one clear advantage over HTML, which is that most of its block-defining markup is either invisible or as-good-as invisible. Paragraphs are defined by new lines. Lists are defined by looking like lists. Even headings are conceptually simple. Even if you had to use HTML for everything else, these block-level features on their own add tremendously to markdown’s usability as a plain text format.\nThis might not be an issue if you’re just using HTML for interoperability but might become an issue for users who need to edit it by hand for some reason.\nYou could use markdown as your editor interchange format but then markdown’s multiple flavours and drift from HTML becomes an issue.\nSo, what? Just give up?\nSurrender means text areas, which means markdown wins by default, except in a way that you can’t market or leverage in any meaningful way.\nInstead, I’d like to split this issue into a number of smaller problems to tackle:\n\nOngoing interoperability. The ability to integrate other apps and tools into your note-taking workflow is vital to many.\nSporadic interoperability. Being able to export files to use in other contexts and apps.\nEase of use. Being able to take notes without learning a markup format.\nPower. Being able to accomplish your note-taking or writing goals.\n\nThe interoperability issues can be tackled, using markdown even, without forcing markdown as a writing tool.\nEase of use is, quite honestly, best served with a rich text editor. They’re tricky to do well but doable.\nPower, then, becomes the toughest nut to crack. I think that’s an interesting problem in its own right. You don’t need to resort to markdown to enable power user features in note-taking.\nSo, I have an angle on this I need to research and pursue, that doesn’t necessarily require me to build a markdown-oriented app.\nAn epilogue, of sorts\nFor most of my life, I had been an avid keyboard user. I hardly ever wrote anything out by hand and had notoriously illegible handwriting. But I had completely forgotten about my initial transition into plain text in the early days of my computing life.\nA few years ago, I decided to switch most of my note-taking to analogue. I decided to prioritise my own enjoyment of the note-taking experience over productivity or automation. I switched from being a mostly keyboard and plaintext note-taker to being an avid user of paper, fountain pens, notebooks, and index cards. I later added a whiteboard (now a chalkboard) into the mix.\nWhat I found out was that my productivity and understanding of what I was working on didn’t decrease at all. Instead, it increased with my enjoyment. This is what initially prompted me to expand my ongoing research focus from digital reading to annotation, note-taking and writing as well.\nOne of the reasons why I’ve spent so many years looking at digital reading was because I felt that many of the ideas from print-based reading have been lost in the transition. We have gotten many of the basics right with our digital reading interfaces. Typography and resolution are much improved, for example. But our apps and devices rarely go beyond those basics and it’s rare to see any meaningful variations in the reading app genre.\nMy fountain pens and index cards made me realise that note-taking, esp. when you include annotation, shares many of the same problems, both in implementation, the lack of variation from the basics, and the lossy translation from print. Most importantly, they all tend to lack a sense of joy.\nHence, Colophon Cards. It might not end up being revolutionary but hopefully, with enough work, it’ll add some polish to the note-taking app genre.\n(Next, what I learned about the various kinds of note-taking from talking to a bunch of people.)",

Too few participants; too unstructured; a self-selected group of expert users.\nThat last part is an especially big issue for studies like these. It’s much easier to recruit subjects who have a deep interest in the subject matter, so you tend to end up with a higher proportion of expert users than would be representative of your actual user base. And that was certainly the case here.\nThese sorts of interviews can be a good source for leads and ideas, though. I view these results more as a starting point for further testing and research.\nI wanted some context for some of the bigger questions I had after the survey. One of them was on formats and lock-in. Quite a few of the respondents looked like habitual app switchers and I wanted to find out why.\nMy motivation was quite self-serving:\n\nPeople who switch are more likely to give a new app a chance.\nIf you know what problem causes people to switch, you can address it before it happens.\n\nSo, Why Did Switchers Switch?\nA lot of it is, frankly, down to trauma. Everybody who has used computers for more than a few years has had at least one experience akin to “Word for Mac 6.0.”\n\nApps that got steadily worse with each update.\nUX degradation as features pile up.\nApps that were abandoned or even shut down as businesses' priorities changed or companies went bankrupt.\nHaving to switch OSes for some reason and discovering that an app didn’t support their new platform.\n\nThe switch for most wasn’t to markdown or a markdown app. They switched to plain text because that format works everywhere with everything. They weren’t switching to markdown specifically. Plain text lets you mix and match apps depending on the platform. You aren’t locked into the same app on desktop and mobile.\nThis is where expert user bias is important. These respondents were your ideal markdown user: technically competent, curious, and familiar with markup as a concept. They all know markdown and many of them use it regularly. But none of the benefits they described were those of markdown. They weren’t publishing these notes. They weren’t converting their notes to HTML or printing them. What they wanted was the portability and interoperability of plain text. Markdown just made plain text more usable.\nIf expert users aren’t using markdown for markdown’s sake, what are the chances that a non-expert markdown user is motivated to use it out of genuine interest in a markup format?\nTo markdown or not to markdown?\nA question that has been rattling around in my head from the start of this project—actually, from the start of my projects at Rebus a few years ago—was whether the writing widgets in the apps I work on should be based on rich text or on markdown?\nMarkdown has a number of obvious flaws. It starts off simple for most users but its mid-level or advanced features are surprisingly hard to master. Many find it quite difficult, for example, to remember what kind of bracket to use and where. Which comes first in a markdown link, the square brackets or the regular ones? Personally, I can’t, for the life of me, remember how the image markup works. I usually end up embedding an HTML image element. I don’t even know where to start with markdown tables. And I’ve been blogging with markdown for almost two decades.\nHTML markup tends to be clearer for many elements, easier to write and read, and less ambiguous. Images, tables, and even links tend to be more straightforward in HTML.\nIt’s uglier, sure. HTML source code isn’t noted for its typographic aesthetics. But clarity and consistency go a long way.\nA bigger issue is that HTML and markdown have drifted apart. Markdown doesn’t have a standard way to markup figure elements. The methods for generating an id attribute, important for cross-referencing, are also non-standard.\nBut these issues generally don’t matter if you’re writing for yourself and don’t plan on converting the text into HTML or PDF. In those cases, the primary value is the non-proprietary nature of plaintext and the features that markdown provides are just gravy on top. What matters in that context is that non-expert users aren’t likely to be even aware of markdown’s features or even markdown’s existence in the first place. The risk is that you have a bunch of users for whom markdown’s learning curve is so steep that it looks like a wall.\nRich text then?\nI’m not a fan of many of the current trends in rich text editing either.\nBlock-based editors generally started off utterly dysfunctional because they were, for the most part, flawed conceptually. (Any rich text editor that doesn’t let you select text across blocks is not fit for purpose.) The only way to ‘fix’ most of them has been for them to lose more and more of their unique characteristics. Now, ‘block-based’ has devolved into a marketing term as most of these editors are indistinguishable from their non-block-based counterparts.\nRich text editors today also tend to rely on margin or command menu buttons that are so over-loaded that they make even the most cluttered and ambitious hamburger menu look as clear and straightforward as that of MacPaint in my old SE all those decades ago. Most of them are UX messes overloaded with features.\nThe minimalist rich text editors, on the other hand, tend to be too minimal. They either rely heavily on hover state for revealing UI elements or just literally expect you to know markdown to activate many of their formatting features. The few that do neither tend to be too spartan and support little beyond basic inline formatting, a couple of heading levels, and image embeds.\nRich text widgets are also notoriously hard to implement properly (usably and accessibly) on the web. They’re extremely easy to get wrong, esp. if you’re trying to roll your own. (Don’t do that.) And if you reuse an existing widget, you tend to inherit whichever garbage UX trend was popular when that widget was first implemented. Markdown, by contrast, just needs a text area. It can benefit from more but doesn’t require it.\nRich-text widgets also raise the spectre of interoperability. People use plaintext for a reason, which is that it works everywhere, with everything, and is readable even in apps that don’t support markdown or other markup formats specifically. You could store the output of a rich text editor as HTML, which has many of the same interoperability benefits as markdown as it’s also a markup format built on plain text. But markdown has one clear advantage over HTML, which is that most of its block-defining markup is either invisible or as-good-as invisible. Paragraphs are defined by new lines. Lists are defined by looking like lists. Even headings are conceptually simple. Even if you had to use HTML for everything else, these block-level features on their own add tremendously to markdown’s usability as a plain text format.\nThis might not be an issue if you’re just using HTML for interoperability but might become an issue for users who need to edit it by hand for some reason.\nYou could use markdown as your editor interchange format but then markdown’s multiple flavours and drift from HTML becomes an issue.\nSo, what? Just give up?\nSurrender means text areas, which means markdown wins by default, except in a way that you can’t market or leverage in any meaningful way.\nInstead, I’d like to split this issue into a number of smaller problems to tackle:\n\nOngoing interoperability. The ability to integrate other apps and tools into your note-taking workflow is vital to many.\nSporadic interoperability. Being able to export files to use in other contexts and apps.\nEase of use. Being able to take notes without learning a markup format.\nPower. Being able to accomplish your note-taking or writing goals.\n\nThe interoperability issues can be tackled, using markdown even, without forcing markdown as a writing tool.\nEase of use is, quite honestly, best served with a rich text editor. They’re tricky to do well but doable.\nPower, then, becomes the toughest nut to crack. I think that’s an interesting problem in its own right. You don’t need to resort to markdown to enable power user features in note-taking.\nSo, I have an angle on this I need to research and pursue, that doesn’t necessarily require me to build a markdown-oriented app.\nAn epilogue, of sorts\nFor most of my life, I had been an avid keyboard user. I hardly ever wrote anything out by hand and had notoriously illegible handwriting. But I had completely forgotten about my initial transition into plain text in the early days of my computing life.\nA few years ago, I decided to switch most of my note-taking to analogue. I decided to prioritise my own enjoyment of the note-taking experience over productivity or automation. I switched from being a mostly keyboard and plaintext note-taker to being an avid user of paper, fountain pens, notebooks, and index cards. I later added a whiteboard (now a chalkboard) into the mix.\nWhat I found out was that my productivity and understanding of what I was working on didn’t decrease at all. Instead, it increased with my enjoyment. This is what initially prompted me to expand my ongoing research focus from digital reading to annotation, note-taking and writing as well.\nOne of the reasons why I’ve spent so many years looking at digital reading was because I felt that many of the ideas from print-based reading have been lost in the transition. We have gotten many of the basics right with our digital reading interfaces. Typography and resolution are much improved, for example. But our apps and devices rarely go beyond those basics and it’s rare to see any meaningful variations in the reading app genre.\nMy fountain pens and index cards made me realise that note-taking, esp. when you include annotation, shares many of the same problems, both in implementation, the lack of variation from the basics, and the lossy translation from print. Most importantly, they all tend to lack a sense of joy.\nHence, Colophon Cards. It might not end up being revolutionary but hopefully, with enough work, it’ll add some polish to the note-taking app genre.\n(Next, what I learned about the various kinds of note-taking from talking to a bunch of people.)",

      "title": "How to keep up with web development without falling into despair",
      "summary": "\n—Everything keeps changing\n\n\n—I’m spread too thin trying to keep up\n\n\n—I feel like I’ve lost control over my professional life\n\n\n—I’m starting to regret getting into web development\n\n\n—I’m tired of constantly chasing new frameworks to make sure I don’t get replaced by an inexperienced college graduate\n\n\n—Whatever I try to do to keep up is never enough; the changes never stop coming\n\n\n\nYou’ve barely pushed a feature to production when you notice a new major release of a dependency.\nKeeping up with all of the changes in a single framework is next to impossible. Keeping up the framework’s ecosystem is impossible.\nSo. Many. New. Packages.\nSo. Many. New. Or. Changed. Standards.\nDozens of new blog posts or articles on how to do stuff appear every day\n\nI can’t keep up; you can’t keep up. Nobody can.\n—But I have to keep up! Otherwise, I won’t be able to do my job. Web Development is hell. Maybe I’ll just quit and do something else. Anything else.\n\nPeople say that web development is unique because of the fast pace and volume of changes in the field. And, since most of us have at least a tangential awareness of other fields through our friends and families (and, in my case, former fields of study), we know that web development seems unique in invoking this feeling of helplessness.\nIt is unique in overwhelming those of us who practise it, but it isn’t uniquely fast-paced.\nI’m not talking here about the difficulty of doing or learning the job.\nIt’s the task of keeping up with change and new developments in the field once you’re in it. In that regard, web dev isn’t unique.\nIf anything, compared to fields that still have active research going on (which isn’t the case for software or web dev) like medicine or biotech, the pace of change is arguably much, much lower in web dev.\nBut, this feeling of being spread too thin, of being unable to keep up, is real. Just not for the reason you think.\nSo, how do people in other fields keep up with changes in that field? Why is web dev so bad? And, how can we learn from other fields and try not to go mad racing the Red Queen?\n\n“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.”\n“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”\n\nFirst, I’ll tell you about the two approaches that work in other fields but won’t work in web dev because we actually do kind of suck. Pretending otherwise isn’t productive. Then I’ll end with the one approach that genuinely works. It requires work. But that work is still less effort than keeping up with the firehose of change.\n1. Other fields have collective or institutional filters\nThe first method is the one that’s the least useful to us because, as an industry, web dev does not invest in itself as a field. Training is the bare minimum needed to fill jobs. Conferences are mostly for networking. There is little to no active, original research into new approaches or ideas.\nBut other industries, esp. those who have been around for a while, have institutions and traditions. These provide practitioners with filters to help them stay up-to-date to industry goings-on.\nThey help you keep up with what’s broadly important, and they have journals and industry rags that help you keep up with what matters; which you then complement by following developments in your primary speciality.\nWe instead have aggregators that filter very little. Instead of helping us keep up, they become firehoses of content which makes the problem worse.\nA web dev equivalent, for example, would be a quarterly publication outlining all of the broadly important news in web dev.\n2. They specialise\nCardiologists don’t keep up with experimental Alzheimer’s treatments. Editors and agents in the publishing industry pick the genres they focus on and follow. A developmental linguist specialising in bilingual language acquisition in children isn’t going to be keeping up with the development of natural language processing software models in applied linguistics.\nPeople specialise. They don’t isolate themselves—they’ll still use information from other specialities—but they won’t regard keeping up with those specialities as a core part of their job.\nWeb dev is unique in how we’ve been trying to roll back the specialisation of the field with notions like Full Stack Web Devs. Fifteen years ago, it seemed obvious to many of us in the industry that the future would involve more specialisation.\nInstead, we went the other way and decided: “Hey! Let’s make everybody also code the servers! That’ll save money! Node and browsers are pretty much the same, right? Right?\"\nWe expect people to do the impossible: keep up with everything.\n—So, this is hopeless, right? Might as well quit and become an English teacher or something?\nThere’s one more thing that many fields do that web dev doesn’t. It’s a tactic we can copy as individuals without waiting for a broken industry to fix itself.\n3. They stop “Keeping Up” and instead do Research\nStudents generally start in “keep up” mode. They’re in a new environment like a university. They need to keep up with their coursework, reading, practice, and a new social life. It’s often tough to keep your head above the water. You can do this, as a student, for a few years, but it’s not sustainable for life. So, one of the tasks teachers have, esp. once the students reach the postgraduate stage, is to flick that switch in their minds from “keeping up” mode to “research” mode.\nInstead of keeping up with what everybody else is doing, research the task at hand. You let work guide you.\nHow, exactly, the research is done varies from field to field. Sometimes it’s overtly practice-led like in arts or media. Sometimes it’s directed by your speciality. A lot of the time it’s driven by your thesis question, followed by your research question later in life (Umberto Eco’s How to Write a Thesis explains this one well). The methods and practices vary but new people aren’t expected to just figure it out.\nThey aren’t expected to keep up with everything and then decide afterwards which bits of everything are related to their work (or not).\nThese fields spend a lot of effort teaching new entrants research methodology. Choosing your speciality or your question is generally regarded as a Pretty Damn Important Moment.\nWeb dev as a field doesn’t have a common research methodology or standard tactics for keeping up with change. That’s why we’re all overwhelmed. Not because it’s uniquely fast-paced but because it’s unique in how it doesn’t invest in people, training or methodology.\nWe don’t teach people to ask the right questions.\nThe strategy you need to apply is simple: you keep following your feeds, your social media, your subreddits, etc., but you now default to not reading any of it.\nYou only check out articles, podcasts, or videos that are directly relevant to your Work Questions. (More on that later.) Even then, you still don’t read, watch, or listen to them. You scan them above the fold and ask yourself:\nCan I defer reading this until I’m doing the task?\nIt’s useful to have a library of articles that you know are good references for tasks you may or may not need to do in the future. You don’t need to read any of them right away. Just get into practice at spotting them and filing them away.\nThere’s no point in religiously reading every blog post on accessible drag and drop in React, or state management with hooks, whenever these articles pop up in your feed. Bookmark them and use them as references when you’re doing that task.\nDoes this relate to one of my Work Questions?\nIf it doesn’t touch on one of your long-term goals and isn’t a reference you can use later on to guide you in a task, stop reading and close the tab.\nIf it’s important it’ll come across your feed again and again. Paradigm-shifting changes in web dev are rare (AJAX, jQuery, React, CSS Media Queries, CSS Grid, CSS Variables, ESM modules). When they do arrive they’ll become so loud and so prevalent in your web dev community that you’d have to work hard not to notice them. Even then, the transition usually takes years.\nPeople are still building projects that don’t use CSS Grid or Variables and bundle together CommonJS modules. Old methods keep on working.\nIf it does touch on a Work Question you generally need to do a first-pass read to decide how important it is?\nRead through it without looking up words or phrases you don’t understand and skip over the hard-to-parse sentences. The goal is to discover whether a deep read is worth the investment or not, so you don’t want to spend too much time on this read.\nSometimes you find articles that don’t add anything to what you know—don’t materially affect the Question—but are still useful references to have, esp. if you need to convey an idea or method to other people, like your colleagues.\nSometimes you’ll find that the article is worth a deep read. You either put in the time right away and give it a deeper re-read, or you file it away to study later.\nFor example, one of my Work Questions is “How can I make a web UI that doesn’t feel flat but also isn’t a skeuomorphic cartoon pastiche of real-world objects?”. Anything that touches on filters, gradients, or texture effects in CSS will catch my interest. When Ahmad Shadeed’s article on radial and conic gradients came across my feed I scanned it to make sure it was relevant. Then I filed it away for re-read later (which, to be fair, just involved opening as a tab in the browser window that holds research related to current work). After re-reading, I bookmarked it properly so that I could refer to it later when I’m using gradient effects.\nIf it doesn’t relate to a Work Question and isn’t a how-to reference for a future task, ignore it and move on\nReally. I don’t need to follow the ins and outs of React state management. You don’t need to know about the state of modern JS support in XHTML. You should be ignoring most of the goings-on in the web development community.\nHow do we choose our Work Questions?\nNow we get to the tricky part. The good news is that you don’t need to figure this out in one go. You can start with many vague questions and, as you do your research, you either cross them off or rephrase them to become more specific.\nThey are supposed to change over time. Some of them should be dictated by your current tasks. Others can be more aspirational: ask questions related to the work you want to be doing.\nFor example, here are the questions that guide my web dev research when it comes to my Colophon Cards project:\n\nHow do you provide a lightweight yet nicely interactive front end? Anything that comes across my feed that’s about doing more with less—smaller bundle sizes, fewer dependencies, faster loading, etc.—on the front end piques my interest as a possible answer.\nHow can I better manage the project’s CSS? Continue to use bundling? Continue to use CUBE? How do the approaches from Every Layout work in this context?\nAs I wrote above: How can I make a web UI that doesn’t feel flat but also isn’t a skeuomorphic cartoon pastiche of real-world objects? I think UX generally suffers in flat UI design as it doesn’t leverage layering, affordances, and metaphors to the degree that it could. I’m very curious about breaking out of flatland.\nCan I integrate accessibility features into UX designs as obvious-yet-attractive affordances instead of constantly being hidden from view? Wabi-sabi used to be a common reference in web design circles. An example of this would be to make focus styles overt and obvious. But in an aesthetically pleasing way.\nHow can we make browser-based reading more powerful, more useful, and more accessible than other forms of reading?\nIs it possible to make Multi-Page Apps as engaging and ‘snazzy’ as Single-Page-Apps?\nWhat are the simplest kinds of state management tactics that’ll work for a web app? Esp. in a vanilla JS or web component-based app.\nIs it possible to build this kind of app using only serverless-style services without having to geta PhD in AWS and CloudFormation?\nWhat are the best ways to implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for a vanilla JS or web components app?\nSVG WTF? Just, SVG. WTF? I need to understand SVG better.\n\nYou’ll note that these questions range from the high level to the low level. Some of them focus on practical details of a specific technology. Others are more ‘chewable’. Some of them are specific and will eventually have a clear answer. Others are open-ended and represent the ongoing development of a work philosophy or outlook.\nThe questions change with the job. When I’ve had projects that involve PDF-rendering in the browser, then that (“What’s the best way to render a PDF in a browser?\") became one of my Work Questions. “How can CSS Grids help with my layouts?” was once a big question. But I dropped it once I felt I had a handle on it. I still rely on the reference articles I bookmarked when I was doing that research.\n\nI set aside about an hour or two a day for research.\nI sit down with a cup of coffee and go through my social media, my feed reader, and a couple of select online sources. I filter out articles and papers based on whether they touch on one of my questions or whether they look like a ‘how-to’ that I can file away.\nI rarely need to spend the entire two hours.

They stop &ldquo;Keeping Up&rdquo; and instead do Research</h2>\n<p>Students generally start in &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; mode. They&rsquo;re in a new environment like a university. They need to keep up with their coursework, reading, practice, and a new social life. It&rsquo;s often tough to keep your head above the water. You can do this, as a student, for a few years, but it&rsquo;s not sustainable for life. So, one of the tasks teachers have, esp. once the students reach the postgraduate stage, is to flick that switch in their minds from &ldquo;keeping up&rdquo; mode to &ldquo;research&rdquo; mode.</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping up with what everybody else is doing, research the task at hand. You let <em>work</em> guide you.</p>\n<p>How, exactly, the research is done varies from field to field. Sometimes it&rsquo;s overtly practice-led like in arts or media. Sometimes it&rsquo;s directed by your speciality. A lot of the time it&rsquo;s driven by your thesis question, followed by your research question later in life (<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/how-write-thesis\">Umberto Eco&rsquo;s <em>How to Write a Thesis</em></a> explains this one well). The methods and practices vary but new people aren&rsquo;t expected to just figure it out.</p>\n<p>They aren&rsquo;t expected to keep up with everything and then decide <em>afterwards</em> which bits of everything are related to their work (or not).</p>\n<p>These fields spend a <em>lot</em> of effort teaching new entrants research methodology. Choosing your speciality or your <em>question</em> is generally regarded as a Pretty Damn Important Moment.</p>\n<p>Web dev as a field doesn&rsquo;t have a common research methodology or standard tactics for keeping up with change. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> why we&rsquo;re all overwhelmed. Not because it&rsquo;s uniquely fast-paced but because it&rsquo;s unique in how it doesn&rsquo;t invest in people, training or methodology.</p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t teach people to ask the right questions.</p>\n<p>The strategy you need to apply is simple: you keep following your feeds, your social media, your subreddits, etc., but you now default to not reading any of it.</p>\n<p>You only check out articles, podcasts, or videos that are directly relevant to your Work Questions.

One driver of the evolution of the personal computer, laptops, mobile phones, and all forms of mobile computing has been the desire to increase their range: do more; in a smaller package. Many in tech and software are addicted to riding this wave of new capabilities, however long it will last, to work on and create new software. To extend the reach of the computers in our lives.\nInnovation’s the word. Pushing the boundaries. You know the phrases. Usually spouted by that dude at the party.\nThe other side is also interesting. We are now in a place where we have entire genres of software that have decades of history, are backed by stacks of new and old research, have dozens of successful, well-made exemplar apps, and a broad enough conceptual space to allow for new variations on the theme.\nIn short, we have genre software and we have avant-garde software, and I’ve always been more interested in genre fiction than literary fiction.\nOne of the earliest genres of software is the Personal Knowledge or Information Manager—arguably as old as the computer mouse itself. Managing data is one of the tasks computers have always been good at, so we’ve been making software in that genre for decades.\nOutliners, hypertext systems, note-taking apps, personal information databases—we’ve been doing this for a while and, because software is inherently ephemeral, we make new iterations for every generation.\nSometimes, such as with Tinderbox or DEVONThink, the new iterations are new versions of the original software. Sometimes, such as with Bear, Ulysses, Roam, or Obsidian, it’s a new take on the genre. Not so new that you don’t recognise it for it is, and not so innovative that it doesn’t reuse what worked for other apps, but new variations that are adapted to work well in our current computing context.\nThat isn’t even close to a comprehensive list. There’s also Evernote, Drafts, 1Writer—even Apple’s Notes app has evolved to become impressively useful. And I’m still only scratching the surface.\nThese apps are also extremely diverse. There’s an increasing tendency for software, in this age of ‘flat’, to all look the same. Same design. Same aesthetic. Same icons. Same fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) concept mapped onto a specific problem domain. But you’d never mistake a screenshot of Bear for one of Tinderbox or Ulysses. You’d never look at Roam and think to yourself: “huh? That looks exactly like DEVONThink.”\nI’ve been working in or adjacent to this space for the past five years, with varying degrees of success and you can probably tell that I’m a little bit obsessed with the genre.\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that I’m working on my contribution to the genre.\nI’ve wanted to build a specific take on the note-oriented personal information manager for myself for a long time.\nThis summer I applied for a grant from the Technology Development Fund at The Icelandic Centre for Research to create a prototype of a notetaking app that I’m calling…\nColophon Cards\nWhile the app itself won’t be open source (though some bits of it might be), I’ve gotten used to following the open-source ethos of working publicly and transparently.\nSo, over the next six months (or longer if I’m successful) I’m going to be documenting the process, the design, development, research, marketing, discussion with my advisers, and other details, at colophon.cards.\nAs you can probably tell from the site, I began a few days ago.\n\nThe front page is the first version of the pitch for the app and my specific approach.\nThe first design notes are a high-level sketch of how it should work.\nThe data model are my first attempt at structuring it.\nThe sharing model outlines how I envision collaboration to work.\nAttachments and bookmarks are about how information management works. I like this one so much that I edited it into the front page pitch, as I’m sure you can tell.\nReading and viewing outlines my take on what’s missing in the field in terms of reading features in knowledge management apps.\nThe business model is a rough sketch of what I imagine the business model to be. Not because I’m anywhere near launching this but because you can’t design an app without having a sense of its business model and its margins.\nThe questions that need to be answered are just that. Open questions that I need to find answers to.\n\nAdditionally, you can follow my work on the website and comment with an issue on the GitHub repository. (Work on the software itself will be in a private repository.)\nThe notes I’ve been posting are rough and unedited. They are work products, not essays or marketing, those belong here on this site. You can follow Colophon Cards news by following the mailing list using the form on the site (this is a separate mailing list from the one on this site), by following its feed, or by watching the GitHub repository.\nI’ll also make sure to post about major updates here on this site.\nI’m enjoying the process a lot and I hope that you’ll enjoy it with me.",

      "content_text": "There are tasks that computers are good at. And there are tasks where they aren’t. One driver of the evolution of the personal computer, laptops, mobile phones, and all forms of mobile computing has been the desire to increase their range: do more; in a smaller package. Many in tech and software are addicted to riding this wave of new capabilities, however long it will last, to work on and create new software. To extend the reach of the computers in our lives.\nInnovation’s the word. Pushing the boundaries. You know the phrases. Usually spouted by that dude at the party.\nThe other side is also interesting. We are now in a place where we have entire genres of software that have decades of history, are backed by stacks of new and old research, have dozens of successful, well-made exemplar apps, and a broad enough conceptual space to allow for new variations on the theme.\nIn short, we have genre software and we have avant-garde software, and I’ve always been more interested in genre fiction than literary fiction.\nOne of the earliest genres of software is the Personal Knowledge or Information Manager—arguably as old as the computer mouse itself. Managing data is one of the tasks computers have always been good at, so we’ve been making software in that genre for decades.\nOutliners, hypertext systems, note-taking apps, personal information databases—we’ve been doing this for a while and, because software is inherently ephemeral, we make new iterations for every generation.\nSometimes, such as with Tinderbox or DEVONThink, the new iterations are new versions of the original software. Sometimes, such as with Bear, Ulysses, Roam, or Obsidian, it’s a new take on the genre. Not so new that you don’t recognise it for it is, and not so innovative that it doesn’t reuse what worked for other apps, but new variations that are adapted to work well in our current computing context.\nThat isn’t even close to a comprehensive list. There’s also Evernote, Drafts, 1Writer—even Apple’s Notes app has evolved to become impressively useful. And I’m still only scratching the surface.\nThese apps are also extremely diverse. There’s an increasing tendency for software, in this age of ‘flat’, to all look the same. Same design. Same aesthetic. Same icons. Same fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) concept mapped onto a specific problem domain. But you’d never mistake a screenshot of Bear for one of Tinderbox or Ulysses. You’d never look at Roam and think to yourself: “huh? That looks exactly like DEVONThink.”\nI’ve been working in or adjacent to this space for the past five years, with varying degrees of success and you can probably tell that I’m a little bit obsessed with the genre.\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that I’m working on my contribution to the genre.\nI’ve wanted to build a specific take on the note-oriented personal information manager for myself for a long time.\nThis summer I applied for a grant from the Technology Development Fund at The Icelandic Centre for Research to create a prototype of a notetaking app that I’m calling…\nColophon Cards\nWhile the app itself won’t be open source (though some bits of it might be), I’ve gotten used to following the open-source ethos of working publicly and transparently.\nSo, over the next six months (or longer if I’m successful) I’m going to be documenting the process, the design, development, research, marketing, discussion with my advisers, and other details, at colophon.cards.\nAs you can probably tell from the site, I began a few days ago.\n\nThe front page is the first version of the pitch for the app and my specific approach.\nThe first design notes are a high-level sketch of how it should work.\nThe data model are my first attempt at structuring it.\nThe sharing model outlines how I envision collaboration to work.\nAttachments and bookmarks are about how information management works.

      "summary": "For the first time in my life, I felt the urge to comment on Reddit.\nOver on r/webdev, this here question popped up:\n\nDo you think reading css articles like css-tricks & smashing magazine is waste of time?\n\nThis question isn’t really about the two sites mentioned but about the frustration we all feel with the endless treadmill of keeping up with what’s happening in web dev. Especially, since a lot of it feels so unproductive:\n\nArticles on features that haven’t shipped yet and may never ship everywhere.\nAdvanced features that address specialised use cases you’re never going to encounter.\nMasturbatory “let’s do this without any JS!” articles that end up being much more complicated than adding, like, a line or two of JS.\n\nIt’s a lot. It’s frustrating. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Which is the reason why I felt the urge to reply with the following. Hopefully others will find it helpful.\n\nSo, I’ve been making websites since before CSS was a thing and using CSS since before absolute positioning was a thing which I guess makes me … intermediate? Maybe? 😄\nYou don’t have to keep running the gossip treadmill to keep up. This applies to CSS, JS, HTML and the rest. As you observe, memorising partially implemented new standards, many of which may not even end up adopted as actual standards, isn’t a productive use of anybody’s time.\nTreat it like you would a gossip column covering people in your field: read it for fun, don’t over-invest, don’t feel bad about missing out on it. There’s a lot of gossip out there so there’s a lot to ignore.\nWhat I’ve found does pay off is focusing on doing different kinds of reading:\nThere’s the aforementioned gossip—new news so new that it may not ever be useful. You don’t want to spend much time on web dev gossip in general (JS dev news is often even more gossipy).\nThen you have the more detailed how-tos, some of which may be covering recent-ish standards, but are mostly about features you can use right away. Ahmad Shadeed’s blog has many good examples of this which I highly recommend. You read these texts to get a sense of what the platform can do. You don’t need to memorise how it is done. Just know that it can be done.\nThen you have problem analysis and solutions. These posts go over specific problems and how you might solve them. Josh W Comeau’s blog is full of these kinds of posts. Sara Soueidan’s blog is also a good source. Lea Verou’s as well. Smashing Magazine and CSS-Tricks have a lot of these kinds of posts as well, so I would have another look at them if I were you. You were reading them as industry gossip (which they do provide) but it sounds like you weren’t getting the full value that these sites have to offer in terms of howtos and problem solutions.\nThese sites you read—scan mostly—and you bookmark individual posts that you find interesting so that you can refer to them later if you run into the problem they’ve solved yourself. (Which reminds me: I recommend using a bookmarking service so you can find your bookmarks even when you aren’t logged into your preferred browser.)\nAnother important type of reading is higher level or workflow level analysis. Such as the CUBE CSS site. Reading about how to organise your work is some of the most productive learning you can do. Every Layout is another example as it’s fundamentally about how you optimally structure your CSS for composition and reuse. These you read, study, and reread. You don’t have to agree with everything they say, but you should be able to answer (for yourself) why you would disagree with them.\nFinally, there’s synthesis. That’s when you start to read texts that are adjacent to your work so that you become better at addressing those problems on your end. For those, you would be reading blogs on accessibility (like Adrian Roselli’s) or design (like Stephanie Walter’s) or the link blog of a web developer who is also doing cross-discipline synthesis reading (like Jeremy Keith’s, which I highly recommend.)\nYou don’t have to understand everything on all of the sites in this last bucket. Those are more for building a shared vocabulary and mindset with other specialities that you will be working with.\nOf course, checking these sites every day is a huge pain, especially since most of them aren’t updated every day. This is why a feed reader, such as Feedly, is gold. You can’t trust that new posts to these sites will pop up on the aggregation sites you follow.\nA rule of thumb is that the importance of a blog in your feed reader is inversely proportional to their posting cadence. Prioritise the blogs that post only once a month or every couple of weeks over those that post every day or multiple times a day. You don’t want to miss a new Ahmad Shadeed post but there’s no harm in skipping the CSS-Tricks firehose for a few days. Building up a large library of sporadically updated blogs is much more useful and much easier to keep up with than trying to keep up with a handful of aggregation sites every day.\nThe benefit to this approach is that it isn’t time-sensitive. If you look at the posting cadence of the core blogs I mentioned, you can go away for half a year and they won’t have that many new posts for you to catch up on. 99% of the rest that has piled up while you were away is just gossip that you can ‘mark as read’ without any guilt.\nSo, to answer your question: yes, you should still be reading these sites, but you should change how you read them and add a few others into the mix. 🙂",

It would have been some time after 1995 when I was 18 and had recently spent the money I&amp;rsquo;d earned on my part-time job on a down payment for a Mac Performa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(I was paying for that computer for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; afterwards.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That computer was an upgrade from my old &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE&#34;&gt;Mac SE&lt;/a&gt; and in many ways, a major improvement:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Colour! Thousands of them, even. So nice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Multi-tasking. Also great. More than one app running at a time? Sign me up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More storage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An option for a built-in modem. Hello, Internet!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But, and this is where the story begins to sound familiar to modern Mac users, the software was a different story. However, this time the fault wasn&amp;rsquo;t with Apple but with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My go-to application on the SE (commonly nicknamed the &amp;ldquo;kýrauga&amp;rdquo; in Icelandic, literally &amp;ldquo;porthole&amp;rdquo;) was Microsoft Word. Anything I typed I typed in Word. A small black and white screen, Word 5.1, and a mechanical keyboard made for a surprisingly good writing environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the upgrade came a transition to Word 6.0, courtesy of &amp;lsquo;borrowed&amp;rsquo; install disks from my mom&amp;rsquo;s office, and I was not happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The performance and UX disaster that was &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040514091238/http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx&#34;&gt;Word for Mac 6.0 is well-documented elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a textbook case by now. This meant that I began to use Word less and less for personal writing and relied on it primarily for writing for school.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always written and have always used computers for writing. I began by usign WordPerfect for DOS when I was ten years old. Switched to Word on the SE. And when Word disappointed on the Performa I began to search for alternatives. I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleWorks&#34;&gt;ClarisWorks&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Even tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisus_Writer&#34;&gt;Nisus Writer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you might guess, all this switching meant that file format compatibility became a bit of an issue. And given that most of this was just notes and other personal writing, I eventually settled on plain text and BBedit Lite and have since then mostly stuck to plain text as my primary format for taking digital notes. My use of plain text predates my use of markdown and other markup formats (including HTML).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For work, I&amp;rsquo;ve always just used what I had to: Word, Google Docs, Pages, whatever. But for myself? Plain text.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-user-interviews&#34;&gt;The User Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten about all of this when I was preparing for the user research interviews I had set up for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colophon.cards/&#34;&gt;Colophon Cards&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The interviews were a follow-up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colophon.cards/notes/survey-results/&#34;&gt;the survey I had conducted a few weeks earlier&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted some more context on the data from the survey and to get some feedback on the initial paper prototype of the main view (implemented in HTML, natch). I got around a dozen people volunteering for an interview, which I split into two cohorts:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For the first, I focused on the various kinds of note-taking they were juggling in their lives: collaborative work, individual work, personal, household, hobby, etc. Followed by a short test of the initial paper prototype.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With the second cohort, I tried to dig more into how the various parallel note-taking processes that people used worked together. Were the analogue notes ever moved into digital? Was there a flow between the collaborative notes for work and the individual work notes? Followed by a short test of a new iteration of the paper/HTML prototype.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of study you do to get conclusive actionable data. Too few participants; too unstructured; a self-selected group of expert users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That last part is an especially big issue for studies like these. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to recruit subjects who have a deep interest in the subject matter, so you tend to end up with a higher proportion of expert users than would be representative of your actual user base. And that was certainly the case here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These sorts of interviews can be a good source for leads and ideas, though. I view these results more as a starting point for further testing and research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted some context for some of the bigger questions I had after the survey. One of them was on formats and lock-in. Quite a few of the respondents looked like habitual app switchers and I wanted to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My motivation was quite self-serving:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People who switch are more likely to give a new app a chance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you know what problem causes people to switch, you can address it before it happens.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-why-did-switchers-switch&#34;&gt;So, Why Did Switchers Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of it is, frankly, down to trauma. Everybody who has used computers for more than a few years has had at least one experience akin to &amp;ldquo;Word for Mac 6.0.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apps that got steadily worse with each update.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;UX degradation as features pile up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apps that were abandoned or even shut down as businesses&#39; priorities changed or companies went bankrupt.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having to switch OSes for some reason and discovering that an app didn&amp;rsquo;t support their new platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The switch for most wasn&amp;rsquo;t to markdown or a markdown app. They switched to plain text because that format works everywhere with everything. They weren&amp;rsquo;t switching to markdown specifically. Plain text lets you mix and match apps depending on the platform. You aren&amp;rsquo;t locked into the same app on desktop and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is where expert user bias is important. These respondents were your ideal markdown user: technically competent, curious, and familiar with markup as a concept. They all know markdown and many of them use it regularly. But none of the benefits they described were those of markdown. They weren&amp;rsquo;t publishing these notes. They weren&amp;rsquo;t converting their notes to HTML or printing them. What they wanted was the portability and interoperability of plain text. Markdown just made plain text more usable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If expert users aren&amp;rsquo;t using markdown for markdown&amp;rsquo;s sake, what are the chances that a non-expert markdown user is motivated to use it out of genuine interest in a markup format?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-markdown-or-not-to-markdown&#34;&gt;To markdown or not to markdown?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A question that has been rattling around in my head from the start of this project&amp;mdash;actually, from the start of my projects at Rebus a few years ago&amp;mdash;was whether the writing widgets in the apps I work on should be based on rich text or on markdown?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Markdown has a number of obvious flaws. It starts off simple for most users but its mid-level or advanced features are surprisingly hard to master. Many find it quite difficult, for example, to remember what kind of bracket to use and where. Which comes first in a markdown link, the square brackets or the regular ones? Personally, I can&amp;rsquo;t, for the life of me, remember how the image markup works. I usually end up embedding an HTML image element. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to start with markdown tables. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging with markdown for almost &lt;em&gt;two decades&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HTML markup tends to be clearer for many elements, easier to write and read, and less ambiguous. Images, tables, and even links tend to be more straightforward in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s uglier, sure. HTML source code isn&amp;rsquo;t noted for its typographic aesthetics. But clarity and consistency go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A bigger issue is that HTML and markdown have drifted apart. Markdown doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a standard way to markup figure elements. The methods for generating an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute, important for cross-referencing, are also non-standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But these issues generally don&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re writing for yourself and don&amp;rsquo;t plan on converting the text into HTML or PDF. In those cases, the primary value is the non-proprietary nature of plaintext and the features that markdown provides are just gravy on top. What matters in that context is that non-expert users aren&amp;rsquo;t likely to be even aware of markdown&amp;rsquo;s features or even markdown&amp;rsquo;s existence in the first place. The risk is that you have a bunch of users for whom markdown&amp;rsquo;s learning curve is so steep that it looks like a wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;rich-text-then&#34;&gt;Rich text then?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of many of the current trends in rich text editing either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Block-based editors generally started off utterly dysfunctional because they were, for the most part, flawed conceptually. (Any rich text editor that doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you select text across blocks is not fit for purpose.) The only way to &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; most of them has been for them to lose more and more of their unique characteristics. Now, &amp;lsquo;block-based&amp;rsquo; has devolved into a marketing term as most of these editors are indistinguishable from their non-block-based counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rich text editors today also tend to rely on margin or command menu buttons that are so over-loaded that they make even the most cluttered and ambitious hamburger menu look as clear and straightforward as that of MacPaint in my old SE all those decades ago. Most of them are UX messes overloaded with features.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The minimalist rich text editors, on the other hand, tend to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; minimal. They either rely heavily on hover state for revealing UI elements or just literally expect you to know markdown to activate many of their formatting features. The few that do neither tend to be too spartan and support little beyond basic inline formatting, a couple of heading levels, and image embeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rich text widgets are also notoriously hard to implement properly (usably and accessibly) on the web. They&amp;rsquo;re extremely easy to get wrong, esp. if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to roll your own. (Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.) And if you reuse an existing widget, you tend to inherit whichever garbage UX trend was popular when that widget was first implemented. Markdown, by contrast, just needs a text area. It can benefit from more but doesn&amp;rsquo;t require it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rich-text widgets also raise the spectre of interoperability. People use plaintext for a reason, which is that it works everywhere, with everything, and is readable even in apps that don&amp;rsquo;t support markdown or other markup formats specifically. You could store the output of a rich text editor as HTML, which has many of the same interoperability benefits as markdown as it&amp;rsquo;s also a markup format built on plain text. But markdown has one clear advantage over HTML, which is that most of its block-defining markup is either invisible or as-good-as invisible. Paragraphs are defined by new lines. Lists are defined by looking like lists. Even headings are conceptually simple. Even if you had to use HTML for everything else, these block-level features on their own add tremendously to markdown&amp;rsquo;s usability as a plain text format.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This might not be an issue if you&amp;rsquo;re just using HTML for interoperability but might become an issue for users who need to edit it by hand for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You could use markdown as your editor interchange format but then markdown&amp;rsquo;s multiple flavours and drift from HTML becomes an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-just-give-up&#34;&gt;So, what? Just give up?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surrender means text areas, which means markdown wins by default, except in a way that you can&amp;rsquo;t market or leverage in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;rsquo;d like to split this issue into a number of smaller problems to tackle:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ongoing interoperability. The ability to integrate other apps and tools into your note-taking workflow is vital to many.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sporadic interoperability. Being able to export files to use in other contexts and apps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ease of use. Being able to take notes without learning a markup format.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Power. Being able to accomplish your note-taking or writing goals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The interoperability issues can be tackled, using markdown even, without forcing markdown as a writing tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ease of use is, quite honestly, best served with a rich text editor. They&amp;rsquo;re tricky to do well but doable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Power, then, becomes the toughest nut to crack. I think that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting problem in its own right. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to resort to markdown to enable power user features in note-taking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, I have an angle on this I need to research and pursue, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily require me to build a markdown-oriented app.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-epilogue-of-sorts&#34;&gt;An epilogue, of sorts&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For most of my life, I had been an avid keyboard user. I hardly ever wrote anything out by hand and had notoriously illegible handwriting. But I had completely forgotten about my initial transition into plain text in the early days of my computing life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I decided to switch most of my note-taking to analogue. I decided to prioritise my own enjoyment of the note-taking experience over productivity or automation. I switched from being a mostly keyboard and plaintext note-taker to being an avid user of paper, fountain pens, notebooks, and index cards. I later added a whiteboard (now a chalkboard) into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I found out was that my productivity and understanding of what I was working on didn&amp;rsquo;t decrease at all. Instead, it increased with my enjoyment. This is what initially prompted me to expand my ongoing research focus from digital reading to annotation, note-taking and writing as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I&amp;rsquo;ve spent so many years looking at digital reading was because I felt that many of the ideas from print-based reading have been lost in the transition. We have gotten many of the basics right with our digital reading interfaces. Typography and resolution are much improved, for example. But our apps and devices rarely go beyond those basics and it&amp;rsquo;s rare to see any meaningful variations in the reading app genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My fountain pens and index cards made me realise that note-taking, esp. when you include annotation, shares many of the same problems, both in implementation, the lack of variation from the basics, and the lossy translation from print. Most importantly, they all tend to lack a sense of joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hence, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colophon.cards/&#34;&gt;Colophon Cards&lt;/a&gt;. It might not end up being revolutionary but hopefully, with enough work, it&amp;rsquo;ll add some polish to the note-taking app genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Next, what I learned about the various kinds of note-taking from talking to a bunch of people.)&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n    </item>\n    \n    <item>\n      <title>The Colophon Cards User Survey</title>\n      <link>https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/colophon-cards-user-survey/</link>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 12:56:06 +0000</pubDate>\n      \n      <guid>https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/colophon-cards-user-survey/</guid>\n      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/images/survey-todo-pic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A small notebook with the word &#39;todo&#39; on the front, surrounded by post-its and other notetaking items&#34;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I need your help to create a user-friendly web app for note-taking!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notes, notebooks, stickies&amp;mdash;physical or digital&amp;mdash;have become a big part of our professional and personal lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether we&amp;rsquo;re using Apple&amp;rsquo;s built-in Notes app, a physical notebook or deck of index cards, or something more involved like Notion or Roam, most of us have tools that we use to make notes—ephemeral or permanent—to help us organise our lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/&#34;&gt;Baldur Bjarnason&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in web development, digital publishing, and digital reading for over twenty years. I&amp;rsquo;m working on a prototype for a note-taking web app called Colophon Cards&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(You can follow my progress on the project over at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colophon.cards&#34;&gt;Colophon Cards&lt;/a&gt; website.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My Colophon Cards project is an effort to build a note-taking tool that stakes out the otherwise sparsely populated middle ground in the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) space:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As straightforward to use as is sensible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A bit more visually oriented than the high-end apps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have the hypertextual or organisational features from the high-end that don&amp;rsquo;t make the app too complicated to use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have at least basic support for our digital reading needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, I need your help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I need to know what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are doing—how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; take notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would also need to know how some of my in-progress ideas and designs work for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first step towards this is a short survey you can take to help me see the lay of the note-taking land. It should only take you about five minutes to finish. More importantly, it ends with a question where you can volunteer to be a tester for the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which I would find very helpful 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share a link to this post or the survey with anybody you think might be interested in this space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/3L7FdGK&#34;&gt;Colophon Cards: Note-taking User Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Funded by The Icelandic Centre for Research&amp;rsquo;s Technology Development Fund &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</description>\n    </item>\n    \n    <item>\n      <title>How to keep up with web development without falling into despair</title>\n      <link>https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/i-cant-keep-up-with-web-dev/</link>\n      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 12:56:06 +0000</pubDate>\n      \n      <guid>https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/i-cant-keep-up-with-web-dev/</guid>\n      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Everything keeps changing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m spread too thin trying to keep up&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve lost control over my professional life&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m starting to regret getting into web development&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m tired of constantly chasing new frameworks to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t get replaced by an inexperienced college graduate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Whatever I try to do to keep up is never enough; the changes never stop coming&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve barely pushed a feature to production when you notice a new major release of a dependency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with all of the changes in a single framework is next to impossible. Keeping up the framework&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem is impossible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;So. Many. New. Packages.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;So. Many. New. Or. Changed. Standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dozens of new blog posts or articles on how to do stuff appear every day&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t keep up; you can&amp;rsquo;t keep up. Nobody can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;But I have to keep up! Otherwise, I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do my job. Web Development is hell. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just quit and do something else. Anything else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People say that web development is unique because of the fast pace and volume of changes in the field. And, since most of us have at least a tangential awareness of other fields through our friends and families (and, in my case, former fields of study), we know that web development seems unique in invoking this feeling of &lt;em&gt;helplessness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is unique in overwhelming those of us who practise it, but it &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; uniquely fast-paced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not talking here about the difficulty of doing or learning the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the task of keeping up with change and new developments in the field once you&amp;rsquo;re in it. In that regard, web dev isn&amp;rsquo;t unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If anything, compared to fields that still have active research going on (which isn&amp;rsquo;t the case for software or web dev) like medicine or biotech, the pace of change is arguably much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; lower in web dev.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But, this feeling of being spread too thin, of being unable to keep up, is real. Just not for the reason you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, how do people in other fields keep up with changes in that field? Why is web dev so bad? And, how can we learn from other fields and try not to go mad &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_race&#34;&gt;racing the Red Queen&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, in our country,&amp;rdquo; said Alice, still panting a little, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;d generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A slow sort of country!&amp;rdquo; said the Queen. &amp;ldquo;Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the two approaches that work in other fields but &lt;em&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; work in web dev because we actually do kind of suck. Pretending otherwise isn&amp;rsquo;t productive. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll end with the one approach that genuinely works. It requires work. But that work is still less effort than keeping up with the firehose of change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-other-fields-have-collective-or-institutional-filters&#34;&gt;1. Other fields have collective or institutional filters&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first method is the one that&amp;rsquo;s the least useful to us because, as an industry, web dev does not invest in itself as a &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt;. Training is the bare minimum needed to fill jobs. Conferences are mostly for networking. There is little to no active, original research into new approaches or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But other industries, esp. those who have been around for a while, have institutions and traditions. These provide practitioners with filters to help them stay up-to-date to industry goings-on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They help you keep up with what&amp;rsquo;s broadly important, and they have journals and industry rags that help you keep up with what matters; which you then complement by following developments in your primary speciality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We instead have aggregators that filter very little. Instead of helping us keep up, they become firehoses of content which makes the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A web dev equivalent, for example, would be a quarterly publication outlining all of the broadly important news in web dev.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-they-specialise&#34;&gt;2. They specialise&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists don&amp;rsquo;t keep up with experimental Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s treatments. Editors and agents in the publishing industry pick the genres they focus on and follow. A developmental linguist specialising in bilingual language acquisition in children isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be keeping up with the development of natural language processing software models in applied linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People specialise. They don&amp;rsquo;t isolate themselves&amp;mdash;they&amp;rsquo;ll still use information from other specialities&amp;mdash;but they won&amp;rsquo;t regard keeping up with those specialities as a core part of their job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Web dev is unique in how we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to roll back the specialisation of the field with notions like Full Stack Web Devs. Fifteen years ago, it seemed obvious to many of us in the industry that the future would involve more specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we went the other way and decided: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey! Let&amp;rsquo;s make everybody &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; code the servers! That&amp;rsquo;ll save money! Node and browsers are pretty much the same, right? Right?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We expect people to do the impossible: keep up with everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;So, this is hopeless, right? Might as well quit and become an English teacher or something?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one more thing that many fields do that web dev doesn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s a tactic we can copy as individuals without waiting for a broken industry to fix itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-they-stop-keeping-up-and-instead-do-research&#34;&gt;3. They stop &amp;ldquo;Keeping Up&amp;rdquo; and instead do Research&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Students generally start in &amp;ldquo;keep up&amp;rdquo; mode. They&amp;rsquo;re in a new environment like a university. They need to keep up with their coursework, reading, practice, and a new social life. It&amp;rsquo;s often tough to keep your head above the water. You can do this, as a student, for a few years, but it&amp;rsquo;s not sustainable for life. So, one of the tasks teachers have, esp. once the students reach the postgraduate stage, is to flick that switch in their minds from &amp;ldquo;keeping up&amp;rdquo; mode to &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of keeping up with what everybody else is doing, research the task at hand. You let &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; guide you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How, exactly, the research is done varies from field to field. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s overtly practice-led like in arts or media. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s directed by your speciality. A lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s driven by your thesis question, followed by your research question later in life (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/how-write-thesis&#34;&gt;Umberto Eco&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;How to Write a Thesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains this one well). The methods and practices vary but new people aren&amp;rsquo;t expected to just figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;rsquo;t expected to keep up with everything and then decide &lt;em&gt;afterwards&lt;/em&gt; which bits of everything are related to their work (or not).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These fields spend a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of effort teaching new entrants research methodology. Choosing your speciality or your &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; is generally regarded as a Pretty Damn Important Moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Web dev as a field doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a common research methodology or standard tactics for keeping up with change. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; why we&amp;rsquo;re all overwhelmed. Not because it&amp;rsquo;s uniquely fast-paced but because it&amp;rsquo;s unique in how it doesn&amp;rsquo;t invest in people, training or methodology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t teach people to ask the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The strategy you need to apply is simple: you keep following your feeds, your social media, your subreddits, etc., but you now default to not reading any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You only check out articles, podcasts, or videos that are directly relevant to your Work Questions. (More on that later.) Even then, you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t read, watch, or listen to them. You scan them above the fold and ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;_can-i-defer-reading-this-until-im-doing-the-task_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I defer reading this until I&amp;rsquo;m doing the task?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a library of articles that you know are good references for tasks you may or may not need to do in the future. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to read any of them right away. Just get into practice at spotting them and filing them away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no point in religiously reading every blog post on accessible drag and drop in React, or state management with hooks, whenever these articles pop up in your feed. Bookmark them and use them as references &lt;em&gt;when you&amp;rsquo;re doing that task&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;_does-this-relate-to-one-of-my-work-questions_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does this relate to one of my Work Questions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch on one of your long-term goals and isn&amp;rsquo;t a reference you can use later on to guide you in a task, stop reading and close the tab.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s important it&amp;rsquo;ll come across your feed again and again. Paradigm-shifting changes in web dev are rare (AJAX, jQuery, React, CSS Media Queries, CSS Grid, CSS Variables, ESM modules). When they do arrive they&amp;rsquo;ll become so loud and so prevalent in your web dev community that you&amp;rsquo;d have to work hard &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to notice them. Even then, the transition usually takes years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People are still building projects that don&amp;rsquo;t use CSS Grid or Variables and bundle together CommonJS modules. Old methods keep on working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If it does touch on a Work Question you generally need to do a first-pass read to decide &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; important it is?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read through it without looking up words or phrases you don&amp;rsquo;t understand and skip over the hard-to-parse sentences. The goal is to discover whether a deep read is worth the investment or not, so you don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time on this read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you find articles that don&amp;rsquo;t add anything to what you know&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t materially affect the Question&amp;mdash;but are still useful references to have, esp. if you need to convey an idea or method to other people, like your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the article is worth a deep read. You either put in the time right away and give it a deeper re-read, or you file it away to study later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, one of my Work Questions is &amp;ldquo;How can I make a web UI that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel flat but also isn&amp;rsquo;t a skeuomorphic cartoon pastiche of real-world objects?&amp;rdquo;. Anything that touches on filters, gradients, or texture effects in CSS will catch my interest. When &lt;a href=&#34;https://ishadeed.com/&#34;&gt;Ahmad Shadeed&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/css-radial-conic-gradient/&#34;&gt;radial and conic gradients&lt;/a&gt; came across my feed I scanned it to make sure it was relevant. Then I filed it away for re-read later (which, to be fair, just involved opening as a tab in the browser window that holds research related to current work). After re-reading, I bookmarked it properly so that I could refer to it later when I&amp;rsquo;m using gradient effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-it-doesnt-relate-to-a-work-question-and-isnt-a-how-to-reference-for-a-future-task-ignore-it-and-move-on&#34;&gt;If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t relate to a Work Question and isn&amp;rsquo;t a how-to reference for a future task, ignore it and move on&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Really. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to follow the ins and outs of React state management. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know about the state of modern JS support in XHTML. You should be ignoring most of the goings-on in the web development community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-we-choose-our-work-questions&#34;&gt;How do we choose our Work Questions?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the tricky part. The good news is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to figure this out in one go. You can start with many vague questions and, as you do your research, you either cross them off or rephrase them to become more specific.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to change over time. Some of them should be dictated by your current tasks. Others can be more aspirational: ask questions related to the work you want to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, here are the questions that guide my web dev research when it comes to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colophon.cards/&#34;&gt;Colophon Cards&lt;/a&gt; project:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you provide a lightweight yet nicely interactive front end?&lt;/em&gt; Anything that comes across my feed that&amp;rsquo;s about doing more with less&amp;mdash;smaller bundle sizes, fewer dependencies, faster loading, etc.&amp;mdash;on the front end piques my interest as a possible answer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I better manage the project&amp;rsquo;s CSS?&lt;/em&gt; Continue to use bundling? Continue to use CUBE? How do the approaches from &lt;a href=&#34;https://every-layout.dev/&#34;&gt;Every Layout&lt;/a&gt; work in this context?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As I wrote above: &lt;em&gt;How can I make a web UI that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel flat but also isn&amp;rsquo;t a skeuomorphic cartoon pastiche of real-world objects?&lt;/em&gt; I think UX generally suffers in flat UI design as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t leverage layering, affordances, and metaphors to the degree that it could. I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about breaking out of flatland.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I integrate accessibility features into UX designs as obvious-yet-attractive affordances instead of constantly being hidden from view?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wabi-sabi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used to be a common reference in web design circles. An example of this would be to make focus styles overt and obvious. But in an aesthetically pleasing way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we make browser-based reading more powerful, more useful, and more accessible than other forms of reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to make Multi-Page Apps as engaging and &amp;lsquo;snazzy&amp;rsquo; as Single-Page-Apps?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the simplest kinds of state management tactics that&amp;rsquo;ll work for a web app?&lt;/em&gt; Esp. in a vanilla JS or web component-based app.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to build this kind of app using only serverless-style services without having to geta PhD in AWS and CloudFormation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the best ways to implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for a vanilla JS or web components app?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;SVG WTF?&lt;/em&gt; Just, SVG. WTF? I need to understand SVG better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll note that these questions range from the high level to the low level. Some of them focus on practical details of a specific technology. Others are more &amp;lsquo;chewable&amp;rsquo;. Some of them are specific and will eventually have a clear answer. Others are open-ended and represent the ongoing development of a work philosophy or outlook.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The questions change with the job. When I&amp;rsquo;ve had projects that involve PDF-rendering in the browser, then that (&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to render a PDF in a browser?&amp;quot;) became one of my Work Questions. &amp;ldquo;How can CSS Grids help with my layouts?&amp;rdquo; was once a big question. But I dropped it once I felt I had a handle on it. I still rely on the reference articles I bookmarked when I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; doing that research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I set aside about an hour or two a day for research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I sit down with a cup of coffee and go through my social media, my feed reader, and a couple of select online sources. I filter out articles and papers based on whether they touch on one of my questions or whether they look like a &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; that I can file away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I rarely need to spend the entire two hours. It isn&amp;rsquo;t unusual for me to go over all of my sources in about 30 minutes and come away with nothing relevant. That&amp;rsquo;s when I switch to &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; research and proactively look for sources and references related to the questions I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how &amp;ldquo;keeping up&amp;rdquo; stops being a chore and becomes an interest-driven research activity that feeds your enthusiasm instead of draining it.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n    </item>\n    \n  </channel>\n</rss>"
