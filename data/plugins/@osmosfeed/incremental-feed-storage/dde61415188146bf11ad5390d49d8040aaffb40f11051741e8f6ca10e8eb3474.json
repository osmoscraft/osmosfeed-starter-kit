However, the reality is that cable is both stronger than ever and poised for growth; the reasons why are instructive to not just tech industry observers, but to tech companies themselves.</p>\n<h4>The Creation of Cable</h4>\n<p>Robert J. Tarlton was 29 years old, married with a son, when he volunteered to fight in World War II; thanks to the fact he owned a shop in Lansford, Pennsylvania that sold radios, he ended up repairing them all across the European Theater, learning about not just reception but also transmission. After the war Tarlton re-opened his shop, when Motorola, one of his primary suppliers, came out with a new television.</p>\n<p>Tarlton was intrigued, but he had a geography problem; the nearest television station was in Philadelphia, 71 miles away; in the middle lie the Pocono Mountains, and mountains aren&#8217;t good for reception:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=640%2C519&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Lansford is separated from Philadelphia by the Pocono Mountains\" width=\"640\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8952\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=1024%2C830&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=768%2C622&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=778%2C630&amp;ssl=1 778w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>It turned out, though, that some people living in Summit Hill, the next community over, could get the Philadelphia broadcast signal; that&#8217;s where Tarlton sold his first television sets. Of course Tarlton couldn&#8217;t demonstrate this new-fangled contraption; his shop was in Lansford, not Summit Hill. However, it was <em>close</em> to Summit Hill: what if Tarlton could place an antenna further up the mountain in Summit Hill and run a cable to his shop? Tarlton explained in <a href=\"https://www.cablecenter.org/the-barco-library/the-hauser-oral-history-project/t-v-listings/robert-tarlton-penn-state-collection\">an interview in 1986</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Lansford is an elongated town. It&#8217;s about a mile and a half long and there are about eight parallel streets bisected with cross streets about every 500 feet. There are no curves; everything is all laid out in a nice symmetrical pattern. Our business place was about three streets from the edge of Summit Hill and Lansford sits on kind of a slope. The edge of Lansford inclines from about a thousand feet above sea level to about fifteen hundred feet above sea level in Summit Hill. So to get television into our store, my father and I put an antenna partly up the mountain. No, we didn&#8217;t go all the way up, but we put up an antenna, kind of a crude arrangement, and then from tree to tree we strung a twin lead that was used in those days as a transmission line. We ran this twin lead, crossed a few streets, and into our store. And we had television.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The basic twin lead was barely functional, but that didn&#8217;t stop everyone from demanding a television with a haphazard wire to their house; Tarlton realized that new coaxial cable amplifiers designed for a single property could be chained together, re-amplifying the signal so it could reach multiple properties. After getting all of the other electronics retailers on board — Tarlton knew that a clear signal would sell more TV sets, but that everyone needed to use the same system — the first commercial cable system was born, and it sold itself. Tarlton reflected:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  You didn&#8217;t have to advertise. You had to keep your door locked because the people were clamoring for service. They wanted cable service. You certainly didn&#8217;t have to advertise.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>People couldn&#8217;t get enough TV; Tarlton explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Cable is dependent upon advances in technology because people who originally saw one channel wanted to see the second channel, wanted to see the third, and after you had five, they wanted more. So it was a case of more begets more. At one time three channels seemed to be quite sufficient but when we added one more channel, it created a new interest in the cable system. People then had variety. They had alternatives. At one time later five channels seemed enough. As a matter of fact, a man who is often quoted, former FCC Commissioner Ken Cox, said that five channels was enough, and that&#8217;s quite a story in itself. The engineers were able to continually refine equipment to add more channels…All these technical advances‑‑continuing advances, automatic gain control, automatic temperature compensation, etc. have made cable what it is today.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the most important technological developments was satellite: now cable systems could get signals both more reliably and from far further away; this actually flipped geography on its head. Tarlton said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  At that time we went to the highest possible point to look to the transmitter. Today with satellites, we go to the lowest possible point because we don&#8217;t want the interference from other signals. So it is ironic that we have changed so much from what we used to do.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Within these snippets is everything that makes the cable business so compelling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cable is in high demand because it provides the means to get what customers most highly value.</li>\n<li>Cable works best both technologically and financially when it has a geographic monopoly.</li>\n<li>Cable creates demand for new supply; technological advances enable more supply, which creates more demand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s that last bit about satellites being better on lower ground that stands out to me, though: as long as you control the wires into people&#8217;s houses you can and should be pragmatic about everything else.</p>\n<h4>Cable&#8217;s Evolution</h4>\n<p>Tarlton would go on to work for a company called Jerrold Electronics, which pivoted its entire business to create equipment for cities that wanted to emulate Lansford&#8217;s system; Tarlton would lead the installation of cable systems across the United States, which for the first two decades of cable mostly retransmitted broadcast television.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned satellite, though, led to the creation of national TV stations, first HBO, and then WTCG, an independent television station in Atlanta, Georgia, owned by Ted Turner. Turner realized he could buy programming at local rates, but sell advertising at national rates via cable operators eager to feed their customers&#8217; hunger for more stations. Turner soon launched a cable only channel devoted to nothing but news; he called it the Cable News Network — CNN for short (WTCG would later be renamed TBS).</p>\n<p>Jerrold Electronics, meanwhile, spun off one of the cable systems it built in Tupelo, Mississippi to an entrepreneur named Ralph Roberts; Roberts proceeded to systematically buy up community cable systems across the country, moving the company&#8217;s headquarters to Philadelphia and renaming it to Comcast Corporation (Roberts would eventually hand the business off to his son, Brian). Consolidation in the provision of cable service proceeded in conjunction with consolidation in the production of content, an inevitable outcome of the virtuous cycle I noted above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cable companies acquired customers who wanted access to content</li>\n<li>Studios created content that customers demanded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more customers that a cable company served, the stronger their negotiating position with content providers; the more studios and types of content that a content provider controlled the stronger their negotiating position with cable providers. The end result were a few dominant cable providers (Comcast, Charter, Cox, Altice, Mediacom) and a few dominant content companies (Disney, Viacom, NBC Universal, Time Warner, Fox), tussling back-and-forth over a very profitable pie.</p>\n<p>Then came Netflix, and tech industry crowing about cord cutting.</p>\n<p>Netflix and other streaming services were obviously bad for television: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/\">they did the same job but in a completely different way</a>, leveraging the Internet to provide content on-demand, unconstrained by the linear nature of television that was a relic of cable&#8217;s origin with broadcast TV. Here, though, cable&#8217;s ownership of the wires was an effective hedge: the same wires that delivered linear TV delivered packet-based Internet content.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this didn&#8217;t simply mean that cable&#8217;s TV losses were made up for by Internet service: Internet service was much higher margin because companies like Comcast didn&#8217;t need to negotiate with a limited number of content providers; everything on the Internet was free. This has meant that the fortunes of cable companies has boomed over the last decade, even as cord-cutting has cut the cable TV business by about a third.</p>\n<p>Cable companies today, though, are yet another category down from their pandemic highs, thanks to fear that the broadband growth story is mostly over; fiber offers better performance, 5G opens the door to wireless in the home, and anyone who doesn&#8217;t have broadband now is probably never going to get it. I think, though, this underrates the strategic positioning of cable companies, and ignores the industry&#8217;s demonstrated ability to adapt to new strategic environments.</p>\n<h4>The Wireless Opportunity</h4>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204826704577074103860244794\">Wall Street Journal</a> in 2011:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Verizon Wireless will pay $3.6 billion to buy wireless spectrum licenses from a group of cable-television companies, bringing an end to their years-long flirtation with setting up its own cellphone service. The sellers—Comcast Time Warner Cable Inc. and Bright House Networks—acquired the spectrum in a government auction in 2006 and now will turn it over to the country&#8217;s biggest wireless carrier at more than a 50% markup. While cable companies have dabbled with wireless, the spectrum has largely sat around unused, prompting years of speculation about the industry&#8217;s intentions…</p>\n<p>  Under the deal, Verizon Wireless will be able to sell its service in the cable companies&#8217; stores. The carrier, in turn, will be able to sell the cable companies&#8217; broadband, video and voice services in its stores. Verizon&#8217;s FiOS service only reaches 14% of U.S. households, according to Bernstein Research. In four years&#8217; time, the cable companies will have the option to buy service on Verizon&#8217;s network on a wholesale basis and then resell it under their own brand.</p>\n<p>  The joint marketing arrangement &#8220;amounts to a partnership between formerly mortal enemies,&#8221; wrote Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in a research note.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moffett would later partner with Michael Nathanson to form their own independent research firm (called <a href=\"https://www.moffettnathanson.com/?Section=Media%20/Telecom\">MoffettNathanson</a>, natch); Moffett released an updated report last month that explained how that Verizon deal ended up playing out:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When Comcast and Time Warner Cable sold their AWS-1 spectrum to Verizon back in 2011, they believed at the time that they were walking away from ever becoming facilities-based wireless players. They therefore viewed it as imperative that the sale come with an MVNO agreement with Verizon to compensate for that forfeiture. They got precisely what they wanted, an MVNO contract with Verizon that was described at the time as &#8220;<em>perpetual and irrevocable</em>&#8220;…</p>\n<p>  It took another six years after that transaction before Comcast finally launched Xfinity Mobile in mid-2017. Charter [which merged with Time Warner Cable, acquiring the latter&#8217;s MVNO rights] followed suit a year later…in four short years, the Cable operators have become the fastest growing wireless providers in the country, accounting for nearly 30% of wireless industry net additions. Cable&#8217;s 7.7 million mobile lines represent ~2.5% of the U.S. mobile phone market (including prepaid and postpaid phones).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Moffett notes, this growth is particularly impressive given that most cable companies couldn&#8217;t feasibly offer family plans under the terms of the original deal, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-wireless-plan-faces-hurdle-1438299616\">which was negotiated before such a concept even existed</a>; the deal has been re-negotiated, though, and almost certainly to the cable companies&#8217; advantage: if Verizon is going to lose customers to an MVNO, it would surely prefer said MVNO be on their network; this means that the cable companies have negotiating leverage.</p>\n<p>What, though, makes the cable companies such effective MVNOs? One of the most interesting parts of Moffett&#8217;s note was proprietary data about the amount of data used by cellular subscribers; it turns out that cable MVNO customers are far more likely to consume data over WiFi, perhaps because of cable company out-of-home WiFi hot spots. This could become even more favorable in the future as cable companies build out Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) service, particularly in dense areas where cable companies have wires from which to hang CBRS transmitters. Moffett writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In a perfect world, Cable will offload traffic onto their own facilities where doing so is cheap (high density, high use locations) and leave to Verizon the burden of carrying traffic where doing so is/would be expensive. Because the MVNO agreement is &#8220;perpetual and irrevocable,&#8221; and is based on <em>average</em> prices (i.e., the same price everywhere, whether easy or hard to reach), Cable is presented with a perfect ROI arbitrage; they can take the high ROI parts of the network for themselves, and leave the low ROI parts of the network to their MVNO host… all without sacrificing <em>anything</em> with respect to their national coverage footprint.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>One can understand why Verizon gave the cable companies these rights in 2011; the phone company desperately needed spectrum, and besides, everyone knew that MVNOs could never be economically competitive with their wholesale providers, who were the ones that actually made the investments in the network.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing, though: cable companies had their own massive build-out, one that was both much older in its origins and, because it connected the house, actually carried more data. This was to the benefit of Verizon and other cellular providers, of course: a Verizon iPhone uses WiFi at home just as much as a Comcast iPhone does; here, though, it was cable that had internet economics on its side: there is no competitive harm in giving equal access to an abundant resource; it is cellular access that is scarce, which means that the cable companies&#8217; MVNO deal, in conjunction with their out-of-home Internet access options, gives them a meaningful advantage.</p>\n<h4>Customer Acquisition</h4>\n<p>Moffett spends less time on customer acquisition; anecdotally speaking, it&#8217;s clear that Charter&#8217;s Spectrum, which provides the cable service I consume (via the excellent <a href=\"https://getchannels.com/\">Channels</a> application), is pushing wireless service hard: phones are front-and-center in their stores, and Spectrum wireless commercials fill local inventory. Moreover, this is a well-trodden playbook: cable companies came to dominate the fixed line phone service business simply because it was easier to get your TV, Internet, and phone all in the same place (and of those, the most important was TV, and now Internet); it&#8217;s always easier to upsell an existing subscriber than it is to acquire a new one.</p>\n<p>Of course cable companies long handled customer acquisition for content creators — that was the cable bundle in a nutshell. What is interesting is how this customer acquisition capability is attractive to the companies undoing that bundle: Netflix, for example, put its service on Comcast&#8217;s set-top boxes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/5/12096380/comcast-to-let-netflix-onto-its-x1-platform-which-is-a-very-big-deal\">in 2016</a>, and made a deal for Comcast to sell its service <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-to-bundle-rival-netflix-in-plans-1523624402\">in 2018</a>. I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/netflixs-earnings-and-the-video-value-chain-the-conditions-of-aggregation-comcast-and-netflix-and-the-new-bundle/\">a Daily Update</a> at the time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Netflix, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/netflix-goes-global-iphone-worry/\">laddering up</a> again: the company doesn&#8217;t actually need a billing relationship with end users, it just needs ever more end users (along with the data about what they watch) to spread its fixed content costs more widely; the company said in its <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.com/static-files/419958ac-5fd7-4bcd-9fb1-ebca445a9016\">shareholder letter</a> that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    These relationships allow our partners to attract more customers and to upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while we benefit from more reach, awareness and often, less friction in the signup and payment process. We believe that the lower churn in these bundles offsets the lower Netflix ASP.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  What is particularly interesting is that this arrangement moves the industry closer to the endgame I predicted in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/\">The Great Unbundling</a>…\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Endgame&#8221; was a bit strong: that Article was, as the title says, about unbundling; one of my arguments was that the traditional cable TV bundle would become primarily anchored on live sports and news, while most scripted content went to streaming. That is very much the case today (TBS, for example, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/tnt-tbs-scripted-programming-development-scrapped-warner-bros-discovery-1235241348/\">is abandoning scripted content</a>, while becoming ever more reliant on sports). What was a mistake was insinuating that this was the &#8220;end&#8221;; after all, as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling\">Jim Barksdale famously observed</a>, the next step after unbundling is bundling.</p>\n<p>To that end, Netflix + Xfinity TV service was a bundle of sorts, but the real takeaway was that Comcast was fine with being simply an Internet provider (which ended up helping with TV margins, since cable companies mostly gave up on fighting to keep cord cutters). Shortly after the Netflix deal Comcast launched <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-xfinity-flex-internet-customers-free-4k-streaming\">Xfinity Flex</a>, a free 4K streaming box for Internet-only subscribers that included a storefront for buying streaming services (which would be billed by Comcast). You can even subscribe to digital MVPDs <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/youtube-tv-launches-on-xfinity-flex\">like YouTube TV</a>!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-xfinity-flex-internet-customers-free-4k-streaming\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=640%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The free Xfinity Flex streaming box\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8951\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=1024%2C609&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=1060%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1060w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first takeaway of an offering like Xfinity Flex ties into the wireless point: cable companies already have a billing relationship with the customer — because they provide the most essential utility for accessing what is most important to said customer — which makes them particularly effective at customer acquisition. That is why Netflix, YouTube, etc. are all willing to pay a revenue share for the help.</p>\n<h4>The Great Rebundling?</h4>\n<p>The second takeaway, though, is that the cable companies are better suited than almost anyone else to rebundle for real. Imagine a &#8220;streaming bundle&#8221; that includes Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, etc., available for a price that is less than the sum of its parts. Sounds too good to be true, right? After all, this kind of sounds like what Apple was envisioning for Apple TV (the app) before Netflix spoiled the fun; I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-should-buy-netflix/\">Apple Should Buy Netflix</a> in 2016:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple’s desire to be “the one place to access all of your television” implies the demotion of Netflix to just another content provider, right alongside its rival HBO and the far more desperate networks who lack any sort of customer relationship at all. It is directly counter to the strategy that has gotten Netflix this far — owning the customer relationship by delivering a superior customer experience — and while Apple may wish to pursue the same strategy, the company has no leverage to do so. Not only is the Apple TV just another black box that connects to your TV (that is also the most expensive), it also, conveniently for Netflix, has a (relatively) open app platform: Netflix can deliver their content on their terms on Apple’s hardware, and there isn’t much Apple can do about it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Six years on and Netflix is in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/netflix-earnings-netflixs-struggling-growth-drivers-netflix-to-explore-advertising/\">a much different place</a>, not only struggling for new customers but also dealing with elevated churn. Owning the customer may be less important than simply having more customers, particularly if those customers are much less likely to churn. After all, that&#8217;s one of the advantages of a bundle: instead of your streaming service needing to produce compelling content every single month, you can work as a team to keep customers on board with the bundle.</p>\n<p>The key point about a bundle, <a href=\"https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling\">as longtime YouTube executive and Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra has written</a>, is that <a href=\"https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling/myth-4-6\">it minimizes SuperFan overlap while maximizing CasualFan overlap</a>; in other words, effective bundles have more disparate content that you are vaguely interested in, instead of a relatively small amount of focused content that you care about intensely. This makes the bundle concept even more compelling to new entrants in the streaming wars, who may not have as large of libraries as Netflix, and certainly don&#8217;t have as many subscribers over which to spread their content costs.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the fact that the streaming services have largely done their damage to traditional TV, leaving the cable TV bundle as the sports and news bundle, means it is actually viable to create a lower-priced bundle than what was previously available (if you don&#8217;t want sports). After all, you&#8217;re not cannibalizing TV, but rather bringing together what has long since been broken off (unbundling then bundling!).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This isn&#8217;t something that is going to happen overnight: despite the fact that <a href=\"https://cdixon.org/2012/07/08/how-bundling-benefits-sellers-and-buyers\">bundles are good for everyone</a> it is hard to get independents into a bundle as long as they are growing; Netflix&#8217;s recent struggles are encouraging in this regard, particularly if other streaming services start to face similar headwinds. Moreover, cable companies are not the only entities that will seek to pull something like this off: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Roku already make money from revenue shares on streaming subscriptions they sell; all of them sell devices that can be used as interfaces for selling a bundle. And, of course, there are more Internet providers than just the cable companies: there is fiber, wireless, and even Starlink.</p>\n<p>The breadth of the cable company bundle, though, is unmatched: not only might it include streaming services, but also linear TV; more than that, this is the company selling you Internet access, and increasingly wireless phone service. That gives even more latitude for discounts, and perks like no data caps on streamed content, not just at home but also on your phone.</p>\n<p>All of these advantages go back to Robert J. Tarlton and Lansford, Pennsylvania. A recurring point on Stratechery this past year has been the durability and long-term potential inherent in technology rooted in physical space. I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/\">Digital Advertising in 2022</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Real power in technology comes from rooting the digital in something physical: for Amazon that is its fulfillment centers and logistics on the e-commerce side, and its data centers on the cloud side. For Microsoft it is its data centers and its global sales organization and multi-year relationships with basically every enterprise on earth. For Apple it is the iPhone, and for Google is is Android and its mutually beneficial relationship with Apple (this is less secure than Android, but that is why Google is paying an estimated $15 billion annually — and growing — to keep its position). Facebook benefited tremendously from being just an app, but the freedom of movement that entailed meant taking a dependency on iOS and Android, and Apple has exploited that dependency in part, if not yet in full.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>For cable companies, power comes from a wire; it would certainly be ironic if the cord-cutting trumpeted by tech resulted in cable having even more leverage over customers and their wallets than the pre-Internet era.</p>",

The engineers were able to continually refine equipment to add more channels…All these technical advances‑‑continuing advances, automatic gain control, automatic temperature compensation, etc. have made cable what it is today.\n\nOne of the most important technological developments was satellite: now cable systems could get signals both more reliably and from far further away; this actually flipped geography on its head. Tarlton said:\n\n  At that time we went to the highest possible point to look to the transmitter. Today with satellites, we go to the lowest possible point because we don’t want the interference from other signals. So it is ironic that we have changed so much from what we used to do.\n\nWithin these snippets is everything that makes the cable business so compelling:\n\nCable is in high demand because it provides the means to get what customers most highly value.\nCable works best both technologically and financially when it has a geographic monopoly.\nCable creates demand for new supply; technological advances enable more supply, which creates more demand.\n\nIt’s that last bit about satellites being better on lower ground that stands out to me, though: as long as you control the wires into people’s houses you can and should be pragmatic about everything else.\nCable’s Evolution\nTarlton would go on to work for a company called Jerrold Electronics, which pivoted its entire business to create equipment for cities that wanted to emulate Lansford’s system; Tarlton would lead the installation of cable systems across the United States, which for the first two decades of cable mostly retransmitted broadcast television.\nThe aforementioned satellite, though, led to the creation of national TV stations, first HBO, and then WTCG, an independent television station in Atlanta, Georgia, owned by Ted Turner. Turner realized he could buy programming at local rates, but sell advertising at national rates via cable operators eager to feed their customers’ hunger for more stations. Turner soon launched a cable only channel devoted to nothing but news; he called it the Cable News Network — CNN for short (WTCG would later be renamed TBS).\nJerrold Electronics, meanwhile, spun off one of the cable systems it built in Tupelo, Mississippi to an entrepreneur named Ralph Roberts; Roberts proceeded to systematically buy up community cable systems across the country, moving the company’s headquarters to Philadelphia and renaming it to Comcast Corporation (Roberts would eventually hand the business off to his son, Brian). Consolidation in the provision of cable service proceeded in conjunction with consolidation in the production of content, an inevitable outcome of the virtuous cycle I noted above:\n\nCable companies acquired customers who wanted access to content\nStudios created content that customers demanded\n\nThe more customers that a cable company served, the stronger their negotiating position with content providers; the more studios and types of content that a content provider controlled the stronger their negotiating position with cable providers. The end result were a few dominant cable providers (Comcast, Charter, Cox, Altice, Mediacom) and a few dominant content companies (Disney, Viacom, NBC Universal, Time Warner, Fox), tussling back-and-forth over a very profitable pie.\nThen came Netflix, and tech industry crowing about cord cutting.\nNetflix and other streaming services were obviously bad for television: they did the same job but in a completely different way, leveraging the Internet to provide content on-demand, unconstrained by the linear nature of television that was a relic of cable’s origin with broadcast TV. Here, though, cable’s ownership of the wires was an effective hedge: the same wires that delivered linear TV delivered packet-based Internet content.\nMoreover, this didn’t simply mean that cable’s TV losses were made up for by Internet service: Internet service was much higher margin because companies like Comcast didn’t need to negotiate with a limited number of content providers; everything on the Internet was free. This has meant that the fortunes of cable companies has boomed over the last decade, even as cord-cutting has cut the cable TV business by about a third.\nCable companies today, though, are yet another category down from their pandemic highs, thanks to fear that the broadband growth story is mostly over; fiber offers better performance, 5G opens the door to wireless in the home, and anyone who doesn’t have broadband now is probably never going to get it. I think, though, this underrates the strategic positioning of cable companies, and ignores the industry’s demonstrated ability to adapt to new strategic environments.\nThe Wireless Opportunity\nFrom the Wall Street Journal in 2011:\n\n  Verizon Wireless will pay $3.6 billion to buy wireless spectrum licenses from a group of cable-television companies, bringing an end to their years-long flirtation with setting up its own cellphone service. The sellers—Comcast Time Warner Cable Inc. and Bright House Networks—acquired the spectrum in a government auction in 2006 and now will turn it over to the country’s biggest wireless carrier at more than a 50% markup. While cable companies have dabbled with wireless, the spectrum has largely sat around unused, prompting years of speculation about the industry’s intentions…\n  Under the deal, Verizon Wireless will be able to sell its service in the cable companies’ stores. The carrier, in turn, will be able to sell the cable companies’ broadband, video and voice services in its stores. Verizon’s FiOS service only reaches 14% of U.S. households, according to Bernstein Research. In four years’ time, the cable companies will have the option to buy service on Verizon’s network on a wholesale basis and then resell it under their own brand.\n  The joint marketing arrangement “amounts to a partnership between formerly mortal enemies,” wrote Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in a research note.\n\nMoffett would later partner with Michael Nathanson to form their own independent research firm (called MoffettNathanson, natch); Moffett released an updated report last month that explained how that Verizon deal ended up playing out:\n\n  When Comcast and Time Warner Cable sold their AWS-1 spectrum to Verizon back in 2011, they believed at the time that they were walking away from ever becoming facilities-based wireless players. They therefore viewed it as imperative that the sale come with an MVNO agreement with Verizon to compensate for that forfeiture. They got precisely what they wanted, an MVNO contract with Verizon that was described at the time as “perpetual and irrevocable“…\n  It took another six years after that transaction before Comcast finally launched Xfinity Mobile in mid-2017. Charter [which merged with Time Warner Cable, acquiring the latter’s MVNO rights] followed suit a year later…in four short years, the Cable operators have become the fastest growing wireless providers in the country, accounting for nearly 30% of wireless industry net additions. Cable’s 7.7 million mobile lines represent ~2.5% of the U.S. mobile phone market (including prepaid and postpaid phones).\n\nAs Moffett notes, this growth is particularly impressive given that most cable companies couldn’t feasibly offer family plans under the terms of the original deal, which was negotiated before such a concept even existed; the deal has been re-negotiated, though, and almost certainly to the cable companies’ advantage: if Verizon is going to lose customers to an MVNO, it would surely prefer said MVNO be on their network; this means that the cable companies have negotiating leverage.\nWhat, though, makes the cable companies such effective MVNOs? One of the most interesting parts of Moffett’s note was proprietary data about the amount of data used by cellular subscribers; it turns out that cable MVNO customers are far more likely to consume data over WiFi, perhaps because of cable company out-of-home WiFi hot spots. This could become even more favorable in the future as cable companies build out Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) service, particularly in dense areas where cable companies have wires from which to hang CBRS transmitters. Moffett writes:\n\n  In a perfect world, Cable will offload traffic onto their own facilities where doing so is cheap (high density, high use locations) and leave to Verizon the burden of carrying traffic where doing so is/would be expensive. Because the MVNO agreement is “perpetual and irrevocable,” and is based on average prices (i.e., the same price everywhere, whether easy or hard to reach), Cable is presented with a perfect ROI arbitrage; they can take the high ROI parts of the network for themselves, and leave the low ROI parts of the network to their MVNO host… all without sacrificing anything with respect to their national coverage footprint.\n\nOne can understand why Verizon gave the cable companies these rights in 2011; the phone company desperately needed spectrum, and besides, everyone knew that MVNOs could never be economically competitive with their wholesale providers, who were the ones that actually made the investments in the network.\nThat’s the thing, though: cable companies had their own massive build-out, one that was both much older in its origins and, because it connected the house, actually carried more data. This was to the benefit of Verizon and other cellular providers, of course: a Verizon iPhone uses WiFi at home just as much as a Comcast iPhone does; here, though, it was cable that had internet economics on its side: there is no competitive harm in giving equal access to an abundant resource; it is cellular access that is scarce, which means that the cable companies’ MVNO deal, in conjunction with their out-of-home Internet access options, gives them a meaningful advantage.\nCustomer Acquisition\nMoffett spends less time on customer acquisition; anecdotally speaking, it’s clear that Charter’s Spectrum, which provides the cable service I consume (via the excellent Channels application), is pushing wireless service hard: phones are front-and-center in their stores, and Spectrum wireless commercials fill local inventory. Moreover, this is a well-trodden playbook: cable companies came to dominate the fixed line phone service business simply because it was easier to get your TV, Internet, and phone all in the same place (and of those, the most important was TV, and now Internet); it’s always easier to upsell an existing subscriber than it is to acquire a new one.\nOf course cable companies long handled customer acquisition for content creators — that was the cable bundle in a nutshell. What is interesting is how this customer acquisition capability is attractive to the companies undoing that bundle: Netflix, for example, put its service on Comcast’s set-top boxes in 2016, and made a deal for Comcast to sell its service in 2018. I wrote in a Daily Update at the time:\n\n  Netflix, meanwhile, is laddering up again: the company doesn’t actually need a billing relationship with end users, it just needs ever more end users (along with the data about what they watch) to spread its fixed content costs more widely; the company said in its shareholder letter that:\n\n    These relationships allow our partners to attract more customers and to upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while we benefit from more reach, awareness and often, less friction in the signup and payment process. We believe that the lower churn in these bundles offsets the lower Netflix ASP.\n  \n  What is particularly interesting is that this arrangement moves the industry closer to the endgame I predicted in The Great Unbundling…\n\n“Endgame” was a bit strong: that Article was, as the title says, about unbundling; one of my arguments was that the traditional cable TV bundle would become primarily anchored on live sports and news, while most scripted content went to streaming. That is very much the case today (TBS, for example, is abandoning scripted content, while becoming ever more reliant on sports). What was a mistake was insinuating that this was the “end”; after all, as Jim Barksdale famously observed, the next step after unbundling is bundling.\nTo that end, Netflix + Xfinity TV service was a bundle of sorts, but the real takeaway was that Comcast was fine with being simply an Internet provider (which ended up helping with TV margins, since cable companies mostly gave up on fighting to keep cord cutters). Shortly after the Netflix deal Comcast launched Xfinity Flex, a free 4K streaming box for Internet-only subscribers that included a storefront for buying streaming services (which would be billed by Comcast). You can even subscribe to digital MVPDs like YouTube TV!\n\nThe first takeaway of an offering like Xfinity Flex ties into the wireless point: cable companies already have a billing relationship with the customer — because they provide the most essential utility for accessing what is most important to said customer — which makes them particularly effective at customer acquisition. That is why Netflix, YouTube, etc. are all willing to pay a revenue share for the help.\nThe Great Rebundling?\nThe second takeaway, though, is that the cable companies are better suited than almost anyone else to rebundle for real. Imagine a “streaming bundle” that includes Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, etc., available for a price that is less than the sum of its parts. Sounds too good to be true, right? After all, this kind of sounds like what Apple was envisioning for Apple TV (the app) before Netflix spoiled the fun; I wrote in Apple Should Buy Netflix in 2016:\n\n  Apple’s desire to be “the one place to access all of your television” implies the demotion of Netflix to just another content provider, right alongside its rival HBO and the far more desperate networks who lack any sort of customer relationship at all. It is directly counter to the strategy that has gotten Netflix this far — owning the customer relationship by delivering a superior customer experience — and while Apple may wish to pursue the same strategy, the company has no leverage to do so. Not only is the Apple TV just another black box that connects to your TV (that is also the most expensive), it also, conveniently for Netflix, has a (relatively) open app platform: Netflix can deliver their content on their terms on Apple’s hardware, and there isn’t much Apple can do about it.\n\nSix years on and Netflix is in a much different place, not only struggling for new customers but also dealing with elevated churn. Owning the customer may be less important than simply having more customers, particularly if those customers are much less likely to churn. After all, that’s one of the advantages of a bundle: instead of your streaming service needing to produce compelling content every single month, you can work as a team to keep customers on board with the bundle.\nThe key point about a bundle, as longtime YouTube executive and Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra has written, is that it minimizes SuperFan overlap while maximizing CasualFan overlap; in other words, effective bundles have more disparate content that you are vaguely interested in, instead of a relatively small amount of focused content that you care about intensely. This makes the bundle concept even more compelling to new entrants in the streaming wars, who may not have as large of libraries as Netflix, and certainly don’t have as many subscribers over which to spread their content costs.\nMoreover, the fact that the streaming services have largely done their damage to traditional TV, leaving the cable TV bundle as the sports and news bundle, means it is actually viable to create a lower-priced bundle than what was previously available (if you don’t want sports). After all, you’re not cannibalizing TV, but rather bringing together what has long since been broken off (unbundling then bundling!).\n\nThis isn’t something that is going to happen overnight: despite the fact that bundles are good for everyone it is hard to get independents into a bundle as long as they are growing; Netflix’s recent struggles are encouraging in this regard, particularly if other streaming services start to face similar headwinds. Moreover, cable companies are not the only entities that will seek to pull something like this off: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Roku already make money from revenue shares on streaming subscriptions they sell; all of them sell devices that can be used as interfaces for selling a bundle. And, of course, there are more Internet providers than just the cable companies: there is fiber, wireless, and even Starlink.\nThe breadth of the cable company bundle, though, is unmatched: not only might it include streaming services, but also linear TV; more than that, this is the company selling you Internet access, and increasingly wireless phone service. That gives even more latitude for discounts, and perks like no data caps on streamed content, not just at home but also on your phone.\nAll of these advantages go back to Robert J. Tarlton and Lansford, Pennsylvania. A recurring point on Stratechery this past year has been the durability and long-term potential inherent in technology rooted in physical space. I wrote in Digital Advertising in 2022:\n\n  Real power in technology comes from rooting the digital in something physical: for Amazon that is its fulfillment centers and logistics on the e-commerce side, and its data centers on the cloud side. For Microsoft it is its data centers and its global sales organization and multi-year relationships with basically every enterprise on earth. For Apple it is the iPhone, and for Google is is Android and its mutually beneficial relationship with Apple (this is less secure than Android, but that is why Google is paying an estimated $15 billion annually — and growing — to keep its position). Facebook benefited tremendously from being just an app, but the freedom of movement that entailed meant taking a dependency on iOS and Android, and Apple has exploited that dependency in part, if not yet in full.\n\nFor cable companies, power comes from a wire; it would certainly be ironic if the cord-cutting trumpeted by tech resulted in cable having even more leverage over customers and their wallets than the pre-Internet era.",

      "content_html": "<p>Five months and $134 billion in market cap ago (before the stock slipped by 68%), Bloomberg Businessweek purported to explain <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-23/shopify-amazon-retail-rivalry-heats-up-with-covid-sparked-online-shopping-booma\">How Shopify Outfoxed Amazon to Become the Everywhere Store</a>. One of the key parts of the story was how Shopify pulled one over on Amazon seven years ago:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  An even more critical event came a few months after the IPO. Amazon also operated a service that let independent merchants run their websites, called Webstore. Bang &amp; Olufsen, Fruit of the Loom, and Lacoste were among the 80,000 or so companies that used it to run their online shops. If he wanted to, Bezos surely had the resources and engineering prowess to crush Shopify and steal its momentum.</p>\n<p>  But Amazon execs from that time admit that the Webstore service wasn’t very good, and its sales were dwarfed by all the rich opportunities the company was seeing in its global marketplace, where customers shop on Amazon.com, not on merchant websites…In late 2015, in one of Bezos’ periodic purges of underachieving businesses, he agreed to close Webstore. Then, in a rare strategic mistake that’s likely to go down in the annals of corporate blunders, Amazon sent its customers to Shopify and proclaimed publicly that the Canadian company was its preferred partner for the Webstore diaspora. In exchange, Shopify agreed to offer Amazon Pay to its merchants and let them easily list their products on Amazon’s marketplace. Shopify also paid Amazon $1 million—a financial arrangement that’s never been previously reported.</p>\n<p>  Bezos and his colleagues believed that supporting small retailers and their online shops was never going to be a large, profitable business. They were wrong—small online retailers generated about $153 billion in sales in 2020, according to AMI Partners. “Shopify made us look like fools,” says the former Amazon executive.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If only we could all make such excellent mistakes; Amazon&#8217;s move looks like a strategic masterstroke.</p>\n<h4>Shopify&#8217;s Revenue Streams</h4>\n<p>Three major things have changed, will change, or should change about Shopify&#8217;s business in the years since the company made that deal with Amazon.</p>\n<p>What has changed is the composition of Shopify&#8217;s business. While the company started out with a SaaS model, the business has transformed into a commission-based one:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=640%2C389&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify&#039;s two revenue streams\" width=\"640\" height=\"389\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8866\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=1024%2C623&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=1035%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1035w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;Subscription Solutions&#8221; are Shopify&#8217;s platform fees, including the cost to use the platform (or upgrade to the company&#8217;s Pro offering), commissions from the sales of themes and apps, and domain name registration. &#8220;Merchant Solutions&#8221;, meanwhile, are all of the fees that are generated from ongoing sales; the largest part of this are payment processing fees from Shopify Payments, but other fees include advertising revenue, referral fees, Shopify Shipping, etc.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the shipping part that is line for big changes: while Shopify first announced the Shopify Fulfillment Network <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">back in 2019</a>, it is only recently that the company has committed to actually building out important pieces of said network on its own, the better to compete with Amazon&#8217;s full-scale offering.</p>\n<p>As for what <em>should</em> change, I argued <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/\">back in February</a> that Shopify needed to build out an advertising network; this recommendation is more pertinent than ever, in large part because the second item on this list might be in big trouble.</p>\n<h4>Buy With Prime</h4>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-coming-to-other-online-sites-11650556838\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Amazon.com Inc. is extending some of the offerings of its popular Prime membership program to merchants off its platform with a new service that embeds the online retailing giant’s payment and fulfillment options onto third-party sites. Called Buy with Prime, the service will allow merchants to show the Prime logo and offer Amazon’s speedy delivery options on products listed on their own websites…</p>\n<p>  The company said the Buy with Prime offer will be rolled out by invitation only through 2022 for those who already sell on Amazon and use the company’s fulfillment services. Later, Amazon plans to extend Buy with Prime to other merchants, including those that don’t sell on its platform. Participating merchants will use the Prime logo and display expected delivery dates on eligible products. Checkout will go through Amazon Pay and the company’s fulfillment network. Amazon will also manage free returns for eligible orders.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a move that you could see coming for a long time; back in 2016 I wrote an article called <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/\">The Amazon Tax</a> that explained that the best way to understand Amazon as a whole was to understand Amazon Web Services (AWS):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The “primitives” model modularized Amazon’s infrastructure, effectively transforming raw data center components into storage, computing, databases, etc. which could be used on an ad-hoc basis not only by Amazon’s internal teams but also outside developers:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=640%2C461&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The AWS Layer\" width=\"640\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2073\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=1024%2C738&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=874%2C630&amp;ssl=1 874w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  This AWS layer in the middle has several key characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS has massive fixed costs but benefits tremendously from economies of scale</li>\n<li>The cost to build AWS was justified because the first and best customer is Amazon’s e-commerce business</li>\n<li>AWS’s focus on “primitives” meant it could be sold as-is to developers beyond Amazon, increasing the returns to scale and, by extension, deepening AWS’ moat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  This last point was a win-win: developers would have access to enterprise-level computing resources with zero up-front investment; Amazon, meanwhile, would get that much more scale for a set of products for which they would be the first and best customer.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I noted in that article, the AWS model was being increasingly applied to e-commerce as Amazon shifted from being a retailer to being a services provider:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Prime is a super experience with superior prices and superior selection, and it too feeds into a scale play. The result is a business that looks like this:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=640%2C461&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The Transformation of Amazon’s E-Commerce Business\" width=\"640\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2072\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=1024%2C738&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=874%2C630&amp;ssl=1 874w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?w=1876&amp;ssl=1 1876w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  That is, of course, the same structure as AWS — and it shares similar characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E-commerce distribution has massive fixed costs but benefits tremendously from economies of scale</li>\n<li>The cost to build-out Amazon’s fulfillment centers was justified because the first and best customer is Amazon’s e-commerce business</li>\n<li>That last bullet point may seem odd, but in fact 40% of Amazon’s sales (on a unit basis) are sold by 3rd-party merchants; most of these merchants leverage Fulfilled-by-Amazon, which means their goods are stored in Amazon’s fulfillment centers and covered by Prime. This increases the return to scale for Amazon’s fulfillment centers, increases the value of Prime, and deepens Amazon’s moat</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My prediction in that Article was that Amazon&#8217;s burgeoning logistics business would eventually follow the same path:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It seems increasingly clear that Amazon intends to repeat the model when it comes to logistics…how might this play out? Well, start with the fact that Amazon itself would be this logistics network’s first-and-best customer, just as was the case with AWS. This justifies the massive expenditure necessary to build out a logistics network that competes with UPS, Fedex, et al, and most outlets are framing these moves as a way for Amazon to rein in shipping costs and improve reliability, especially around the holidays.</p>\n<p>  However, I think it is a mistake to think that Amazon will stop there: just as they have with AWS and e-commerce distribution I expect the company to offer its logistics network to third parties, which will increase the returns to scale, and, by extension, deepen Amazon’s eventual moat\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today Amazon&#8217;s logistics is massive and fully integrated from the fulfillment center to the doorstep, even though it only serves Amazon; the obvious next step is opening it up to non-Amazon retailers, and that is exactly what is happening.</p>\n<h4>Beyond Aggregation</h4>\n<p>At first glance, this might seem like a bit of a surprise; after all, Stratechery is well known for describing <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>, which is predicated on controlling demand. In the case of Amazon that has meant controlling the website where customers order goods — Amazon.com — even if those goods were sold by 3rd-party merchants. Why would Amazon give that up?</p>\n<p>The reasoning is straightforward: while Amazon has had Aggregator characteristics, the company&#8217;s business model and differentiation has always been rooted in the real world, which, by extension, means it is not an Aggregator at all. I noted in 2017&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/\">Defining Aggregators</a> that Aggregators benefit from zero marginal costs, which only describes a certain set of digital businesses like Google and Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Companies traditionally have had to incur (up to) three types of marginal costs when it comes to serving users/customers directly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of goods sold (COGS), that is, the cost of producing an item or providing a service</li>\n<li>Distribution costs, that is the cost of getting an item to the customer (usually via retail) or facilitating the provision of a service (usually via real estate)</li>\n<li>Transaction costs, that is the cost of executing a transaction for a good or service, providing customer service, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  Aggregators incur none of these costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The goods “sold” by an Aggregator are digital and thus have zero marginal costs (they may, of course, have significant fixed costs)</li>\n<li>These digital goods are delivered via the Internet, which results in zero distribution costs</li>\n<li>Transactions are handled automatically through automatic account management, credit card payments, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  This characteristic means that businesses like Apple hardware and Amazon’s traditional retail operations are not Aggregators; both bear significant costs in serving the marginal customer (and, in the case of Amazon in particular, have achieved such scale that the service’s relative cost of distribution is actually a moat).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s control of demand has been — and will continue to be — a tremendous advantage; Amazon not only has power over its suppliers, but it also gets all of the relevant data from consumers, which it can feed into a self-contained ad platform that is untouched by regulation from either governments or Apple.</p>\n<p>At the same time, limiting a business to customer touchpoints that you control means limiting your overall addressable market. This may not matter in markets where there are network effects (which means you appeal to everyone) and you are an Aggregator dealing with zero marginal costs (and thus can realistically cover every consumer); in the case of e-commerce, though, Amazon will never be the only option, particularly given <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">The Anti-Amazon Alliance</a> working hard to reach consumers.</p>\n<p>A core part of the Anti-Amazon Alliance are companies that have invested in brands that attract customers on their own; these companies don&#8217;t need to be on Amazon fighting to be the answer to generic search terms, but can rather drive customers to their own Shopify-powered websites both organically and via paid advertising (Facebook is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/\">a huge player</a> in the Anti-Amazon Alliance). Still, every customer that visits these websites has an Amazon-driven expectation in terms of shipping; Shippo CEO Laura Behrens Wu told me in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/an-update-on-the-founder-series-shopify-partners-with-shippo-an-interview-with-shippo-founder-laura-behrens-wu/\">a Stratechery interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Consumers have those expectations from Amazon that shipping should be free, it should be two days, and whatever those are expectations are, returns should be free. That is still carried over when I’m buying on this branded website. If the expectations are not met, consumers decide to buy somewhere else…Merchants are constantly trying to play catch up, whatever Amazon is doing they need to follow suit.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now Amazon has — or soon will have, in the case of Shopify-only merchants — a solution: the best way to get an Amazon-like shipping experience is to ship via Amazon. And, in contrast to the crappy Webstore product, you can keep using Shopify and its ecosystem for your website. Amazon may have given away business to Shopify in 2015, but that doesn&#8217;t much matter if said business ends up being a commoditized complement to Amazon&#8217;s true differentiation in logistics. That business, thanks to the sheer expense necessary to build it out, has a nearly impregnable moat that is not only attractive to all of the businesses competing to be consumer touchpoints — thus increasing Amazon&#8217;s addressable market — but is also one that sees its moat deepen the larger it becomes.</p>\n<h4>Shopify&#8217;s Predicament and Amazon&#8217;s Opportunity</h4>\n<p>The reason this announcement is so damaging to Shopify goes back to the transformation in the company&#8217;s revenue I charted above: Amazon&#8217;s shipping solution requires the customer to pay with Amazon; I love Shop Pay&#8217;s checkout process, but it&#8217;s not as if I don&#8217;t have an Amazon account with all of my relevant details already included, and I absolutely trust Amazon&#8217;s shipping more than I do whatever option some Shopify merchant offers me. If I had a choice I&#8217;m taking the Amazon option every time.</p>\n<p>Granted, I may not be representative; I&#8217;m a bit of a special case <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-relentless-jeff-bezos/\">given where I live</a>. What is worth noting, though, is that every transaction that Amazon processes is one <em>not</em> processed by Shopify, which again, is the company&#8217;s primary revenue driver. Moreover, the more volume that Amazon processes, the more difficult it will be for Shopify to get their own shipping solution to scale. This endangers the company&#8217;s current major initiative.</p>\n<p>That is why <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/\">I think the company needs to think more deeply than ever about advertising</a>: the implication of Amazon being willing to be a services provider and not necessarily an Aggregator is that Amazon is surrendering some number of customer touchpoints to competitors; to put it another way, Amazon is actually making competitive customer touchpoints better — touchpoints that Shopify controls. Shopify ought to leverage that control.</p>\n<p>That noted, there is a potential wrench in this plan: if Shopify doesn&#8217;t own payment processing, will they have sufficient data to build a competitive conversion-data-driven advertising product? Amazon — and Apple — would likely argue that that data is Amazon&#8217;s, but the merchant will obviously know what is going on (by the same token, will Amazon be able to tie this off-platform conversion data back to its own advertising product? It&#8217;s not clear what would stop them).</p>\n<p>Shopify has two additional saving graces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the fact that Amazon will be able to collect data is a big reason for many merchants not to use Amazon&#8217;s new offering.

AWS&#8217;s strength is its focus on infrastructure at scale; successfully moving e-commerce beyond aggregation to the same type of service business model would put his stamp on the company in a meaningful way, and, contra that quote in Bloomberg Businessweek, mark Jassy as nobody&#8217;s fool.</p>",
      "content_text": "Five months and $134 billion in market cap ago (before the stock slipped by 68%), Bloomberg Businessweek purported to explain How Shopify Outfoxed Amazon to Become the Everywhere Store. One of the key parts of the story was how Shopify pulled one over on Amazon seven years ago:\n\n  An even more critical event came a few months after the IPO. Amazon also operated a service that let independent merchants run their websites, called Webstore. Bang & Olufsen, Fruit of the Loom, and Lacoste were among the 80,000 or so companies that used it to run their online shops. If he wanted to, Bezos surely had the resources and engineering prowess to crush Shopify and steal its momentum.\n  But Amazon execs from that time admit that the Webstore service wasn’t very good, and its sales were dwarfed by all the rich opportunities the company was seeing in its global marketplace, where customers shop on Amazon.com, not on merchant websites…In late 2015, in one of Bezos’ periodic purges of underachieving businesses, he agreed to close Webstore. Then, in a rare strategic mistake that’s likely to go down in the annals of corporate blunders, Amazon sent its customers to Shopify and proclaimed publicly that the Canadian company was its preferred partner for the Webstore diaspora. In exchange, Shopify agreed to offer Amazon Pay to its merchants and let them easily list their products on Amazon’s marketplace. Shopify also paid Amazon $1 million—a financial arrangement that’s never been previously reported.\n  Bezos and his colleagues believed that supporting small retailers and their online shops was never going to be a large, profitable business. They were wrong—small online retailers generated about $153 billion in sales in 2020, according to AMI Partners. “Shopify made us look like fools,” says the former Amazon executive.\n\nIf only we could all make such excellent mistakes; Amazon’s move looks like a strategic masterstroke.\nShopify’s Revenue Streams\nThree major things have changed, will change, or should change about Shopify’s business in the years since the company made that deal with Amazon.\nWhat has changed is the composition of Shopify’s business. While the company started out with a SaaS model, the business has transformed into a commission-based one:\n\n“Subscription Solutions” are Shopify’s platform fees, including the cost to use the platform (or upgrade to the company’s Pro offering), commissions from the sales of themes and apps, and domain name registration. “Merchant Solutions”, meanwhile, are all of the fees that are generated from ongoing sales; the largest part of this are payment processing fees from Shopify Payments, but other fees include advertising revenue, referral fees, Shopify Shipping, etc.\nIt’s the shipping part that is line for big changes: while Shopify first announced the Shopify Fulfillment Network back in 2019, it is only recently that the company has committed to actually building out important pieces of said network on its own, the better to compete with Amazon’s full-scale offering.\nAs for what should change, I argued back in February that Shopify needed to build out an advertising network; this recommendation is more pertinent than ever, in large part because the second item on this list might be in big trouble.\nBuy With Prime\nFrom the Wall Street Journal:\n\n  Amazon.com Inc. is extending some of the offerings of its popular Prime membership program to merchants off its platform with a new service that embeds the online retailing giant’s payment and fulfillment options onto third-party sites. Called Buy with Prime, the service will allow merchants to show the Prime logo and offer Amazon’s speedy delivery options on products listed on their own websites…\n  The company said the Buy with Prime offer will be rolled out by invitation only through 2022 for those who already sell on Amazon and use the company’s fulfillment services. Later, Amazon plans to extend Buy with Prime to other merchants, including those that don’t sell on its platform. Participating merchants will use the Prime logo and display expected delivery dates on eligible products. Checkout will go through Amazon Pay and the company’s fulfillment network. Amazon will also manage free returns for eligible orders.\n\nThis is a move that you could see coming for a long time; back in 2016 I wrote an article called The Amazon Tax that explained that the best way to understand Amazon as a whole was to understand Amazon Web Services (AWS):\n\n  The “primitives” model modularized Amazon’s infrastructure, effectively transforming raw data center components into storage, computing, databases, etc. which could be used on an ad-hoc basis not only by Amazon’s internal teams but also outside developers:\n  \n  This AWS layer in the middle has several key characteristics:\n\nAWS has massive fixed costs but benefits tremendously from economies of scale\nThe cost to build AWS was justified because the first and best customer is Amazon’s e-commerce business\nAWS’s focus on “primitives” meant it could be sold as-is to developers beyond Amazon, increasing the returns to scale and, by extension, deepening AWS’ moat\n\n  This last point was a win-win: developers would have access to enterprise-level computing resources with zero up-front investment; Amazon, meanwhile, would get that much more scale for a set of products for which they would be the first and best customer.\n\nAs I noted in that article, the AWS model was being increasingly applied to e-commerce as Amazon shifted from being a retailer to being a services provider:\n\n  Prime is a super experience with superior prices and superior selection, and it too feeds into a scale play. The result is a business that looks like this:\n  \n  That is, of course, the same structure as AWS — and it shares similar characteristics:\n\nE-commerce distribution has massive fixed costs but benefits tremendously from economies of scale\nThe cost to build-out Amazon’s fulfillment centers was justified because the first and best customer is Amazon’s e-commerce business\nThat last bullet point may seem odd, but in fact 40% of Amazon’s sales (on a unit basis) are sold by 3rd-party merchants; most of these merchants leverage Fulfilled-by-Amazon, which means their goods are stored in Amazon’s fulfillment centers and covered by Prime. This increases the return to scale for Amazon’s fulfillment centers, increases the value of Prime, and deepens Amazon’s moat\n\n\nMy prediction in that Article was that Amazon’s burgeoning logistics business would eventually follow the same path:\n\n  It seems increasingly clear that Amazon intends to repeat the model when it comes to logistics…how might this play out? Well, start with the fact that Amazon itself would be this logistics network’s first-and-best customer, just as was the case with AWS. This justifies the massive expenditure necessary to build out a logistics network that competes with UPS, Fedex, et al, and most outlets are framing these moves as a way for Amazon to rein in shipping costs and improve reliability, especially around the holidays.\n  However, I think it is a mistake to think that Amazon will stop there: just as they have with AWS and e-commerce distribution I expect the company to offer its logistics network to third parties, which will increase the returns to scale, and, by extension, deepen Amazon’s eventual moat\n\nToday Amazon’s logistics is massive and fully integrated from the fulfillment center to the doorstep, even though it only serves Amazon; the obvious next step is opening it up to non-Amazon retailers, and that is exactly what is happening.\nBeyond Aggregation\nAt first glance, this might seem like a bit of a surprise; after all, Stratechery is well known for describing Aggregation Theory, which is predicated on controlling demand. In the case of Amazon that has meant controlling the website where customers order goods — Amazon.com — even if those goods were sold by 3rd-party merchants. Why would Amazon give that up?\nThe reasoning is straightforward: while Amazon has had Aggregator characteristics, the company’s business model and differentiation has always been rooted in the real world, which, by extension, means it is not an Aggregator at all. I noted in 2017’s Defining Aggregators that Aggregators benefit from zero marginal costs, which only describes a certain set of digital businesses like Google and Facebook:\n\n  Companies traditionally have had to incur (up to) three types of marginal costs when it comes to serving users/customers directly.\n\nThe cost of goods sold (COGS), that is, the cost of producing an item or providing a service\nDistribution costs, that is the cost of getting an item to the customer (usually via retail) or facilitating the provision of a service (usually via real estate)\nTransaction costs, that is the cost of executing a transaction for a good or service, providing customer service, etc.\n\n  Aggregators incur none of these costs:\n\nThe goods “sold” by an Aggregator are digital and thus have zero marginal costs (they may, of course, have significant fixed costs)\nThese digital goods are delivered via the Internet, which results in zero distribution costs\nTransactions are handled automatically through automatic account management, credit card payments, etc.\n\n  This characteristic means that businesses like Apple hardware and Amazon’s traditional retail operations are not Aggregators; both bear significant costs in serving the marginal customer (and, in the case of Amazon in particular, have achieved such scale that the service’s relative cost of distribution is actually a moat).\n\nAmazon’s control of demand has been — and will continue to be — a tremendous advantage; Amazon not only has power over its suppliers, but it also gets all of the relevant data from consumers, which it can feed into a self-contained ad platform that is untouched by regulation from either governments or Apple.\nAt the same time, limiting a business to customer touchpoints that you control means limiting your overall addressable market. This may not matter in markets where there are network effects (which means you appeal to everyone) and you are an Aggregator dealing with zero marginal costs (and thus can realistically cover every consumer); in the case of e-commerce, though, Amazon will never be the only option, particularly given The Anti-Amazon Alliance working hard to reach consumers.\nA core part of the Anti-Amazon Alliance are companies that have invested in brands that attract customers on their own; these companies don’t need to be on Amazon fighting to be the answer to generic search terms, but can rather drive customers to their own Shopify-powered websites both organically and via paid advertising (Facebook is a huge player in the Anti-Amazon Alliance).

There is no requirement that these clients be owned or managed by the centralized service, and for the first several years of Twitter&#8217;s existence, that is exactly how the service operated: Twitter the company ran the service and the Twitter.com website, while third-parties built clients that let you access Twitter first on the desktop and then on smartphones.</p>\n<p>Mobile was an absolute boon for Twitter: the public messaging service, modeled on SMS, was a natural fit for a smartphone screen, and the immediacy of Twitter updates was perfectly suited to a device that was always connected to the Internet. The explosion in mobile usage, though, led to a situation where Twitter didn&#8217;t actually control the user experience for a huge portion of its users. This actually led to a ton of innovation: Twitterrific, for example, the earliest third party client, came up with the Twitter bird, the term &#8220;tweet&#8221; for a Twitter message, and early paradigms around replies and conversations. It also led to problems, the solutions to which fundamentally changed Twitter&#8217;s potential as a business.</p>\n<p>The first problem that came from Twitter the service relying on third party clients is that the company, which descended into politics and backstabbing from the board level on down almost immediately, was drifting along without a business model; the obvious candidate was advertising, but the easiest way to implement advertising was to control the user interface (and thus insert ads — ads, including promoted tweets, are another distinct service from Twitter itself). Thus Twitter bought Tweetie, widely regarded as the best Twitter mobile client (I was a user), in April 2010, and rebranded and relaunched it as the official Twitter for iPhone app a month later.</p>\n<p>The second problem is that starting in 2010, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Bill Gross (who invented search advertising) started trying to build his own Twitter monetization product called TweetUp; when Twitter acquired Tweetie and made clear they were going to monetize it via advertising, Gross started buying up multiple other third party Twitter clients with the idea of creating a competing network of clients that would monetize independently. Twitter responded in the short term by kicking several of Gross&#8217;s clients off of the platform for dubious terms-of-service violations, and in the long term by killing the 3rd party API for everyone. Clients could keep the users they had but could only add 100,000 more users — ever.</p>\n<p>The net result of these two decisions was that Twitter, its architecture notwithstanding, would be a unified entity where Twitter the company controlled every aspect of the experience, and that that experience would be monetized via advertising.</p>\n<h4>Twitter&#8217;s Reality</h4>\n<p>Twitter has, over 19 different funding rounds (including pre-IPO, IPO, and post-IPO), raised $4.4 billion in funding; meanwhile the company has lost a cumulative $861 million in its lifetime as a public company (i.e. excluding pre-IPO losses). During that time the company has held 33 earnings calls; the company reported a profit in only 14 of them.</p>\n<p>Given this financial performance it is kind of amazing that the company was valued at $30 billion the day before Musk&#8217;s investment was revealed; such is the value of Twitter&#8217;s social graph and its cultural impact: despite there being no evidence that Twitter can even be sustainably profitable, much less return billions of dollars to shareholders, hope springs eternal that the company is on the verge of unlocking its potential. At the same time, these three factors — Twitter&#8217;s financials, its social graph, and its cultural impact — get at why Musk&#8217;s offer to take Twitter private is so intriguing.</p>\n<p>Start with the financials: Twitter&#8217;s business stinks. Yes, you can make an argument that this is due to mismanagement and poor execution — who enjoys seeing a stale promoted tweet about something that happened weeks ago?<sup id=\"rf1-8837\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/back-to-the-future-of-twitter/#fn1-8837\" title=\"A friend sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1507369880995221507?s=20&#038;t=zgb8z5yVvmOQh03qrqwNAg&quot;&gt;this promoted tweet&lt;/a&gt; on April 15, almost a full month since Kentucky had been eliminated from March Madness, and well over a week after the entire tournament had ended\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> — but <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/twitter-has-a-new-ceo-what-about-a-new-business-model/\">I have also made the argument</a> that Twitter just isn&#8217;t well suited to direct response advertising in particular:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Think about the contrast between Twitter and Instagram; both are unique amongst social networks in that they follow a broadcast model: tweets on Twitter and photos on Instagram are public by default, and anyone can follow anyone. The default medium, though, is fundamentally different: Twitter has photos and videos, but the heart of the service is text (and links). Instagram, on the other hand, is nothing but photos and video (and link in bio).</p>\n<p>  The implications of this are vast. Sure, you may follow your friends on both, but on Twitter you will also follow news breakers, analysts, insightful anons, joke tellers, and shit posters. The goal is to mainline information, and Twitter’s speed and information density are unparalleled by anything in the world. On Instagram, though, you might follow brands and influencers, and your chief interaction with your friends is stories about their Turkey Day exploits. It’s about aspiration, not information, and the former makes a lot more sense for effective advertising.</p>\n<p>  It’s more than just the medium though; it’s about the user’s mental state as well. Instagram is leisurely and an escape, something you do when you’re procrastinating; Twitter is intense and combative, and far more likely to be tied to something happening in the physical world, whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/twitter-has-a-new-ceo-what-about-a-new-business-model/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=640%2C373&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Instagram is a lean-back experience; on Twitter you lean forward\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8120\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?w=857&amp;ssl=1 857w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  This matters for advertising, particularly advertising that depends on a direct response: when you are leaning back and relaxed why not click through to that Shopify site to buy that knick-knack you didn’t even know you needed, or try out that mobile game? When you are leaning forward, though, you don’t have either the time or the inclination.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article made the argument for Twitter to move towards more of a subscription offering; that may be the wrong idea, but the bigger takeaway is that what Twitter has been trying to build for years just isn&#8217;t working, and the challenges aren&#8217;t just bad management. To put it another way, when it comes to Twitter&#8217;s business, there really isn&#8217;t much to lose, but Twitter could only risk losing what there is if it were a private company, free from the glare of public markets who, for very justifiable reasons, give Twitter&#8217;s management a very short leash.</p>\n<p>What is valuable is that social graph: while Facebook understands who you know, Twitter, more than any other company, understands what its users are interested in. That is, in theory, much more valuable; said value is diminished by the fact that Twitter just doesn&#8217;t have that many users, relatively speaking; the users it has, though, are extremely influential, particularly given the important of Twitter in media, tech, and finance. For this group Twitter is completely irreplaceable: there is no other medium with a similar density of information or interest-driven network effects.</p>\n<p>This, by extension, drives Twitter&#8217;s cultural impact: no, most people don&#8217;t get their news off of Twitter; the places they get their news, though, are driven by Twitter. Moreover, Twitter not only sets the agenda for media organizations, it also harmonizes coverage, thanks to a dynamic where writers, unmoored from geographic constraints or underlying business realities of their publications, end up writing for other writers on Twitter, oftentimes radicalizing each other in plain sight of their readership. Twitter itself is part of this harmonization, going so far as to censor politically impactful stories in the weeks before an election; it&#8217;s no surprise that when Musk says he wants to impose a stronger free speech ethos that the reaction is fierce and littered with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy\">motte-and-baileys</a> (&#8220;actually we just care about limiting abuse and spam!&#8221;).</p>\n<h4>Back to the Future</h4>\n<p>This is all build-up to my proposal for what Musk — or any other bidder for Twitter, for that matter — ought to do with a newly private Twitter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, Twitter&#8217;s current fully integrated model is a financial failure.</li>\n<li>Second, Twitter&#8217;s social graph is extremely valuable.</li>\n<li>Third, Twitter&#8217;s cultural impact is very large, and very controversial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given this, Musk (who I will use as a stand-in for any future CEO of Twitter) should start by splitting Twitter into two companies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One company would be the core Twitter service, including the social graph.</li>\n<li>The other company would be all of the Twitter apps and the advertising business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TwitterAppCo would contract with TwitterServiceCo to continue to receive access to the Twitter service and social graph; currently Twitter earns around $13/user/year in advertising, so you could imagine a price of say $7.50/user/year, or perhaps $0.75/user/month. TwitterAppCo would be free to pursue the same business model and moderation policies that Twitter is pursuing today (I can imagine Musk sticking with TwitterServiceCo, and the employees upset about said control being a part of TwitterAppCo).</p>\n<p>However, that relationship would not be exclusive: TwitterServiceCo would open up its API to any other company that might be interested in building their own client experience; each company would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay for the right to get access to the Twitter service and social graph.</li>\n<li>Monetize in whatever way they see fit (i.e. they could pursue a subscription model).</li>\n<li>Implement their own moderation policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This last point would cut a whole host of Gordian Knots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market competition would settle the question about whether or not stringent moderation is an important factor in success; some client experiences would be heavily moderated, and some wouldn&#8217;t be moderated at all.</li>\n<li>The fact that everyone gets access to the same Twitter service and social graph solves the cold start problem for alternative networks; the reason why Twitter alternatives always fail is because Twitter&#8217;s network effect is so important.</li>\n<li>TwitterServiceCo could wash its hands of difficult moderation decisions or tricky cultural issues; the U.S. might have a whole host of Twitter client options, while Europe might be more stringent, and India more stringent still.

If you can know how to reach someone, and have the means to do so, you are set, whether you be a critical service, an advertiser, or anything in-between. Twitter has the potential to fill that role: the ability to route short messages to a knowable endpoint accessible via a centralized directory has far more utility than political signaling and infighting.

      "content_text": "Elon Musk wrote in a letter to Twitter’s board:\n\n  I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.\n  However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\n  As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced. My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.\n  Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.\n\nThe vast majority of commentary about the Musk-Twitter saga has focused on the first three paragraphs: what does Musk mean by making Twitter more free speech oriented? Why doesn’t Musk believe he can work with the current board and management? Does Musk have the cash available to buy Twitter, and would the Twitter board accept his offer (no on the latter, but more on this below)?\nThe most interesting question of all, though, is the last paragraph: what potential does Musk see, and could he unlock it? For my part, not only do I agree the potential is vast, but I do think Musk could unlock it — and that itself has implications for the preceding paragraphs.\nWhat is Twitter?\nIt’s popular on Twitter to point to a funny tweet or exchange and marvel that “This website is free“, or alternatively, “This app is free“. That raises the question, though, what is Twitter: is it a website or an app, or something different?\nThe answer, of course, is “All of the above”, but it’s worth being clear about the different pieces that make up Twitter; “Jin” made this illustration on Medium:\n\nTwitter is actually a host of microservices, including a user service (for listing a user’s timeline), a graph service (for tracking your network), a posting service (for posting new tweets), a profile service (for user profiles), a timeline service (for presenting your timeline), etc.; the architecture to tie all of these together and operate at scale all around the world is suitably complex.\nThe key thing to note, though, is that only the green boxes in the diagram above are actually user-facing; a dramatically simplified version of Twitter, that condenses all of those internal services to a big blue “Twitter” box and focuses on the green interfaces might look something like this:\n\nAgain, this is a dramatic oversimplification, but the important takeaway is that the user-facing parts of Twitter are distinct from — and, frankly, not very pertinent to — the core Twitter service.\nTwitter’s API Drama\nThe general idea behind a services architecture is that various functionalities are exposed via application programming interfaces, more commonly known as APIs; a “client” will leverage these APIs to build an end user experience. There is no requirement that these clients be owned or managed by the centralized service, and for the first several years of Twitter’s existence, that is exactly how the service operated: Twitter the company ran the service and the Twitter.com website, while third-parties built clients that let you access Twitter first on the desktop and then on smartphones.\nMobile was an absolute boon for Twitter: the public messaging service, modeled on SMS, was a natural fit for a smartphone screen, and the immediacy of Twitter updates was perfectly suited to a device that was always connected to the Internet. The explosion in mobile usage, though, led to a situation where Twitter didn’t actually control the user experience for a huge portion of its users. This actually led to a ton of innovation: Twitterrific, for example, the earliest third party client, came up with the Twitter bird, the term “tweet” for a Twitter message, and early paradigms around replies and conversations. It also led to problems, the solutions to which fundamentally changed Twitter’s potential as a business.\nThe first problem that came from Twitter the service relying on third party clients is that the company, which descended into politics and backstabbing from the board level on down almost immediately, was drifting along without a business model; the obvious candidate was advertising, but the easiest way to implement advertising was to control the user interface (and thus insert ads — ads, including promoted tweets, are another distinct service from Twitter itself). Thus Twitter bought Tweetie, widely regarded as the best Twitter mobile client (I was a user), in April 2010, and rebranded and relaunched it as the official Twitter for iPhone app a month later.\nThe second problem is that starting in 2010, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Bill Gross (who invented search advertising) started trying to build his own Twitter monetization product called TweetUp; when Twitter acquired Tweetie and made clear they were going to monetize it via advertising, Gross started buying up multiple other third party Twitter clients with the idea of creating a competing network of clients that would monetize independently. Twitter responded in the short term by kicking several of Gross’s clients off of the platform for dubious terms-of-service violations, and in the long term by killing the 3rd party API for everyone. Clients could keep the users they had but could only add 100,000 more users — ever.\nThe net result of these two decisions was that Twitter, its architecture notwithstanding, would be a unified entity where Twitter the company controlled every aspect of the experience, and that that experience would be monetized via advertising.\nTwitter’s Reality\nTwitter has, over 19 different funding rounds (including pre-IPO, IPO, and post-IPO), raised $4.4 billion in funding; meanwhile the company has lost a cumulative $861 million in its lifetime as a public company (i.e. excluding pre-IPO losses). During that time the company has held 33 earnings calls; the company reported a profit in only 14 of them.\nGiven this financial performance it is kind of amazing that the company was valued at $30 billion the day before Musk’s investment was revealed; such is the value of Twitter’s social graph and its cultural impact: despite there being no evidence that Twitter can even be sustainably profitable, much less return billions of dollars to shareholders, hope springs eternal that the company is on the verge of unlocking its potential. At the same time, these three factors — Twitter’s financials, its social graph, and its cultural impact — get at why Musk’s offer to take Twitter private is so intriguing.\nStart with the financials: Twitter’s business stinks. Yes, you can make an argument that this is due to mismanagement and poor execution — who enjoys seeing a stale promoted tweet about something that happened weeks ago?1 — but I have also made the argument that Twitter just isn’t well suited to direct response advertising in particular:\n\n  Think about the contrast between Twitter and Instagram; both are unique amongst social networks in that they follow a broadcast model: tweets on Twitter and photos on Instagram are public by default, and anyone can follow anyone.

The goal is to mainline information, and Twitter’s speed and information density are unparalleled by anything in the world.

DALL-E 2 can also realistically edit and re-touch photos…</p>\n<p>  DALL-E was created by training a neural network on images and their text descriptions. Through deep learning it not only understands individual objects like koala bears and motorcycles, but learns from relationships between objects, and when you ask DALL-E for an image of a &#8220;koala bear riding a motorcycle&#8221;, it knows how to create that or anything else with a relationship to another object or action.</p>\n<p>  The DALL-E research has three main outcomes: first, it can help people express themselves visually in ways they may not have been able to before.

Third, DALL-E helps humans understand how AI systems see and understand our world.

DALL-E is an example of how imaginative humans and clever systems can work together to make new things, amplifying our creative potential.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That last line may raise some eyebrows: at first glance DALL-E looks poised to compete with artists and illustrators; there is another point of view, though, where DALL-E points towards a major missing piece in a metaverse future.</p>\n<h4>Games and Medium Evolution</h4>\n<p>Games have long been on the forefront of technological development, and that is certainly the case in terms of medium. The first computer games were little more than text:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot from Oregon Trail\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8804\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Images followed, usually of the bitmap variety; I remember playing a lot of &#8220;Where in the world is Carmen San Diego&#8221; at the library:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-1.png?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot from &quot;Where in the world is Carmen San Diego&quot;\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8805\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-1.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-1.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Soon games included motion as you navigated a sprite through a 2D world; 3D followed, and most of the last 25 years has been about making 3D games ever more realistic. Nearly all of those games, though, are 3D images on 2D screens; virtual reality offers the illusion of being inside the game itself.</p>\n<p>Still, this evolution has had challenges: creating ever more realistic 3D games means creating ever more realistic image textures to decorate all of those polygons; this problem is only magnified in virtual reality. This is one of the reasons even open-world games are ultimately limited in scope, and gameplay is largely deterministic: it is through knowing where you are going, and all of your options to get there, that developers can create all of the assets necessary to deliver an immersive experience.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that games can&#8217;t have random elements, above and beyond <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike\">roguelike</a> games that are procedurally generated: the most obvious way to deliver an element of unpredictability is for humans to play each other, albeit in well-defined and controlled environments.</p>\n<h4>Social and User-Generated Content</h4>\n<p>Social networking has undergone a similar medium evolution as games, with a two-decade delay. The earliest forms of social networking on the web were text-based bulletin boards and USENET groups; then came widespread e-mail, AOL chatrooms, and forums. Facebook arrived on the scene in the mid-2000s; one of the things that helped it explode in popularity was the addition of images. Instagram was an image-only social network that soon added video, which is all that TikTok is. And, over the last couple of years in particular, video conferencing through apps like Zoom or Facetime have delivered 3D images on 2D screens.</p>\n<p>Still, medium has always mattered less for social networking, just because the social part of it was so inherently interesting. Humans like communicating with other humans, even if that requires dialing up a random BBS to download messages, composing a reply, and dialing back in to send it. Games may be mostly deterministic, but humans are full of surprises.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this means that social networking is much cheaper: instead of the platform having to generate all of the content, users generate all of the content themselves. This makes it harder to get a new platform off of the ground, because you need users to attract users, but it also makes said platform far stickier than any game (or, to put it another way, the stickiest games have a network effect of their own).</p>\n<h4>Feeds and Algorithms</h4>\n<p>The first iterations of social networking had no particular algorithmic component other than time: newer posts were at the top (or bottom). That changed with Facebook&#8217;s introduction of the News Feed in 2006. Now instead of visiting all of your friends&#8217; pages you could simply browse the feed, which from the very beginning made decisions about what content to include, and in what order.</p>\n<p>Over time the News Feed evolved from a relatively straightforward algorithm to one driven by machine learning, with results so inscrutable that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23004326/facebook-news-feed-downranking-integrity-bug\">it took Facebook six months to fix a recent rankings bug</a>. The impact has been massive: not just Facebook but also Instagram saw huge increases in engagement and increased growth the better their algorithmically-driven feeds became; it was also great for monetization, as the same sort of signals that decided what content you saw also influenced what ads you were presented.</p>\n<p>However, the reason why this discussion of algorithmically-driven feeds is in a different section than social networking is because the ultimate example of their power isn&#8217;t a social network at all: it&#8217;s TikTok. TikTok, of course, is all user-generated content, but the crucial distinction from Facebook is that you aren&#8217;t limited to content from your network: TikTok pulls in the videos it thinks you specifically are most interested in from across its entire network. I explained why this was a blindspot for Facebook <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/\">in 2020</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What is interesting to point out is why it was inevitable that Facebook missed this: first, Facebook views itself first-and-foremost as a social network, so it is disinclined to see that as a liability. Second, that view was reinforced by the way in which Facebook took on Snapchat. The point of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-audacity-of-copying-well/\">The Audacity of Copying Well</a> is that Facebook leveraged Instagram’s social network to halt Snapchat’s growth, which only reinforced that the network was Facebook’s greatest asset, making the TikTok blindspot even larger.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>TikTok combines the zero cost nature of user-generated content with a purely algorithmic feed that is divorced from your network; there is a network effect, in that TikTok needs lots of content to choose from, but it doesn&#8217;t need your specific network.</p>\n<h4>The Machine Learning Metaverse</h4>\n<p>I get that <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/\">metaverses</a> were so 2021, but it strikes me that the examples from science fiction, including <em>Snow Crash</em> and <em>Ready Player One</em>, were very game-like in their implementation. Their virtual worlds were created by visionary corporations or, in the case of the latter, a visionary developer who also included a deterministic game for ultimate ownership of the virtual world. Yes, third parties could and did build experiences with strong social components, most famously Da5id&#8217;s Black Sun club in <em>Snow Crash</em>, but the core mechanic — and the core economics — were closer to a multi-player game than anything else.</p>\n<p>That, though, is exceptionally challenging in the real world: remember, creating games, particularly their art, is expensive, and the expense increases the more immersive the experience is. Social media, on the other hand, is cheap because it uses user-generated content, but that content is generally stuck on more basic mediums — text, pictures, and only recently video. Of course that content doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be limited to your network — an algorithm can deliver anything on the network to any user.</p>\n<p>What is fascinating about DALL-E is that it points to a future where these three trends can be combined. DALL-E, at the end of the day, is ultimately a product of human-generated content, just like its GPT-3 cousin. The latter, of course, is about text, while DALL-E is about images. Notice, though, that progression from text to images; it follows that machine learning-generated video is next. This will likely take several years, of course; video is a much more difficult problem, and responsive 3D environments more difficult yet, but this is a path the industry has trod before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game developers pushed the limits on text, then images, then video, then 3D</li>\n<li>Social media drives content creation costs to zero first on text, then images, then video</li>\n<li>Machine learning models can now create text and images for zero marginal cost</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs.</p>\n<h4>Zero Marginal Content</h4>\n<p>There is another way to think about DALL-E and GPT and similar machine learning models, and it goes back to my longstanding contention that the Internet is a transformational technology matched only by the printing press. What made the latter revolutionary was that it drastically reduced the marginal cost of consumption; from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/\">The Internet and the Third Estate</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Meanwhile, the economics of printing books was fundamentally different from the economics of copying by hand. The latter was purely an operational expense: output was strictly determined by the input of labor. The former, though, was mostly a capital expense: first, to construct the printing press, and second, to set the type for a book. The best way to pay for these significant up-front expenses was to produce as many copies of a particular book that could be sold.</p>\n<p>  How, then, to maximize the number of copies that could be sold? The answer was to print using the most widely used dialect of a particular language, which in turn incentivized people to adopt that dialect, standardizing languages across Europe. That, by extension, deepened the affinities between city-states with shared languages, particularly over decades as a shared culture developed around books and later newspapers. This consolidation occurred at varying rates — England and France several hundred years before Germany and Italy — but in nearly every case the First Estate became not the clergy of the Catholic Church but a national monarch, even as the monarch gave up power to a new kind of meritocratic nobility epitomized by Burke.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Internet has had two effects: the first is to bring the marginal cost of consumption down to zero. Even with the printing press you still needed to print a physical object and distribute it, and that costs money; meanwhile it costs effectively nothing to send this post to anyone in the world who is interested. This has completely upended the publishing industry and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/goodbye-gatekeepers/\">destroyed the power of gatekeepers</a>.</p>\n<p>The other impact, though, has been on the production side; I wrote about TikTok in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/mistakes-and-memes/\">Mistakes and Memes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  That phrase, “Facebook is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who surfaces it”, is oh-so-close to describing TikTok; the error is that the latter is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who <em>creates</em> it…To put it another way, I was too focused on demand — the key to Aggregation Theory — and didn’t think deeply enough about the evolution of supply. User-generated content didn’t have to be simply pictures of pets and political rants from people in one’s network; it could be the foundation of a new kind of network, where the payoff from Metcalfe’s Law is not the number of connections available to any one node, but rather the number of inputs into a customized feed.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Machine learning generated content is just the next step beyond TikTok: instead of pulling content from anywhere on the network, GPT and DALL-E and other similar models generate new content from content, at zero marginal cost. This is how the economics of the metaverse will ultimately make sense: virtual worlds needs virtual content created at virtually zero cost, fully customizable to the individual.</p>\n<p>Of course there are many other issues raised by DALL-E, many of them philosophical in nature; there has already been a lot of discussion of that over the last week, and there should be a lot more. Still, the economic implications matter as well, and after last week&#8217;s announcement the future of the Internet is closer, and weirder, than ever.</p>",

This consolidation occurred at varying rates — England and France several hundred years before Germany and Italy — but in nearly every case the First Estate became not the clergy of the Catholic Church but a national monarch, even as the monarch gave up power to a new kind of meritocratic nobility epitomized by Burke.\n\nThe Internet has had two effects: the first is to bring the marginal cost of consumption down to zero. Even with the printing press you still needed to print a physical object and distribute it, and that costs money; meanwhile it costs effectively nothing to send this post to anyone in the world who is interested. This has completely upended the publishing industry and destroyed the power of gatekeepers.\nThe other impact, though, has been on the production side; I wrote about TikTok in Mistakes and Memes:\n\n  That phrase, “Facebook is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who surfaces it”, is oh-so-close to describing TikTok; the error is that the latter is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who creates it…To put it another way, I was too focused on demand — the key to Aggregation Theory — and didn’t think deeply enough about the evolution of supply. User-generated content didn’t have to be simply pictures of pets and political rants from people in one’s network; it could be the foundation of a new kind of network, where the payoff from Metcalfe’s Law is not the number of connections available to any one node, but rather the number of inputs into a customized feed.\n\nMachine learning generated content is just the next step beyond TikTok: instead of pulling content from anywhere on the network, GPT and DALL-E and other similar models generate new content from content, at zero marginal cost. This is how the economics of the metaverse will ultimately make sense: virtual worlds needs virtual content created at virtually zero cost, fully customizable to the individual.\nOf course there are many other issues raised by DALL-E, many of them philosophical in nature; there has already been a lot of discussion of that over the last week, and there should be a lot more. Still, the economic implications matter as well, and after last week’s announcement the future of the Internet is closer, and weirder, than ever.",

This effort has been underway for about a year, however, well before the slowdown became apparent.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are presented as two different issues, but there is a connection between them: Netflix should be hiring more people — a lot of them — and those people should be building a product that increases subscriber numbers and revenue. That product is advertising.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Business Model: Subscriptions</h4>\n<p>Netflix is, incredibly enough, 24 years old, and a subscription model has served the company well. Not that Netflix had much choice when it started: the company briefly sold DVDs online, before focusing exclusively on renting them; neither approach offered much surface area for advertising, and besides, the subscription model was revolutionary in its own right.</p>\n<p>DVDs-by-mail was, from a certain perspective, inconvenient: you couldn&#8217;t simply drive to your local Blockbuster and peruse the selection; on the other hand, Netflix&#8217;s model gave you access to nearly every movie ever released, not just those in stock at your local store. The real innovation, though, was that business model: instead of paying to rent a DVD and being gouged with late fees, you could pay a set amount each month and keep the DVDs Netflix mailed to you as long as you wanted; send one back to get the next one in your queue.</p>\n<p>Consumers loved it, and Netflix has stuck with the model even as the shift to streaming flipped their value proposition on its head: streaming is even more convenient than hopping in your car, but only a subset of content (ever-expanding, to be sure) is on Netflix. That has been more than enough to fuel Netflix&#8217;s growth; the service had 222 million subscribers at the end of 2021.</p>\n<p>Still, as The Information noted, that number isn&#8217;t increasing as quickly as it used to. Netflix sported over 20% year-over-year subscriber growth for years (usually more than that), but hasn&#8217;t broken the 20% mark since Q4 2020; growth for the last three quarters was in the single digits. Some of that is likely due to growth that was pulled forward by the pandemic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=640%2C352&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Netflix subscriber additions by year\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8365\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=1024%2C563&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=1145%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1145w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The bigger problem, though, is saturation: Netflix has 75 million subscribers in the US and Canada, where there are around 132 million households. That is nearly as many subscribers as linear TV (84 million), and once you consider shared passwords, penetration may be higher. Other markets like India have more room to grow, but much lower household incomes, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/netflix-movies-shows-struggle-to-attract-india-subscribers\">Netflix&#8217;s relatively high prices have been an obstacle</a>.</p>\n<p>Netflix has ways to grow other than subscribers, most obviously by raising prices. The company has done just that on a mostly annual basis for eight years: in the U.S. the price of a Standard subscription (HD, 2 screens) has increased from $7.99 to $15.49. Netflix executives argue that customers don&#8217;t mind because Netflix keeps increasing the amount of content they find compelling; it&#8217;s an argument that is easier to accept when subscriber growth is up-and-to-the-right. Now the task is to keep raising prices while ensuring subscriber numbers don&#8217;t start going in the opposite direction.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s New Initiative: Gaming</h4>\n<p>To accomplish this Netflix is not only continuing to invest in original programming, but also branching out into new kinds of content, including games. This may seem an odd idea at first: sure, Netflix is generating some new IP, but it would generally be much easier to license that IP than to become proficient at gaming. Netflix, though, believes it has a unique advantage when it comes to gaming: its business model. Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said in the company&#8217;s Q2 2021 <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Netflix,-Inc.,-Q2-2021-Pre-Recorded-Earnings-Call,-Jul-20,-2021.pdf\">earnings interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Our subscription model yields some opportunities to focus on a set of game experiences that are currently underserved by the sort of dominant monetization models and games. We don’t have to think about ads. We don’t have to think about in-game purchases or other monetization. We don’t have to think about per-title purchases. Really, we can do what we’ve been doing on the movie and series side, which is just hyper laser-focused on delivering the most entertaining game experiences that we can. So we’re finding that many game developers really like that concept and that focus and this idea of being able to put all of their creative energy into just great gameplay and not having to worry about those other considerations that they have typically had to trade off with just making compelling games.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Netflix&#8217;s gaming efforts to date have been fairly limited; the company <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile\">launched with five titles in November</a>, but the fact the company has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/netflix-game-studio.html\">bought three gaming studios</a> suggests a strong appetite for more — at least amongst Netflix executives.</p>\n<p>But what about consumers?</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Job: TV</h4>\n<p>Consumers don&#8217;t care so much about business models; they have jobs that they want to get done, and the traditional cable bundle used to do a whole bunch of jobs: information gathering, education, sports, story-telling, escapism, background noise, and more. As I noted in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/\">The Great Unbundling</a>, these jobs are increasingly done by completely different services: we get news on the Internet, education from YouTube, story-telling from streaming services, etc.</p>\n<p>Netflix is obviously one of those streaming services, but the company is also investing in movies (escapism), and is increasingly the default choice when it comes to the under-appreciated &#8220;background noise&#8221; category: the service has oceans of low-brow content ready to be streamed while you are barely paying attention. This is a big reason why for many people their choice of streaming services is a matter of which service do they subscribe to in addition to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Still, all of these jobs are about passively consuming content; from a consumer perspective gaming is something different, in that you are an active participant. To that end, it&#8217;s not clear to me why consumers would even think to consider Netflix when it comes to gaming: that&#8217;s not what the service&#8217;s job is, nor was it the job of the linear TV bundle that Netflix is helping replace.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Market: Attention</h4>\n<p>Then again, as founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings likes to say, Netflix&#8217;s competition is much broader than TV; Hastings wrote in the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://q4live.s22.clientfiles.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2018/q4/01/FINAL-Q4-18-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">Q4 letter to shareholders</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time and less than that of mobile screen time. In 2 other countries, we earn a lower percentage of screen time due to lower penetration of our service. We earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors. We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time. Hulu is small compared to YouTube for viewing time, and they are successful in the US, but non-existent in Canada, which creates a comparison point: our penetration in the two countries is pretty similar. There are thousands of competitors in this highly-fragmented market vying to entertain consumers and low barriers to entry for those with great experiences. Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose. Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hastings&#8217; point was that analysts should not be overly focused on the threat posed by other streaming services; Netflix has been fighting for attention for years. This is correct, by the way: thanks to the Internet everything from television to social networking to gaming can be delivered at zero marginal cost; the only scarce resource is time, which means attention is the only thing that needs to be competed for.</p>\n<p>Well, that and money: companies competing for customer money need a way to communicate to customers what they have to sell and why it is compelling; that means advertising, and advertising requires attention. It follows, then, that the most effective business model in the attention economy is advertising: if customers rely on Google or Facebook to navigate the abundance of content that is the result of zero marginal costs, then it is Google and Facebook that are the best-placed to sell effective ads.</p>\n<p>Notice, though, the trouble this Internet reality presents to Netflix: if content is abundant and attention is scarce, it&#8217;s easier to sell attention than content; Netflix&#8217;s business model, though, is the exact opposite.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Differentiation: Unique Content</h4>\n<p>Netflix, of course, sees this as a differentiator, and for a long time it was: linear TV had commercials, while Netflix had none. Linear TV made you wait for your favorite show, while Netflix gave you entire seasons at once. This was particularly compelling when Netflix had similar content to linear TV: why would you put up with commercials and TV schedules when you could just stream what you wanted to?</p>\n<p>However, as more and more content has moved away from TV and to competing streaming services, differentiation is no longer based on the user experience, but rather uniqueness; on-demand no-commercials is no longer unique, but <em>Stranger Things</em> can only be found on Netflix.</p>\n<p>Here Netflix&#8217;s biggest advantage is the sheer size of its subscriber base: Netflix can, on an absolute basis, pay more than its streaming competitors for the content it wants, even as its per-subscriber cost basis is lower. This advantage is only accentuated the larger Netflix&#8217;s subscriber base gets, and the more revenue it makes per subscriber; the user experience of getting to that unique content doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>All of these factors make a compelling case for Netflix to start building an advertising business.</p>\n<p>First, an advertising-supported or subsidized tier would expand Netflix&#8217;s subscriber base, which is not only good for the company&#8217;s long-term growth prospects, but also competitive position when it comes to acquiring content. This also applies to the company&#8217;s recent attempts to crack down on password sharing, and struggles in the developing world: an advertising-based tier is a much more accessible alternative.</p>\n<p>Second, advertising would make it easier for Netflix to continue to raise prices: on one hand, it would provide an alternative for marginal customers who might otherwise churn, and on the other hand, it would create a new benefit for those willing to pay (i.e. no advertising for the highest tiers).</p>\n<p>Third, advertising is a natural fit for the jobs Netflix does. Sure, customers enjoy watching shows without ads — and again, they can continue to pay for that — but filler TV, which Netflix also specializes in, is just as easily filled with ads.</p>\n<p>Above all, though, is the fact that advertising is a great opportunity that aligns with Netflix&#8217;s business: while the company once won with a differentiated user experience worth paying for, today Netflix demands scarce attention because of its investment in unique content. That attention can be sold, and should be, particularly as it increases Netflix&#8217;s ability to invest in more unique content, and/or charge higher prices to its user base.</p>\n<p>This, I will note, is an about face for me; I&#8217;ve long been skeptical that Netflix would ever sell advertising, or that they should. The former may still be warranted, particularly in light of Netflix&#8217;s gaming initiative. This feels like solipsism: Netflix&#8217;s executives think a lot about their business model, so they are looking for growth opportunities that seem to leverage said business model; I&#8217;m not convinced, though, that customers appreciate or care about the differentiation that Netflix claims to be leveraging in gaming, whereas they would appreciate lower prices for streaming, and already have the expectation for ads on TV.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, subscriber growth has stalled, even as the advertising market has proven to be much larger than even Google or Facebook can cover. Moreover, the post-ATT world is freeing up more money for the sort of top-of-funnel advertising that would probably be the norm on a Netflix advertising service. In short, the opportunity is there, the product is right, and the business need is pressing in a way it wasn&#8217;t previously.</p>\n<p>Of course this would be a lot of work, and a big shift in Netflix&#8217;s well-defined value proposition; Netflix, though, has made big shifts before: the entire reason why advertising is a possibility is because Netflix is a streamer, not a DVD mailer. In that view a new (additional) business model is just <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/netflixs-new-rung-self-production-cash-flow-and-margin-netflixs-new-rung/\">another rung</a> on <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/netflix-goes-global-iphone-worry/\">Netflix&#8217;s ladder</a>.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-not-sell-ads-elon-musk-and-twitter/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>",

Well, there needs to be a filter in between, what people call the personalized internet, but basically an AI, a recommender system.

      "content_html": "<p>One of the most amazing things about the Internet is how it provides a level playing field for everyone: this post that you are reading was written by a single person, and it is just as accessible as an article written by the New York Times, or a proclamation issued by the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>It used to be that media organizations had a big advantage by virtue of owning printing presses and delivery trucks, or broadcast licenses; celebrities and politicians would have their proclamations carried across those same mediums by virtue of their popularity or power. The same advantages applied to other areas of the economy like retail and consumer packaged goods: building physical stores is a big barrier of entry if you want to be the former, and having a large and popular set of products gave big companies access to those retail channels.</p>\n<p>What is common to both examples was the importance of controlling physical space, but that control came with inherent limitations: a paper newspaper could not be delivered everywhere, and TV broadcasts were limited by the signal strength of broadcast towers. Stores had to be built, and packaged goods had to be stocked on shelves.</p>\n<p>The Internet changes all of that: now articles and videos are simply digital bits, easily created and easily transmitted anywhere on the globe, effectively for free. Physical goods still need to be made, but they can be sold to anyone by anyone, and shelf space has been replaced by the commoditized cardboard box.</p>\n<p>This first order reality, though, has had a multitude of second order effects. Newspapers, for example, were amongst the first online sites, and it seemed like a massive boon: now an article that was only accessible by those within a limited geographic area delineated by the reach of delivery trucks could be read by anyone in the world.

For your typical newspaper, though, the competitive environment is diametrically opposed to what they are used to: instead of there being a scarce amount of published material, there is an overwhelming abundance. More importantly, this shift in the competitive environment has fundamentally changed just who has economic power.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article was one of the first articulations of the concepts undergirding <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>, which is downstream from the shift from geographic-driven scarcity to Internet-driven abundance: now the most valuable companies in the world were those that helped users navigate abundance, whether that be via search (Google), contacts (Facebook), or retail (Amazon).</p>\n<h4>The Current Thing Meme</h4>\n<p>Most of my discussion of Aggregation Theory has been about economics and concepts like zero marginal costs; just as it doesn&#8217;t cost anything to publish, it doesn&#8217;t cost Google anything (on a marginal basis) to help every person in the world find the specific piece of content they are looking for. This, by extension, motivates publishers to work well with Google, motivates users to use Google more, and gives Google the best possible opportunity to show ads, attracting more and more advertising.</p>\n<p>In other words, centralization is a second order effect of decentralization: when all constraints on content are removed, more power than ever accrues to the entity that is the preferred choice for navigating that content; moreover, that power compounds on itself in a virtuous feedback loop.</p>\n<p>This dynamic, though, goes beyond economics; consider the meme that inspired the title of this Article:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/CfoJ3qdCRJ\">pic.twitter.com/CfoJ3qdCRJ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503276966874595330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>This meme has, for rather obvious reasons, made a fair number of people upset, particularly to the extent it suggests that support for a country fighting for its existence in the face of a brutal invasion is somehow inauthentic. I think, though, that interpretation is too literal; after all, the meme can be extended in lots of different ways:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I support the current thing. <a href=\"https://t.co/e3WIeV6FHp\">pic.twitter.com/e3WIeV6FHp</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1504238641475821570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>What I think is captured here is orthogonal to the actual issue at hand (in the case of Musk&#8217;s version, Ukraine); the entire point of the generic labeling (&#8220;The Current Thing&#8221;) is that there is a dynamic that exists independent of the issue being critiqued, and my contention in this Article is that said dynamic is Aggregation Theory for ideas.</p>\n<h4>Aggregating Ideas</h4>\n<p>Go back to the point about the explosion of content on the Internet: the first order implication is that there is an explosion of ideas; after all, anyone can publish anything. Presumably this means that there are far more categories of thought than ever before! And, if you dig deep enough into the Internet, this is true.</p>\n<p>Most people, though, don&#8217;t dig that deep, just as they don&#8217;t dig that deep for content or contacts or commerce: it&#8217;s just far easier and more convenient to rely on Google or Facebook or Amazon. Why wouldn&#8217;t this same dynamic apply to ideas? Being informed about everything happening in the world is hard if not impossible: humans evolved to care intensely about what happened in their local environment; however, first mass media, and then the Internet, brought news from everywhere to our immediate attention.</p>\n<p>Given that, it seems entirely reasonable — expected even — that we all outsource our intuition for what events matter, and what our position on those events should be, to the most convenient option, especially if that option has obvious moral valence. Police brutality against people of color is obviously bad; people dying from COVID is obviously bad; Russia invading Ukraine is obviously bad; why wouldn&#8217;t each of us snap into opposition to obviously bad things?</p>\n<p>This dynamic is exactly what the meme highlights: sure, the Internet makes possible a wide range of viewpoints — you can absolutely find critics of Black Lives Matter, COVID policies, or pro-Ukraine policies — but the Internet, thanks to its lack of friction and instant feedback loops, also makes nearly every position but the dominant one untenable. If everyone believes one thing, the costs of believing something else increase dramatically, making the consensus opinion the only viable option; this is the same dynamic in which publishers become dependent on Google or Facebook, or retailers on Amazon, just because that is where money can be made.</p>\n<p>Again, to be very clear, that does not mean the opinion is wrong; as I noted, I think the resonance of this meme is orthogonal to the rightness of the position it is critiquing, and is instead concerned with the sense that there is something unique about the depth of sentiment surrounding issues that don&#8217;t necessarily apply in any real-life way to the people feeling said sentiment.</p>\n<h4>Righteousness and Dissent</h4>\n<p>Here I think it is useful to go back to economics. The more that an entity becomes dependent on an Aggregator, the more perilous the economic outlook for said entity. If you depend on Google or Facebook for traffic, or Amazon for sales, the more liable you are to <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/\">have your margin consumed by said entities</a>. A truly sustainable business model depends on being able to connect to your customers on your own terms, not an Aggregator’s.</p>\n<p>A similar critique can be made of ideas; I thought this tweet was very well-stated:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Putin&#39;s array of yes men convincing him his military was far more capable than it actually was and Xi&#39;s propaganda campaign against Western mRNA vaccines forcing him to rely on COVID Zero are powerful reminders that, as messy as it can be, an open democratic discourse is superior</p>\n<p>&mdash; Armand Domalewski (@ArmandDoma) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArmandDoma/status/1504220528265027592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>It is very counter-intuitive to see how &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas are in fact extremely valuable: not only do they highlight why the good ideas are better, but they also sometimes show that the &#8220;good&#8221; ideas are in fact wrong. Arguing that the earth was not the center of the universe was once a &#8220;bad&#8221; idea; it was also correct. At the same time, to think that the Catholic church of 500 years ago was the only time where the dominant mode of thinking clearly missed the mark seems exceptionally arrogant; we rightly believe that allowing room for dissidents was, in the past, a good thing. It seems clear to me that doing the same today is likely to prove more valuable than not.</p>\n<p>Here is the problem: it turns out it was much easier to believe in the value of dissidents in a world of meaningful marginal costs for the propagation of ideas. Most people never encountered contrary opinions when spreading said opinions entailed publishing them on paper and spreading them in the physical world; on the Internet, on the other hand, bad ideas are <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/zero-trust-information/\">only a search away</a>. Moreover, the means by which to suppress those opinions are far more obvious: instead of having to shut down a printing press, one only needs to pressure those same centralized Aggregators that arose for economic reasons to suppress &#8220;wrong&#8221; speech.</p>\n<p>The end result is a world where the ability for anyone to post any idea has, paradoxically, meant far greater mass adoption of popular ideas and far more effective suppression of &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas.

Internet service providers, though, are about access — having the opportunity to speak or hear in the first place. In other words, the further down the stack, the more legality should be the sole criteria for moderation; the further up the more discretion and even responsibility there should be for content:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-moderation/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?resize=640%2C404&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The Position In the Stack Matters for Moderation\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4319\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?resize=996%2C630&amp;ssl=1 996w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stratechery-2019-08-07-20.42.32.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  Note the implications for Facebook and YouTube in particular: their moderation decisions should not be viewed in the context of free speech, but rather as discretionary decisions made by managers seeking to attract the broadest customer base; the appropriate regulatory response, if one is appropriate, should be to push for more competition so that those dissatisfied with Facebook or Google’s moderation policies can go elsewhere.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In this view the decision of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22962822/internet-backbone-provider-cogent-shuts-off-service-russia\">Cogent</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/another-us-internet-backbone-provider-cuts-service-with-russia\">Lumen</a> to cut-off backbone capacity to Russia feels like a mistake.

      "content_text": "One of the most amazing things about the Internet is how it provides a level playing field for everyone: this post that you are reading was written by a single person, and it is just as accessible as an article written by the New York Times, or a proclamation issued by the President of the United States.\nIt used to be that media organizations had a big advantage by virtue of owning printing presses and delivery trucks, or broadcast licenses; celebrities and politicians would have their proclamations carried across those same mediums by virtue of their popularity or power. The same advantages applied to other areas of the economy like retail and consumer packaged goods: building physical stores is a big barrier of entry if you want to be the former, and having a large and popular set of products gave big companies access to those retail channels.\nWhat is common to both examples was the importance of controlling physical space, but that control came with inherent limitations: a paper newspaper could not be delivered everywhere, and TV broadcasts were limited by the signal strength of broadcast towers. Stores had to be built, and packaged goods had to be stocked on shelves.\nThe Internet changes all of that: now articles and videos are simply digital bits, easily created and easily transmitted anywhere on the globe, effectively for free. Physical goods still need to be made, but they can be sold to anyone by anyone, and shelf space has been replaced by the commoditized cardboard box.\nThis first order reality, though, has had a multitude of second order effects. Newspapers, for example, were amongst the first online sites, and it seemed like a massive boon: now an article that was only accessible by those within a limited geographic area delineated by the reach of delivery trucks could be read by anyone in the world. The problem is that that same reach was available to everyone; back in 2014 I wrote in Economic Power in the Age of Abundance:1\n\n  One of the great paradoxes for newspapers today is that their financial prospects are inversely correlated to their addressable market. Even as advertising revenues have fallen off a cliff — adjusted for inflation, ad revenues are at the same level as the 1950s — newspapers are able to reach audiences not just in their hometowns but literally all over the world.\n  \n  The problem for publishers, though, is that the free distribution provided by the Internet is not an exclusive. It’s available to every other newspaper as well. Moreover, it’s also available to publishers of any type, even bloggers like myself.\n  \n  To be clear, this is absolutely a boon, particularly for readers, but also for any writer looking to have a broad impact. For your typical newspaper, though, the competitive environment is diametrically opposed to what they are used to: instead of there being a scarce amount of published material, there is an overwhelming abundance. More importantly, this shift in the competitive environment has fundamentally changed just who has economic power.\n\nThat article was one of the first articulations of the concepts undergirding Aggregation Theory, which is downstream from the shift from geographic-driven scarcity to Internet-driven abundance: now the most valuable companies in the world were those that helped users navigate abundance, whether that be via search (Google), contacts (Facebook), or retail (Amazon).\nThe Current Thing Meme\nMost of my discussion of Aggregation Theory has been about economics and concepts like zero marginal costs; just as it doesn’t cost anything to publish, it doesn’t cost Google anything (on a marginal basis) to help every person in the world find the specific piece of content they are looking for. This, by extension, motivates publishers to work well with Google, motivates users to use Google more, and gives Google the best possible opportunity to show ads, attracting more and more advertising.\nIn other words, centralization is a second order effect of decentralization: when all constraints on content are removed, more power than ever accrues to the entity that is the preferred choice for navigating that content; moreover, that power compounds on itself in a virtuous feedback loop.\nThis dynamic, though, goes beyond economics; consider the meme that inspired the title of this Article:\n\n\npic.twitter.com/CfoJ3qdCRJ\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2022\n \nThis meme has, for rather obvious reasons, made a fair number of people upset, particularly to the extent it suggests that support for a country fighting for its existence in the face of a brutal invasion is somehow inauthentic. I think, though, that interpretation is too literal; after all, the meme can be extended in lots of different ways:\n\n\nI support the current thing. pic.twitter.com/e3WIeV6FHp\n— Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) March 16, 2022\n \nWhat I think is captured here is orthogonal to the actual issue at hand (in the case of Musk’s version, Ukraine); the entire point of the generic labeling (“The Current Thing”) is that there is a dynamic that exists independent of the issue being critiqued, and my contention in this Article is that said dynamic is Aggregation Theory for ideas.\nAggregating Ideas\nGo back to the point about the explosion of content on the Internet: the first order implication is that there is an explosion of ideas; after all, anyone can publish anything. Presumably this means that there are far more categories of thought than ever before! And, if you dig deep enough into the Internet, this is true.\nMost people, though, don’t dig that deep, just as they don’t dig that deep for content or contacts or commerce: it’s just far easier and more convenient to rely on Google or Facebook or Amazon. Why wouldn’t this same dynamic apply to ideas? Being informed about everything happening in the world is hard if not impossible: humans evolved to care intensely about what happened in their local environment; however, first mass media, and then the Internet, brought news from everywhere to our immediate attention.\nGiven that, it seems entirely reasonable — expected even — that we all outsource our intuition for what events matter, and what our position on those events should be, to the most convenient option, especially if that option has obvious moral valence. Police brutality against people of color is obviously bad; people dying from COVID is obviously bad; Russia invading Ukraine is obviously bad; why wouldn’t each of us snap into opposition to obviously bad things?\nThis dynamic is exactly what the meme highlights: sure, the Internet makes possible a wide range of viewpoints — you can absolutely find critics of Black Lives Matter, COVID policies, or pro-Ukraine policies — but the Internet, thanks to its lack of friction and instant feedback loops, also makes nearly every position but the dominant one untenable. If everyone believes one thing, the costs of believing something else increase dramatically, making the consensus opinion the only viable option; this is the same dynamic in which publishers become dependent on Google or Facebook, or retailers on Amazon, just because that is where money can be made.\nAgain, to be very clear, that does not mean the opinion is wrong; as I noted, I think the resonance of this meme is orthogonal to the rightness of the position it is critiquing, and is instead concerned with the sense that there is something unique about the depth of sentiment surrounding issues that don’t necessarily apply in any real-life way to the people feeling said sentiment.\nRighteousness and Dissent\nHere I think it is useful to go back to economics. The more that an entity becomes dependent on an Aggregator, the more perilous the economic outlook for said entity. If you depend on Google or Facebook for traffic, or Amazon for sales, the more liable you are to have your margin consumed by said entities. A truly sustainable business model depends on being able to connect to your customers on your own terms, not an Aggregator’s.\nA similar critique can be made of ideas; I thought this tweet was very well-stated:\n\n\nPutin's array of yes men convincing him his military was far more capable than it actually was and Xi's propaganda campaign against Western mRNA vaccines forcing him to rely on COVID Zero are powerful reminders that, as messy as it can be, an open democratic discourse is superior\n— Armand Domalewski (@ArmandDoma) March 16, 2022\n \nIt is very counter-intuitive to see how “bad” ideas are in fact extremely valuable: not only do they highlight why the good ideas are better, but they also sometimes show that the “good” ideas are in fact wrong. Arguing that the earth was not the center of the universe was once a “bad” idea; it was also correct. At the same time, to think that the Catholic church of 500 years ago was the only time where the dominant mode of thinking clearly missed the mark seems exceptionally arrogant; we rightly believe that allowing room for dissidents was, in the past, a good thing. It seems clear to me that doing the same today is likely to prove more valuable than not.\nHere is the problem: it turns out it was much easier to believe in the value of dissidents in a world of meaningful marginal costs for the propagation of ideas. Most people never encountered contrary opinions when spreading said opinions entailed publishing them on paper and spreading them in the physical world; on the Internet, on the other hand, bad ideas are only a search away. Moreover, the means by which to suppress those opinions are far more obvious: instead of having to shut down a printing press, one only needs to pressure those same centralized Aggregators that arose for economic reasons to suppress “wrong” speech.\nThe end result is a world where the ability for anyone to post any idea has, paradoxically, meant far greater mass adoption of popular ideas and far more effective suppression of “bad” ideas. That is invigorating when one feels the dominant idea is righteous; it seems reasonable to worry about the potential of said sense of righteousness overwhelming the consideration of whether particular courses of action are actually good or bad.\nModeration Frameworks\nIn 2019 I wrote an Article entitled A Framework for Moderation, which argued for a finely-tuned examination of the Internet stack as a driver of moderation decisions:\n\n  It makes sense to think about these positions of the stack very differently: the top of the stack is about broadcasting — reaching as many people as possible — and while you may have the right to say anything you want, there is no right to be heard. Internet service providers, though, are about access — having the opportunity to speak or hear in the first place. In other words, the further down the stack, the more legality should be the sole criteria for moderation; the further up the more discretion and even responsibility there should be for content:\n  \n  Note the implications for Facebook and YouTube in particular: their moderation decisions should not be viewed in the context of free speech, but rather as discretionary decisions made by managers seeking to attract the broadest customer base; the appropriate regulatory response, if one is appropriate, should be to push for more competition so that those dissatisfied with Facebook or Google’s moderation policies can go elsewhere.\n\nIn this view the decision of Cogent and Lumen to cut-off backbone capacity to Russia feels like a mistake. Both companies are the very definition of infrastructure, with no user-facing presence; it follows that they should not be making any decisions based on political considerations (with Carl von Clausewitz’s observation that “war is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means” in mind).\nAnd yet they have cut off Russia all the same, along with a whole host of Western companies. To be very clear, I get it: what Russia is doing to Ukraine is wrong, above and beyond the significant economic challenges in serving a country hit with the most comprehensive set of sanctions in history.\nAt the same time, I can’t help but worry about a world where every level of the Internet stack feels empowered to act based on political considerations, and it makes me think that my Framework for Moderation was wrong.

      "summary": "The reaction to the Ukraine invasion has been a demonstration of tech capabilities; those capabilities may be the key to compelling China to pressure Russia.",
      "content_html": "<p>While it has been only 11 days since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is already clear that the long-term impact on the tech industry is going to be substantial. The goal of this Article is to explore what those implications might be.</p>\n<p>Let me start with some caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, while I presume it goes without saying, I condemn Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.</li>\n<li>Second, the situation is obviously extremely fluid. My goal is to write about impacts that seem likely to endure, but some issues, particularly those involving China, could shift considerably.</li>\n<li>Third, the long-term is inherently difficult to predict. Nearly every major event that has has happened over the last several years, from Donald Trump&#8217;s election, to COVID, to this invasion, was not only not anticipated by most people, but was in fact dismissed even after there were signs in place that they might occur. So take all of this with the appropriate grain of salt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important thing to make clear about this Article, though, is that much of it is focused on <em>capabilities</em>, not <em>intentions.</em> In much of our daily life we rely on the good intentions of others, even if they have dangerous capabilities. One mundane example is traffic on a two-way street: oncoming cars have the capability of swerving into my lane and hitting me head-on; I trust that they do not intend to do so. There are a whole host of similar examples, for good reason: societies that trust each other&#8217;s intentions function much more smoothly and efficiently; no one wants every single street to be built with concrete dividers between traffic.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world international relations would work the same way, and there is an argument that much of the prosperity of the last few decades has been driven by the sort of increased trust and interconnectedness that comes from assuming the good intentions of other countries — or at a minimum enlightened self-interest — leading to increased economic efficiency for everyone engaged in global trade. In this arena, though, the question of capabilities is never far from the surface: what can one country do to another, should the intentions of the first country change, and what must the second country do to ameliorate that risk? And here there is very much a tech angle.</p>\n<h4>Public Versus Private Sanctions</h4>\n<p>In response to the invasion Western governments unleashed an unprecedented set of sanctions on Russia; these sanctions were primarily financial in nature, and included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disconnecting sanctioned Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system</li>\n<li>Cutting off the Russian Central Bank from foreign currency reserves held in the West</li>\n<li>Identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned Russian individuals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sanctions, which were announced last weekend, led to the crashing of the ruble and the ongoing closure of the Russian stock market, and are expected to wreak havoc on the Russian economy; now the U.S. and E.U. are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-europeans-discussing-banning-russian-oil-imports-blinken-says-2022-03-06/\">discussing banning imports of Russian oil</a>.</p>\n<p>This Article is not about those public sanctions, by which I mean sanctions coming from governments (Noah Smith has a useful overview of their impact <a href=\"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/how-are-the-big-sanctions-hurting\">here</a>); what is interesting to me is the extent to which these public sanctions have been accompanied by <em>private</em> sanctions by companies, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-says-it-has-stopped-all-product-sales-in-russia-11646169327\">stopped selling its products</a> in Russia (although still operates the App Store).</li>\n<li>Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/03/04/microsoft-suspends-russia-sales-ukraine-conflict/\">has suspended</a> all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia, and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/02/oracle_and_sap_suspend_business/\">SAP and Oracle</a> have suspended operations.</li>\n<li>Google and Facebook <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/google-suspends-all-advertising-in-russia-.html\">suspended all advertising</a> in Russia.</li>\n<li>Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, EA, and CD Projekt <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-epic-games-pause-game-sales-russia-201856440.html\">suspended game sales</a> in Russia.</li>\n<li>Disney, Sony, and Warner Bros. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/disney-pausing-film-releases-russia-over-ukraine-invasion-2022-03-01/\">paused film releases</a> in Russia, and Netflix <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/netflix-suspends-service-russia-ukraine-invasion-1235197390/\">suspended its service</a>.</li>\n<li>Visa and Mastercard <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-05/visa-suspends-all-russia-operations-l0eegccn\">cut off Russia</a> from their respective international payment networks, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/paypal-shuts-down-its-services-russia-citing-ukraine-aggression-2022-03-05/\">PayPal suspended service</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-04/samsung-suspends-shipments-of-phones-chips-to-russia\">Samsung</a> stopped selling phones and chips, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/619357/amd-officially-halts-chip-sales-to-russia.html\">Nvidia, Intel, and AMD</a> also stopped selling chips to Russia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an incomplete list! The key thing to note, though, is few if any of these actions were required by law; they were decisions made by individual companies.</p>\n<p>This, though, is where the <em>intentions</em> versus <em>capabilities</em> distinction arises, in two different respects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the public/private distinction that I just noted may not be so apparent to people outside of the U.S. or the West generally; one could certainly understand how other countries might interpret this collection of public and private sanctions as being different parts of a single whole. To that end, this collection of actions demonstrates the capability of effectively wiping an economy off of the map.</li>\n<li>Second, to the extent that the public/private distinction is understood, it highlights the capability of private companies to impose sanctions, and their willingness to do so in pursuit of political goals — even if those political goals are to stop an unjust invasion and save lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I suspect that both of these interpretations matter and will have long-reaching effects, in part because they are not a new trend, but a continuation of an ongoing one.</p>\n<h4>Internet 3.0 and the Rise of Politics</h4>\n<p>Last January I wrote an article entitled <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/\">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History</a> that argued that technology broadly has passed through two eras: 1.0 was the technological era, and 2.0 was the economic era.</p>\n<p>The technological era was defined by the creation of the technical building blocks and protocols that undergird the Internet; there were few economic incentives beyond building products that people might want to buy, in part because few thought there was any money to be made on the Internet. That changed during the 2000s, as it became increasingly clear that the Internet provided massive returns to scale in a way that benefited both Aggregators and their customers. I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Google was founded in 1998, in the middle of the dot-com bubble, but it was the company’s IPO in 2004 that, to my mind, marked the beginning of Internet 2.0. This period of the Internet was about the economics of zero friction; specifically, unlike the assumptions that undergird Internet 1.0, it turned out that the Internet does not disperse economic power but in fact centralizes it. This is what undergirds <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>: when services compete without the constraints of geography or marginal costs, dominance is achieved by controlling demand, not supply, and winners take most.</p>\n<p>  Aggregators like Google and Facebook weren’t the only winners though; the smartphone market was so large that it could sustain a duopoly of two platforms with multi-sided networks of developers, users, and OEMs (in the case of Android; Apple was both OEM and platform provider for iOS). Meanwhile, public cloud providers could provide back-end servers for companies of all types, with scale economics that not only lowered costs and increased flexibility, but which also justified far more investments in R&amp;D that were immediately deployable by said companies.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is no economic reason to ever leave this era, which leads many to assume we never will; services that are centralized work better for more people more cheaply, leaving no obvious product vector on which non-centralized alternatives are better. The exception is politics, and the point of that Article was to argue that we were entering a new era: the political era.</p>\n<p>Go back to the two points I raised above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a country, corporation, or individual assumes that the tech platforms of another country are acting in concert with their enemy, they are highly motivated to pursue alternatives to those tech platforms even if those platforms work better, are more popular, are cheaper, etc.</li>\n<li>If a country, corporation, or individual assumes that tech platforms are themselves engaged in political action, they are highly motivated to pursue alternatives to those tech platforms even if those platforms work better, are more popular, are cheaper, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, just to be crystal clear, these takeaways are true even if the intentions are pure, and the actions are just, because the question at hand is not about <em>intentions</em> but about <em>capabilities</em>. And while I get it can be hard to appreciate that distinction in the case of a situation like Ukraine, it&#8217;s worth noting that similar takeaways could be drawn from de-platforming controversies after January 6 and the attempts to control misinformation during COVID; if anything the fact that there are multiple object lessons in recent history of the willingness of platforms to both act in concert with governments and also of their own volition emphasizes the fact that from a realist perspective capabilities matter more than intentions, because the willingness to exercise those capabilities (to a widely varying degree, to be sure) has not been constrained to a single case.</p>\n<h4>India and Sanctions</h4>\n<p>The two countries where these questions are likely to loom largest are China and India.</p>\n<p>Start with the latter: India is widely considered the most important long-term growth market for a whole host of tech companies, thanks to its massive population that is only just now coming online, combined with a growing economy that, to the extent it can follow a similar path to China, promises more opportunity than anywhere else in the world. In the economic era it has made perfect sense for India to be a core market for Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.</p>\n<p>It was India, though, that raised some of the most strident objections to Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s decision to take down President Trump&#8217;s accounts after January 6, with several politicians pointing out that tech executives in San Francisco could do the same to them; in the case of the Ukraine invasion India is staying neutral, thanks in part to its significantly longer-term relationship with Russia, particularly from a military perspective. That makes it all-the-more likely that the aforementioned private sanctions are being interpreted in terms of capabilities, not intentions, clouding the long-term prospects of those tech companies counting on India for growth.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this isn&#8217;t an abstract idea for India: the country&#8217;s nuclear program was started in response to India&#8217;s defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War, but the country&#8217;s first nuclear test in 1974 led to sanctions from the United States, as did far more extensive tests in 1998. The United States also sailed a fleet into the Bay of Bengal during a conflict with Pakistan in 1971, shortly after India signed a treaty with the USSR, and the fleet was there to oppose India, not to support it. This matters not because it excuses India&#8217;s neutrality in the current conflict, but to explain why these private sanctions from U.S. tech companies may have different interpretations and unintended consequences in a market they were counting on.</p>\n<p>China is in a very different position, thanks to the long-run effects of the Great Firewall: U.S. consumer services companies obviously can&#8217;t sanction China, because China has already blocked them and built its own alternatives (one does wonder to what extent Moscow and perhaps even New Delhi look at the Great Firewall with jealousy). China&#8217;s problem — and potentially the West&#8217;s opportunity — lies with a far more fundamental piece of technology: semiconductors.</p>\n<h4>Semiconductors and China</h4>\n<p>China&#8217;s leading semiconductor foundry is the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — SMIC for short. While the majority of SMIC&#8217;s volume is on older 55nm and 65nm process nodes, the company has a sizable and growing business at the extremely popular 28nm node. The company has also recently started mass production of 14nm and has demonstrated the ability to build 7nm chips. Even so, the most cutting edge companies in China have long been used to buying their chips abroad, whether that be Intel chips for servers or contracting with TSMC for everything else.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration took square aim at both vectors: in the case of the latter all American chip companies and companies that relied on American technology — which is to say, all of them, including TSMC — were barred from selling to Huawei, effectively killing the company&#8217;s smartphone business and severely damaging its telecom business. SMIC, meanwhile, has been barred from acquiring ASML&#8217;s cutting-edge extreme ultroviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are essential for building 7nm and below chips cost-effectively.</p>\n<p>What is notable in terms of this conflict is that China has given every appearance of supporting Russia (although the country, like India, abstained from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/un-general-assembly-set-censure-russia-over-ukraine-invasion-2022-03-02/\">the United Nations motion</a> to condemn Russia&#8217;s invasion). The big question in terms of Russian sanctions is just how far this support will go: on the one hand, working with Russia <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-chinas-banks-wont-come-to-russias-rescue-11646389803\">risks sanctions in the West</a>, which is a much larger market for China; this is a big deterrent for SMIC, which has a big opportunity to undercut TSMC in price on trailing edge nodes. Seizing that opportunity means sanctioning Russia; from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-01/u-s-expects-chinese-tech-firms-to-help-choke-off-russia-supply\">Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Washington is expected to lean on major Chinese companies from Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to Lenovo Group Ltd. to join U.S.-led sanctions against Russia, aiming to cripple the country’s ability to buy key technologies and components. China is Russia’s biggest supplier of electronics, accounting for a third of its semiconductor imports and more than half of its computers and smartphones. Beijing has opposed the increasingly severe measures that the U.S. has taken to restrict Russia’s trade and economy in response to its invasion of Ukraine, however U.S. officials expect tech suppliers such as SMIC to uphold the new rules and curtail trade of sensitive technology with American origin, especially as it relates to Russia’s defense sector.</p>\n<p>  Any items produced with certain U.S. inputs, including American software and designs, are subject to the ban, even if they are made overseas, a U.S. official told Bloomberg News on Monday. Companies that attempt to evade these new controls would face the prospect of themselves being cut off from U.S.-origin technology and corporate executives risk going to jail for violations…Beijing has made self-sufficiency in the semiconductor sector a national priority, but for now its tech companies still rely heavily on U.S. designs and technology. SMIC continues to use chipmaking equipment from American vendors including Applied Materials Inc. even after it got blacklisted by the U.S. in 2020. If the company fails to comply with U.S. sanctions, it could face tightening of restrictions that may make it more difficult or impossible to secure licenses for repair parts and new equipment.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>China, though, may be tempted by the prospect of resource-rich Russia being dependent on Beijing for a functioning economy, as well as the longer-term project of building economic and technical systems that are independent of the West. That could entail pushing SMIC to send chips to Russia in defiance of Western sanctions, with the thought being that short-term pain is worth the long-term gain. The risks of this approach are huge though: even if SMIC can&#8217;t get EUV, it can still get pretty far with deep ultraviolet (DUV), but <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-bar-investment-in-chinese-ai-giant-considers-banning-key-exports-to-top-chip-maker-11639092799\">the Biden administration is already pushing</a> to cut China off from any more of those machines as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The chip maker, SMIC, a year ago had been added to the entity list, which restricts companies from exporting U.S.-origin technology without a license. That, however, has proven ineffective in keeping many manufacturing tools used to make semiconductors out of SMIC’s hands, the people familiar said. Under the current designation, SMIC is restricted from buying U.S. tools “uniquely required” to build chips with 10-nanometer circuits and smaller, which is close to the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing technology. Since many manufacturing tools can be used to produce chips at a variety of sizes, exporters took the view that they were still able to sell tools that could be adjusted to produce the smaller chips and the restriction “became effectively language that means nothing,” one of the people said…</p>\n<p>  The Defense Department, with the support of officials at the State and Energy Departments, as well as the National Security Council, wants to change the wording to restrict SMIC’s access to items “capable of” producing semiconductors with 14-nanometer circuits and smaller, the people familiar said, broadening the list of items SMIC won’t be able to get.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is context for what may be the single biggest strategic question confronting the Biden administration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The U.S. has already damaged Huawei and constrained SMIC&#8217;s long-term prospects on the cutting edge, and there is a credible threat that the U.S. could further damage SMIC&#8217;s current capabilities.</li>\n<li>The U.S. doesn&#8217;t simply want SMIC to not sell to Russia, it also wants broader support from China for sanctions against Russia, particularly since China almost certainly has more influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin than any other country.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strategic choice is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The U.S. could relax sanctions on SMIC and address China&#8217;s broader semiconductor needs in exchange for cooperation on Russia, at the medium-term risk of increasing China&#8217;s technological capability (albeit with the upside of helping U.S. firms that undergird much of the semiconductor industry).</li>\n<li>Alternatively, the U.S. could simply pressure China to not sell to Russia, or even ratchet up pressure on SMIC, at the short-term risk of China taking a hit to its technological industry in exchange for supporting Russia and building an alternative to the U.S.-dominated world order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not an easy question, particularly in the heat of the current moment. China, not Russia, is the U.S.&#8217;s long-term strategic rival; more than that, though, is another long-term issue that very much has a semiconductor component: Taiwan.</p>\n<h4>Taiwan and Deterrence</h4>\n<p>While China has framed its refusal to condemn Russia mostly in terms of NATO expansion, it&#8217;s not hard to draw the obvious parallel to Taiwan: given that Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China that it has the right to take back, by military means if necessary, it&#8217;s understandable why China might view Russian rhetoric about Ukraine&#8217;s historical ties to Russia with sympathy; given this, it&#8217;s possible that China is going to support Russia no matter what. Moreover, this also raises questions about the wisdom of enhancing China&#8217;s technological capabilities with American-derived technology, given the high likelihood that said enhancement will go towards increased military capabilities.</p>\n<p>At the same time, cutting China off from TSMC has brought its own risks; I wrote in the context of Huawei <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/taiwan-and-techs-geopolitical-realities-arm-on-mac-tsmcs-choice/\">in 2020</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Should the United States and China ever actually go to war, it would likely be because of Taiwan. In this TSMC specifically, and the Taiwan manufacturing base generally, are a significant deterrent: both China and the U.S. need access to the best chip maker in the world, along with a host of other high-precision pieces of the global electronics supply chain. That means that a hot war, which would almost certainly result in some amount of destruction to these capabilities, would, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-chip-makers-including-intel-seek-semiconductor-self-sufficiency-11589103002\">as the Wall Street Journal notes</a>, be devastating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    Taiwan, China and South Korea “represent a triad of dependency for the entire U.S. digital economy,” said an influential 2019 Pentagon report on national-security considerations regarding the supply chain for microelectronics. “Taiwan, in particular, represents a single point-of-failure for most of the United States’ largest, most important technology companies,” said the report, written by Rick Switzer, who served as a senior foreign-policy adviser to an Air Force unit. He concluded that the U.S. needs to strengthen its industrial policies to address the situation.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  It’s the same for China, as I noted in that Daily Update about Huawei; one of the risks of cutting China off from TSMC is that the deterrent value of TSMC’s operations is diminished. At the same time, though, Taiwan — and South Korea, for that matter, where Samsung’s most advanced fabs are located — are a whole lot closer to China than they are to the U.S., and the location of land masses is not changing, at least on a time scale that is significant to this discussion!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This point applies to semiconductors broadly: as long as China needs U.S. technology or TSMC manufacturing, it is heavily incentivized to not take action against Taiwan; when and if China develops its own technology, whether now or many years from now, that deterrence is no longer a factor. In other words, the short-term and longer-term are in opposition to the medium-term:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The short-term upside of relaxing sanctions against China in semiconductors in exchange for supporting sanctions against Russia is a potentially earlier end to the conflict in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>The medium-term risk of giving China access to Western technology is that China develops more advanced products that could be used by its military.</li>\n<li>The long-term risk of cutting China off is the development of an alternative to the West that is completely unconstrained by sanctions, public or private.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no obvious answer, and it&#8217;s worth noting that the historical pattern — i.e. the Cold War — is a complete separation of trade and technology. That is one possible path, that we may fall into by default. It&#8217;s worth remembering, though, that dividers in the street are no way to live, and while most U.S. tech companies have flexed their capabilities, the most impressive tech of all is attractive enough and irreplaceable enough that it could still create dependencies that lead to squabbles but not another war.</p>\n<h4>Tech Power</h4>\n<p>The most powerful takeaway from the past ten days, though, at least from a tech perspective, is related to the nuclear question. To return to India, from the <a href=\"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaMomentum.html\">Nuclear Weapons Archive</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A most telling (and often quoted) exchange between [India Prime Minister Inder Kumar] Gujral and Pres. Clinton occurred on 22 September 1997 at the occasion of the U.N. General Assembly session in New York. Gujral later recounted telling Clinton that an old Indian saying holds that Indians have a third eye. &#8220;I told President Clinton that when my third eye looks at the door of the Security Council chamber it sees a little sign that says &#8216;only those with economic power or nuclear weapons allowed.&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;it is very difficult to achieve economic wealth&#8217;.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The implication is that nuclear capability was a more attainable route to great nation status than was economic dominance; what, then, to make of an industry that can, via private sanction, destroy economic wealth above and beyond government action? The capability wielded by the tech industry is incredible; it is easy to cheer when it is being used in the service of intentions that are so clearly good. It&#8217;s equally easy to understand how much fear that capability may generate in the long run.</p>",
      "content_text": "While it has been only 11 days since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is already clear that the long-term impact on the tech industry is going to be substantial. The goal of this Article is to explore what those implications might be.\nLet me start with some caveats:\n\nFirst, while I presume it goes without saying, I condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.\nSecond, the situation is obviously extremely fluid. My goal is to write about impacts that seem likely to endure, but some issues, particularly those involving China, could shift considerably.\nThird, the long-term is inherently difficult to predict. Nearly every major event that has has happened over the last several years, from Donald Trump’s election, to COVID, to this invasion, was not only not anticipated by most people, but was in fact dismissed even after there were signs in place that they might occur. So take all of this with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nThe most important thing to make clear about this Article, though, is that much of it is focused on capabilities, not intentions. In much of our daily life we rely on the good intentions of others, even if they have dangerous capabilities. One mundane example is traffic on a two-way street: oncoming cars have the capability of swerving into my lane and hitting me head-on; I trust that they do not intend to do so. There are a whole host of similar examples, for good reason: societies that trust each other’s intentions function much more smoothly and efficiently; no one wants every single street to be built with concrete dividers between traffic.\nIn an ideal world international relations would work the same way, and there is an argument that much of the prosperity of the last few decades has been driven by the sort of increased trust and interconnectedness that comes from assuming the good intentions of other countries — or at a minimum enlightened self-interest — leading to increased economic efficiency for everyone engaged in global trade. In this arena, though, the question of capabilities is never far from the surface: what can one country do to another, should the intentions of the first country change, and what must the second country do to ameliorate that risk? And here there is very much a tech angle.\nPublic Versus Private Sanctions\nIn response to the invasion Western governments unleashed an unprecedented set of sanctions on Russia; these sanctions were primarily financial in nature, and included:\n\nDisconnecting sanctioned Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system\nCutting off the Russian Central Bank from foreign currency reserves held in the West\nIdentifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned Russian individuals\n\nThe sanctions, which were announced last weekend, led to the crashing of the ruble and the ongoing closure of the Russian stock market, and are expected to wreak havoc on the Russian economy; now the U.S. and E.U. are discussing banning imports of Russian oil.\nThis Article is not about those public sanctions, by which I mean sanctions coming from governments (Noah Smith has a useful overview of their impact here); what is interesting to me is the extent to which these public sanctions have been accompanied by private sanctions by companies, including:\n\nApple has stopped selling its products in Russia (although still operates the App Store).\nMicrosoft has suspended all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia, and SAP and Oracle have suspended operations.\nGoogle and Facebook suspended all advertising in Russia.\nActivision Blizzard, Epic Games, EA, and CD Projekt suspended game sales in Russia.\nDisney, Sony, and Warner Bros. paused film releases in Russia, and Netflix suspended its service.\nVisa and Mastercard cut off Russia from their respective international payment networks, and PayPal suspended service.\nSamsung stopped selling phones and chips, and Nvidia, Intel, and AMD also stopped selling chips to Russia.\n\nThis is an incomplete list! The key thing to note, though, is few if any of these actions were required by law; they were decisions made by individual companies.\nThis, though, is where the intentions versus capabilities distinction arises, in two different respects:\n\nFirst, the public/private distinction that I just noted may not be so apparent to people outside of the U.S. or the West generally; one could certainly understand how other countries might interpret this collection of public and private sanctions as being different parts of a single whole. To that end, this collection of actions demonstrates the capability of effectively wiping an economy off of the map.\nSecond, to the extent that the public/private distinction is understood, it highlights the capability of private companies to impose sanctions, and their willingness to do so in pursuit of political goals — even if those political goals are to stop an unjust invasion and save lives.\n\nI suspect that both of these interpretations matter and will have long-reaching effects, in part because they are not a new trend, but a continuation of an ongoing one.\nInternet 3.0 and the Rise of Politics\nLast January I wrote an article entitled Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History that argued that technology broadly has passed through two eras: 1.0 was the technological era, and 2.0 was the economic era.\nThe technological era was defined by the creation of the technical building blocks and protocols that undergird the Internet; there were few economic incentives beyond building products that people might want to buy, in part because few thought there was any money to be made on the Internet. That changed during the 2000s, as it became increasingly clear that the Internet provided massive returns to scale in a way that benefited both Aggregators and their customers. I wrote:\n\n  Google was founded in 1998, in the middle of the dot-com bubble, but it was the company’s IPO in 2004 that, to my mind, marked the beginning of Internet 2.0. This period of the Internet was about the economics of zero friction; specifically, unlike the assumptions that undergird Internet 1.0, it turned out that the Internet does not disperse economic power but in fact centralizes it. This is what undergirds Aggregation Theory: when services compete without the constraints of geography or marginal costs, dominance is achieved by controlling demand, not supply, and winners take most.\n  Aggregators like Google and Facebook weren’t the only winners though; the smartphone market was so large that it could sustain a duopoly of two platforms with multi-sided networks of developers, users, and OEMs (in the case of Android; Apple was both OEM and platform provider for iOS). Meanwhile, public cloud providers could provide back-end servers for companies of all types, with scale economics that not only lowered costs and increased flexibility, but which also justified far more investments in R&D that were immediately deployable by said companies.\n\nThere is no economic reason to ever leave this era, which leads many to assume we never will; services that are centralized work better for more people more cheaply, leaving no obvious product vector on which non-centralized alternatives are better. The exception is politics, and the point of that Article was to argue that we were entering a new era: the political era.\nGo back to the two points I raised above:\n\nIf a country, corporation, or individual assumes that the tech platforms of another country are acting in concert with their enemy, they are highly motivated to pursue alternatives to those tech platforms even if those platforms work better, are more popular, are cheaper, etc.\nIf a country, corporation, or individual assumes that tech platforms are themselves engaged in political action, they are highly motivated to pursue alternatives to those tech platforms even if those platforms work better, are more popular, are cheaper, etc.\n\nAgain, just to be crystal clear, these takeaways are true even if the intentions are pure, and the actions are just, because the question at hand is not about intentions but about capabilities. And while I get it can be hard to appreciate that distinction in the case of a situation like Ukraine, it’s worth noting that similar takeaways could be drawn from de-platforming controversies after January 6 and the attempts to control misinformation during COVID; if anything the fact that there are multiple object lessons in recent history of the willingness of platforms to both act in concert with governments and also of their own volition emphasizes the fact that from a realist perspective capabilities matter more than intentions, because the willingness to exercise those capabilities (to a widely varying degree, to be sure) has not been constrained to a single case.\nIndia and Sanctions\nThe two countries where these questions are likely to loom largest are China and India.\nStart with the latter: India is widely considered the most important long-term growth market for a whole host of tech companies, thanks to its massive population that is only just now coming online, combined with a growing economy that, to the extent it can follow a similar path to China, promises more opportunity than anywhere else in the world. In the economic era it has made perfect sense for India to be a core market for Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.\nIt was India, though, that raised some of the most strident objections to Twitter and Facebook’s decision to take down President Trump’s accounts after January 6, with several politicians pointing out that tech executives in San Francisco could do the same to them; in the case of the Ukraine invasion India is staying neutral, thanks in part to its significantly longer-term relationship with Russia, particularly from a military perspective. That makes it all-the-more likely that the aforementioned private sanctions are being interpreted in terms of capabilities, not intentions, clouding the long-term prospects of those tech companies counting on India for growth.\nIt’s important to note that this isn’t an abstract idea for India: the country’s nuclear program was started in response to India’s defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War, but the country’s first nuclear test in 1974 led to sanctions from the United States, as did far more extensive tests in 1998. The United States also sailed a fleet into the Bay of Bengal during a conflict with Pakistan in 1971, shortly after India signed a treaty with the USSR, and the fleet was there to oppose India, not to support it. This matters not because it excuses India’s neutrality in the current conflict, but to explain why these private sanctions from U.S. tech companies may have different interpretations and unintended consequences in a market they were counting on.\nChina is in a very different position, thanks to the long-run effects of the Great Firewall: U.S. consumer services companies obviously can’t sanction China, because China has already blocked them and built its own alternatives (one does wonder to what extent Moscow and perhaps even New Delhi look at the Great Firewall with jealousy). China’s problem — and potentially the West’s opportunity — lies with a far more fundamental piece of technology: semiconductors.\nSemiconductors and China\nChina’s leading semiconductor foundry is the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — SMIC for short. While the majority of SMIC’s volume is on older 55nm and 65nm process nodes, the company has a sizable and growing business at the extremely popular 28nm node. The company has also recently started mass production of 14nm and has demonstrated the ability to build 7nm chips. Even so, the most cutting edge companies in China have long been used to buying their chips abroad, whether that be Intel chips for servers or contracting with TSMC for everything else.\nThe Trump administration took square aim at both vectors: in the case of the latter all American chip companies and companies that relied on American technology — which is to say, all of them, including TSMC — were barred from selling to Huawei, effectively killing the company’s smartphone business and severely damaging its telecom business. SMIC, meanwhile, has been barred from acquiring ASML’s cutting-edge extreme ultroviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are essential for building 7nm and below chips cost-effectively.\nWhat is notable in terms of this conflict is that China has given every appearance of supporting Russia (although the country, like India, abstained from the United Nations motion to condemn Russia’s invasion). The big question in terms of Russian sanctions is just how far this support will go: on the one hand, working with Russia risks sanctions in the West, which is a much larger market for China; this is a big deterrent for SMIC, which has a big opportunity to undercut TSMC in price on trailing edge nodes. Seizing that opportunity means sanctioning Russia; from Bloomberg:\n\n  Washington is expected to lean on major Chinese companies from Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to Lenovo Group Ltd. to join U.S.-led sanctions against Russia, aiming to cripple the country’s ability to buy key technologies and components. China is Russia’s biggest supplier of electronics, accounting for a third of its semiconductor imports and more than half of its computers and smartphones. Beijing has opposed the increasingly severe measures that the U.S. has taken to restrict Russia’s trade and economy in response to its invasion of Ukraine, however U.S. officials expect tech suppliers such as SMIC to uphold the new rules and curtail trade of sensitive technology with American origin, especially as it relates to Russia’s defense sector.\n  Any items produced with certain U.S. inputs, including American software and designs, are subject to the ban, even if they are made overseas, a U.S. official told Bloomberg News on Monday.

If the company fails to comply with U.S. sanctions, it could face tightening of restrictions that may make it more difficult or impossible to secure licenses for repair parts and new equipment.\n\nChina, though, may be tempted by the prospect of resource-rich Russia being dependent on Beijing for a functioning economy, as well as the longer-term project of building economic and technical systems that are independent of the West. That could entail pushing SMIC to send chips to Russia in defiance of Western sanctions, with the thought being that short-term pain is worth the long-term gain.

China, not Russia, is the U.S.’s long-term strategic rival; more than that, though, is another long-term issue that very much has a semiconductor component: Taiwan.\nTaiwan and Deterrence\nWhile China has framed its refusal to condemn Russia mostly in terms of NATO expansion, it’s not hard to draw the obvious parallel to Taiwan: given that Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China that it has the right to take back, by military means if necessary, it’s understandable why China might view Russian rhetoric about Ukraine’s historical ties to Russia with sympathy; given this, it’s possible that China is going to support Russia no matter what. Moreover, this also raises questions about the wisdom of enhancing China’s technological capabilities with American-derived technology, given the high likelihood that said enhancement will go towards increased military capabilities.\nAt the same time, cutting China off from TSMC has brought its own risks; I wrote in the context of Huawei in 2020:\n\n  Should the United States and China ever actually go to war, it would likely be because of Taiwan. In this TSMC specifically, and the Taiwan manufacturing base generally, are a significant deterrent: both China and the U.S. need access to the best chip maker in the world, along with a host of other high-precision pieces of the global electronics supply chain. That means that a hot war, which would almost certainly result in some amount of destruction to these capabilities, would, as the Wall Street Journal notes, be devastating:\n\n    Taiwan, China and South Korea “represent a triad of dependency for the entire U.S. digital economy,” said an influential 2019 Pentagon report on national-security considerations regarding the supply chain for microelectronics. “Taiwan, in particular, represents a single point-of-failure for most of the United States’ largest, most important technology companies,” said the report, written by Rick Switzer, who served as a senior foreign-policy adviser to an Air Force unit. He concluded that the U.S. needs to strengthen its industrial policies to address the situation.\n  \n  It’s the same for China, as I noted in that Daily Update about Huawei; one of the risks of cutting China off from TSMC is that the deterrent value of TSMC’s operations is diminished. At the same time, though, Taiwan — and South Korea, for that matter, where Samsung’s most advanced fabs are located — are a whole lot closer to China than they are to the U.S., and the location of land masses is not changing, at least on a time scale that is significant to this discussion!\n\nThis point applies to semiconductors broadly: as long as China needs U.S. technology or TSMC manufacturing, it is heavily incentivized to not take action against Taiwan; when and if China develops its own technology, whether now or many years from now, that deterrence is no longer a factor.

That is one possible path, that we may fall into by default. It’s worth remembering, though, that dividers in the street are no way to live, and while most U.S. tech companies have flexed their capabilities, the most impressive tech of all is attractive enough and irreplaceable enough that it could still create dependencies that lead to squabbles but not another war.\nTech Power\nThe most powerful takeaway from the past ten days, though, at least from a tech perspective, is related to the nuclear question. To return to India, from the Nuclear Weapons Archive:\n\n  A most telling (and often quoted) exchange between [India Prime Minister Inder Kumar] Gujral and Pres. Clinton occurred on 22 September 1997 at the occasion of the U.N. General Assembly session in New York. Gujral later recounted telling Clinton that an old Indian saying holds that Indians have a third eye. “I told President Clinton that when my third eye looks at the door of the Security Council chamber it sees a little sign that says ‘only those with economic power or nuclear weapons allowed.’ I said to him, ‘it is very difficult to achieve economic wealth’.”\n\nThe implication is that nuclear capability was a more attainable route to great nation status than was economic dominance; what, then, to make of an industry that can, via private sanction, destroy economic wealth above and beyond government action? The capability wielded by the tech industry is incredible; it is easy to cheer when it is being used in the service of intentions that are so clearly good. It’s equally easy to understand how much fear that capability may generate in the long run.",

One could, with a bit of trouble, open a merchant account and accept credit cards; 3PL warehouses could hold inventory; UPS and Fedex could deliver your goods. And, of course, you could run really cheap ads on Google. What was missing was software to tie all of those pieces together, which is exactly what Lütke built for Snowdevil, his snowboard shop, and in 2006 opened up to other merchants; the software&#8217;s name was called Shopify:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=640%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify started as the center of multiple third party services\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8547\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=1024%2C610&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=1058%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1058w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This idea of Shopify as the hub for an e-commerce shop is one that has persisted to this day, but over the ensuing years Shopify has added on platform components as well; a platform looks like this (from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\">The Bill Gates Line</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=640%2C345&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of Platform Businesses Attract Customers by Third Parties\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3468\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=1168%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1168w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first platform was the Shopify App Store, launched in 2009, where developers could access the Shopify API and create new plugins to deliver specific functionality that merchants might need. For example, if you want to offer a product on a subscription basis you might install <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments\">Recharge Subscriptions</a>; if you want help managing your shipments you might install <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/shipstation\">ShipStation</a>. Shopify itself delivers additional functionality through the Shopify App Store, like its <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/facebook\">Facebook Channel</a> plugin, which lets you easily sync your products to Facebook to easily manage your advertising.</p>\n<p>A year later Shopify launched the Shopify Theme Store, where merchants could buy a professional theme to make their site their own; now the hub looked like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=640%2C341&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify added two platforms for apps and themes\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8546\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=1024%2C545&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=768%2C409&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=1184%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1184w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>At the same time Shopify also vertically integrated to incorporate features it once left to partners; the most important of these integrations was Shopify Payments, which launched in 2013 and was rebranded as Shop Pay in 2020. Yes, you could still use a clunky merchant account, but it was far easier to simply use the built-in Shop Pay functionality. Shop Pay was also critical in that it was the first part of the Shopify stack to build a consumer brand: users presented with a myriad of payment options know that if they click the purple Shop Pay button all of their payment and delivery information will be pre-populated, making it possible to buy with just one additional tap.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=640%2C336&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify integrated into payments with Shop Pay\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8548\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=768%2C404&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=1198%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1198w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Even with this toehold in the consumer space, though, Shopify has remained a company that is focused first-and-foremost on its merchants and <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/about\">its mission</a> to &#8220;help people achieve independence by making it easier to start, run, and grow a business.&#8221; That independence doesn&#8217;t just mean one-person entrepreneurs either: good-size brands like Gymshark, Rebecca Minkoff, KKW Beauty, Kylie Cosmetics, and FIGS leverage Shopify to build brands that are independent of Amazon in particular.</p>\n<h4>Apple and Facebook</h4>\n<p>In 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/\">Apple and Facebook</a> I explained the symbiotic relationship between the two companies when it came to the App Store:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Facebook’s early stumbles on mobile are well-documented: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130414025919/http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/11/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-home.pr.fortune/\">the company bet on web-based apps</a> that just didn’t work very well; the company completely rewrote its iOS app even as it was going public, which meant it had a stagnating app at the exact time mobile was exploding, threatening the desktop advertising product and platform that were the basis of the company’s S-1.</p>\n<p>  The re-write turned out to be not just a company-saving move — the native mobile app had the exact same user-facing features as the web-centric one, with the rather important detail that it actually worked — but in fact an industry-transformational one: one of the first new products enabled by the company’s new app were app install ads. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/facebook-mobile-app-install-ads/\">From TechCrunch in 2012</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    Facebook is making a big bet on the app economy, and wants to be the top source of discovery outside of the app stores. The mobile app install ads let developers buy tiles that promote their apps in the Facebook mobile news feed. When tapped, these instantly open the Apple App Store or Google Play market where users can download apps.</p>\n<p>    The ads are working already. One client TinyCo saw a 50% higher click through rate and higher conversion rates compared to other install channels. Facebook’s ads also brought in more engaged users. Ads tech startup Nanigans clients attained 8-10X more reach than traditional mobile ad buys when it purchased Facebook mobile app install ads. AdParlor racked up a consistent 1-2% click through rate.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  Facebook’s App Install product quickly became the most important channel for acquiring users, particularly for games that monetized with Apple’s in-app purchase API: the combination of Facebook data with developer’s sophisticated understanding of expected value per app install led to an explosion in App Store revenue. \n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth underlining this point: the App Store would not be nearly the juggernaut it is today, nor would Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Services Narrative&#8221; be so compelling, were it not for the work that Facebook put in to build out the best customer acquisition engine in the industry (much to the company&#8217;s financial benefit, to be clear); Apple and Facebook&#8217;s relationship looked like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=640%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Apple and Facebook&#039;s symbiotic relationship\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8550\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=1024%2C605&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=1067%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1067w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Facebook was by far the best and most efficient way to acquire new users, while Apple was able to sit back and harvest 30% of the revenue earned from those new users. Yes, some number of users came in via the App Store, but the primary discovery mechanism in the App Store is search, which relies on a user knowing what they want; Facebook showed users apps they never knew existed.</p>\n<h4>Facebook and Shopify</h4>\n<p>Facebook plays a similar role for e-commerce, particularly the independent sellers that exist on Shopify:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=640%2C345&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify&#039;s dependence on Facebook\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8545\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=1169%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1169w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>What makes Facebook&#8217;s approach so effective is that its advertising is a platform in its own right. Just as every app on a smartphone or every piece of software on a PC shares the same resources and API, every advertiser on Facebook, from app maker to e-commerce seller and everyone in-between, uses the same set of APIs that Facebook provides. What makes this so effective, though, is that the  shared resources are not computing power but data, especially conversion data; I explained how this worked in 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/privacy-labels-and-lookalike-audiences/\">Privacy Labels and Lookalike Audiences</a>, but briefly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook shows a user an ad, and records the unique identifier provided by their phone (IDFA, Identifier for Advertisers, on iOS; GAID, Google Advertising Identifer, on Android).</li>\n<li>A user downloads an app, or makes an e-commerce purchase; Facebook&#8217;s SDK, which is embedded in the app or e-commerce site, again records the IDFA or notes the referral code that led the user to the site, and charges the advertiser for a successful conversion.</li>\n<li>The details around this conversion, whether it be which creative was used in the ad, what was purchased, how much was spent, etc., is added to the profile of the user who saw the ad.</li>\n<li>Advertisers take out new ads on Facebook asking the company to find users who are similar to users who have purchased from them before (Facebook knows this from past purchases seen by its SDK, or because an advertiser uploads a list of past customers).</li>\n<li>Facebook repeats this process, further refining its understanding of customers, apps, and e-commerce offerings in the process, including the esoteric ways (only discoverable by machine learnings) in which they relate to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The critical thing to understand about this process is that no one app or e-commerce seller stands alone; everyone has collectively deputized Facebook to hold all of the pertinent user data and to figure out how all of the pieces fit together in a way that lets each individual app maker or e-commerce retailer acquire new customers for a price less than what that customer is worth to them in lifetime value.</p>\n<p>This, by extension, means that Shopify doesn&#8217;t stand alone either: the company is even more dependent on Facebook to drive e-commerce than Apple ever was to drive app installs.<sup id=\"rf1-8541\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#fn1-8541\" title=\"While you can make purchases from brands in the Shop Pay app, it&#8217;s an insignificant channel that isn&#8217;t at all comparable to Apple&#8217;s own direct route to customers via the App Store.\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not a surprise that Facebook&#8217;s recent plunge in value was preceded (and then followed) by Shopify&#8217;s own:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=640%2C310&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify and Facebook&#039;s faltering stocks\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8544\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=1200%2C581&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Part of Shopify&#8217;s decline is likely related to the fact that it is another pandemic stock: the sort of growth the company saw while customers were stuck at home with nothing to do other than shop online couldn&#8217;t go on forever. Moreover, the company announced big increases in spending (more on this in a moment). However, the major headwind the company shares with Facebook is Apple.</p>\n<h4>ATT&#8217;s Impact</h4>\n<p>I have been writing regularly about Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) initiative since it was announced two years ago, so I won&#8217;t belabor the point; the key thing to understand is that ATT broke the Facebook advertising collective. On the app install side this was done by technical means: Apple made the IDFA an opt-in behind a scary warning about tracking, which most users declined.</p>\n<p>The e-commerce side is more interesting: while Apple can&#8217;t technically limit what Facebook collects via its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel\">Pixel</a> on a retailer&#8217;s website, ATT bans said broad collection all the same. To that end Facebook <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/facebooks-ios-14-announcement-understanding-the-idfa-the-real-showdown/\">originally announced plans</a> to not show the ATT prompt and abandon the IDFA; a few months later <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-and-apple-continued-facebooks-ios-14-changes-georgia-and-tech/\">the company did an about-face</a> announcing that it would indeed show the ATT prompt, and also limit what it collected in its in-app browser via the Facebook Pixel.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear what happened to change Facebook&#8217;s mind; had they continued on their original path then their app advertising business would have suffered from a loss of data, but the e-commerce advertising would have been relatively unaffected (the loss of IDFA-related app install data would have decreased the amount of data available for that machine learning-driven targeting). What seems likely — and to be clear, this is pure speculation — is that Apple threatened to kick Facebook and its apps out of the App Store if it didn&#8217;t abide by ATT&#8217;s policies, even the parts that were technically unenforceable.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the net impact is that it was suddenly impossible for Facebook to tie together all of the various pieces of that virtuous cycle I described above deterministically. Ads were hard to tie to conversions, conversions were hard to tie to users, which meant that users and advertisers were hard to tie to each other, resulting in less relevant ads for the former that cost more money for the latter.<sup id=\"rf2-8541\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#fn2-8541\" title=\"Facebook&#8217;s advertising is sold on an auction basis, and advertisers often bid against desired outcomes, like conversions; the more difficult it is to target users the more users there are who need to be showed an ad, which increases demand for inventory, increasing prices.\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> The monetary impact is massive: Facebook forecast a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/metas-earnings-facebooks-three-challenges-financial-versus-existential-risks/\">$10 billion hit to 2022 revenue</a>, and as noted, its market value has been cut by a third.</p>\n<p>Note, however, that ATT didn&#8217;t hurt all advertisers: companies like Google and Amazon are doing great; I explained why in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/\">Digital Advertising in 2022</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Amazon’s advertising business has three big advantages relative to Facebook’s.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Search advertising is the best and most profitable form of advertising.</strong> This goes back to the point I made above: the more certain you are that you are showing advertising to a receptive customer, the more advertisers are willing to bid for that ad slot, and text in a search box will always be more accurate than the best targeting.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon faces no data restrictions.</strong> That noted, Amazon also has data on its users, and it is free to collect as much of it as it likes, and leverage it however it wishes when it comes to selling ads. This is because all of Amazon’s data collection, ad targeting, and conversion happen on the same platform — Amazon.com, or the Amazon app. ATT only restricts third party data sharing, which means it doesn’t affect Amazon at all.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon benefits from ATT spillover.</strong> That is not to say that ATT didn’t have an effect on Amazon: I noted above that Snap’s business did better than expected in part because its business wasn’t dominated by direct advertising to the extent that Facebook’s was, and that more advertising money flowed into other types of advertising. This almost certainly made a difference for Amazon as well: one of the most affected areas of Facebook advertising was e-commerce; if you are an e-commerce seller whose <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">Shopify store powered-by Facebook ads</a> was suddenly under-performing thanks to ATT, then the natural response is to shift products and advertising spend to Amazon.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>  All of these advantages will persist: search advertising will always be effective, and Amazon can always leverage data, and while some degree of ATT-related pullback was likely due to both uncertainty and the fact that Facebook hasn’t built back its advertising stack for a post-ATT world, the fact that said future stack will never be quite as good as the old one means that there is more e-commerce share to be grabbed than there might have been otherwise.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This last point is not set in stone: Shopify is already making major investments to compete with Amazon; it has the opportunity to do even more.</p>\n<h4>The Shopify Fulfillment Network</h4>\n<p>In 2019 I wrote about Shopify and its orthogonal competition with Amazon in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">Shopify and the Power of Platforms</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The difference is that Shopify is a platform: instead of interfacing with customers directly, 820,000 3rd-party merchants sit on top of Shopify and are responsible for acquiring all of those customers on their own.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=640%2C442&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The Shopify Platform\" width=\"640\" height=\"442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4281\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?w=990&amp;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C530&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=913%2C630&amp;ssl=1 913w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  […]</p>\n<p>  This is how Shopify can both in the long run be the biggest competitor to Amazon even as it is a company that Amazon can’t compete with: Amazon is pursuing customers and bringing suppliers and merchants onto its platform on its own terms; Shopify is giving merchants an opportunity to differentiate themselves while bearing no risk if they fail.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The context of that Article was Shopify&#8217;s announcement of yet another platform initiative: the Shopify Fulfillment Network.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  From the company’s <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/unite-2019#5\">blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    Customers want their online purchases fast, with free shipping. It’s now expected, thanks to the recent standard set by the largest companies in the world. Working with third-party logistics companies can be tedious. And finding a partner that won’t obscure your customer data or hide your brand with packaging is a challenge.</p>\n<p>    This is why we’re building Shopify Fulfillment Network—a geographically dispersed network of fulfillment centers with smart inventory-allocation technology. We use machine learning to predict the best places to store and ship your products, so they can get to your customers as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>    We’ve negotiated low rates with a growing network of warehouse and logistic providers, and then passed on those savings to you. We support multiple channels, custom packaging and branding, and returns and exchanges. And it’s all managed in Shopify.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  The first paragraph explains why the Shopify Fulfillment Network was a necessary step for Shopify: Amazon may commoditize suppliers, hiding their brand from website to box, but if its offering is truly superior, suppliers don’t have much choice. That was increasingly the case with regards to fulfillment, particularly for the small-scale sellers that are important to Shopify not necessarily for short-term revenue generation but for long-run upside. Amazon was simply easier for merchants and more reliable for customers.</p>\n<p>  Notice, though, that Shopify is not doing everything on their own: there is an entire world of third-party logistics companies (known as “3PLs”) that offer warehousing and shipping services. What Shopify is doing is what platforms do best: act as an interface between two modularized pieces of a value chain.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?resize=640%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of Shopify as an Interface\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4283\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?w=985&amp;ssl=1 985w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  On one side are all of Shopify’s hundreds of thousands of merchants: interfacing with all of them on an individual basis is not scalable for those 3PL companies; now, though, they only need to interface with Shopify. The same benefit applies in the opposite direction: merchants don’t have the means to negotiate with multiple 3PLs such that their inventory is optimally placed to offer fast and inexpensive delivery to customers; worse, the small-scale sellers I discussed above often can’t even get an audience with these logistics companies. Now, though, Shopify customers need only interface with Shopify.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the intervening three years, though, Shopify has moved away from this vision: Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) is not going to be a platform like the Shopify App Store but rather an integrated part of Shopify&#8217;s core offering like Shop Pay. President Harley Finkelstein explained on the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4487562-shopify-inc-shop-ceo-tobias-lutke-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript\">recent earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We are consolidating our network to larger facilities. We&#8217;ll operate more of them ourselves, and we&#8217;ll unify the warehouse management software that we&#8217;ve been building and testing over the past 18 months. We expect that these changes will enable us to deliver packages in 2 days or less to more than 90% of the U.S. population, while minimizing the inventory investment for SFN merchants. While Amy will go into more detail as to what our evolved vision looks like from a financial perspective, I can tell you, from a merchant&#8217;s perspective, Shopify Fulfillment can be life-changing for their businesses. We hear from merchants that fulfillment is only something you think about when it isn&#8217;t working well, and they are thrilled that they now never have to think about it. The stockouts and pre-orders that took the shine off strong demand for the new releases, largely became, I think, in the past, with Shopify Fulfillment. And just recently, I heard from a merchant who tells me that he sleeps even better because Shopify Fulfillment just works. Comments like these fuel our ambition, and we&#8217;ll continue to explore opportunities to give merchants more visibility and control over their most important assets.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Building and managing warehouses itself is a major commitment: Shopify is going to spend a billion dollars in capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024 building out the Shopify Fulfillment Network, and it seems safe to assume that that spending will only increase over time. I think, though, that this makes sense: Shopify learned from Shop Pay that it can decrease complexity for merchants and deliver a better experience for customers by doing essential functionality itself, and those same needs exist in logistics as well, particularly given Amazon&#8217;s massive investment in its own integrated operations.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, though, logistics isn&#8217;t the only advantage that Amazon has.</p>\n<h4>Shopify Advertising Services</h4>\n<p>Remember the fundamental challenge that ATT presents to Facebook: the company can no longer pool the conversion and targeting data of all of its advertisers such that the sum of effectiveness vastly exceeds what any one of those advertisers could accomplish on their own. The response of the gaming market has been <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/\">a wave of consolidation</a> to better pool and leverage data. Amazon, as noted, is well ahead of the curve here: because the company&#8217;s third-party merchant ecosystem lives within the Amazon.com website and app, Amazon has full knowledge of conversions and the ability to target consumers without any interference from Apple.</p>\n<p>Shopify is halfway there: a massive number of e-commerce retailers are on Shopify, but today Shopify mostly treats them all as individual entities, having left the pooling of data for advertising to Facebook. Now that Facebook is handicapped by Apple, Shopify should step up to provide substitute functionality and build its own advertising network.</p>\n<p>This advertising network, though, would look a bit different than what you might expect. First, Shopify doesn&#8217;t have any major customer-facing properties to display ads; it could potentially build some cross-shop advertising, but that doesn&#8217;t seem very ideal for either merchants or customers. The reality is that Shopify merchants still need to find customers on other sites like social networks; the challenge is doing so without knowing who is actually seeing the ads.</p>\n<p>Here Shopify&#8217;s ability to act on behalf of the entire Shopify network provides an opening: instead of being an advertising seller at scale, like Facebook, Shopify the company would become an advertising buyer at scale. Armed with its perfect knowledge of conversions it could run probabilistically-targeted campaigns that are much more precise than anyone else, using every possible parameter available to advertisers on Facebook or anywhere else, and over time build sophisticated cohorts that map to certain types of products and purchase patterns. No single Shopify merchant could do this on their own with a similar level of sophistication, which Facebook indirectly admitted on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4483754-meta-platforms-inc-s-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q4-2021-results-earning-call-transcript\">its recent earnings call</a>; COO Sheryl Sandberg said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  On measurement, there were 2 key areas within measurement, which were impacted as a result of Apple&#8217;s iOS changes. And I talked about this on the call last quarter as you referenced. The first is the underreporting gap. And what&#8217;s happening here is that advertisers worry they&#8217;re not getting the ROI they&#8217;re actually getting. On this part, we&#8217;ve made real progress on that underreporting gap since last quarter, and we believe we&#8217;ll continue to make more progress in the years ahead. I do want to caution that it&#8217;s easier to address this with large campaigns and harder with small campaigns, which means that part will take longer, and it also means that Apple&#8217;s changes continue to hurt small businesses more.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sandberg&#8217;s comment was primarily about the sheer amount of data produced by larger campaigns, but the same principle applies to the sheer number of campaigns as well: any one advertiser is, thanks to ATT, limited in the data points they can get from Facebook, making it more difficult to run multiple campaigns to better understand what works and what doesn&#8217;t. However, Shopify could in theory run campaigns for each of its individual merchants and collate the data on the back-end; this is the inverse of Amazon&#8217;s advantage of being one website, because in this case Shopify benefits from having a hand in such a huge number of them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I suspect the response of many close Shopify watchers is that such an initiative is not in the company&#8217;s DNA; that, though, is why the evolution of the Shopify Fulfillment Network is so notable: building and operating warehouses wasn&#8217;t really in the company&#8217;s DNA either, but it is the right thing to do if the company is going to continue to power <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">The Anti-Amazon Alliance</a>. The same principle applies to this theoretical ad network, particularly given that it is Amazon who is a big winner from Apple&#8217;s changes.</p>\n<p>What is interesting is that it appears that Shopify is already flirting with this idea:<sup id=\"rf3-8541\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#fn3-8541\" title=\"Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eric_seufert&quot;&gt;Eric Seufert&lt;/a&gt; for tipping me off to this.\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Last summer the company quietly introduced the concept of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dennishegstad/status/1406432771275472897\">Shopify Audiences</a> during an invite-only presentation; Tanay Jaipuria fleshed out the concept <a href=\"https://tanay.substack.com/p/shopify-audiences\">on Substack</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Shopify Audiences is a data exchange network, which uses aggregated conversion data (i.e., data around which people bought a merchant’s product) across all opted-in merchants on Shopify to generate a custom audience for a given merchant’s product. This audience is essentially a set of people Shopify believes are likely to be interested in your product given the data around all transactions that have taken place across all opted-in merchants on Shopify.</p>\n<p>  Merchants can then use these audiences when advertising on FB, Snap, Twitter, and other ad platforms1 either as custom audiences or lookalike audiences which should result in higher-performing ads and lower cost per conversion to acquire customers/sales.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a big step, and is very valuable for Facebook advertising in particular; however, it doesn&#8217;t address the Apple issue, because <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/apple-email-lists-cannot-be-used-for-ad-targeting/\">ATT bans custom and lookalike audiences from external data sources</a>. That means that Data Exchange can&#8217;t be used in any campaign targeting iOS users. That is why Shopify Audiences is only the first step: to make this work Shopify Audiences needs to become Shopify Advertising Services, where Shopify doesn&#8217;t just collect the targets but buys the ads to target them as well, in a way no one else in the world can.</p>\n<h4>The Conservation of Attractive Profits</h4>\n<p>Shopify Advertising Services, Shopify Fulfillment Network, and Shop Pay would, without question, result in a very different looking company than the one I sketched out at the beginning of this Article:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=640%2C366&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify with integrated payments, fulfillment, and advertising\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8549\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=1024%2C586&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=768%2C440&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=1100%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This sort of monolith, though, makes sense not only because of the specifics of what is happening in the market, but from a theoretical perspective as well. I wrote another article about Shopify a year ago called <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/market-making-on-the-internet/\">Market-Making on the Internet</a>, highlighting how major consumer-facing platforms were increasingly incorporating Shopify into their sites and apps:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What makes the Shopify platform so fascinating is that over time more and more of the e-commerce it enables happens somewhere other than a Shopify website. Shopify, for example, can <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/sell-on-amazon\">help you sell on Amazon</a>, and in what will be <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-earnings-atts-impact-covid-vr-ar-and-optionality/\">an increasingly important channel</a>, Facebook Shops. In the latter case Facebook and Shopify are partnering to create a fully-integrated market: Facebook’s userbase and advertising tools on one side, and Shopify’s e-commerce management and seller base on the other. The broader takeaway, though, is that Shopify’s real value proposition is working across markets, not creating an exclusive one.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s motivations are clear: conversions in Facebook Shops can be tracked in a way conversions on websites no longer can be, which will result in in more effective advertising; it is to Shopify&#8217;s credit that they are seen as such an important and credible partner that Facebook is going as far as <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/shop-pay-on-google-and-facebook-shopifys-evolution-the-e-commerce-shift/\">incorporating Shop Pay as well</a>. Even so, this is very much an example of Facebook integrating and Shopify, as it must, modularizing to accommodate them. That is a recipe for long run commoditization.</p>\n<p>That is why it is a good thing that Shopify is integrating elsewhere in its business: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/\">profits in a value chain follow integration</a>, and the more that Shopify is intertwined with the biggest players the more it needs to find other ways to differentiate. Shop Pay is already a massive win, and fulfillment has the chance to be another one; advertising shouldn&#8217;t be far behind.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution-follow-up-spotify-acquires-chartable-and-podsights/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-8541\"><p >While you can make purchases from brands in the Shop Pay app, it&#8217;s an insignificant channel that isn&#8217;t at all comparable to Apple&#8217;s own direct route to customers via the App Store.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#rf1-8541\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2-8541\"><p >Facebook&#8217;s advertising is sold on an auction basis, and advertisers often bid against desired outcomes, like conversions; the more difficult it is to target users the more users there are who need to be showed an ad, which increases demand for inventory, increasing prices.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#rf2-8541\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 2.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn3-8541\"><p >Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eric_seufert\">Eric Seufert</a> for tipping me off to this.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#rf3-8541\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 3.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "Tobi Lütke, who famously started Shopify when he realized that the software he built to run his snowboard shop was a much bigger opportunity than the shop itself, was reminiscing on Twitter about how cheap it used to be to run digital advertising:\n\n\nfun story: I had no one bidding against me on major ski resorts names with my snowboard ads in 2004. Turns out minimum bid for google ad is 0.20c. I bet if you would roll your face on a keyboard as keyword there would be 3 others bidding against you today.\n— tobi lutke (@tobi) February 17, 2022\n \nThis isn’t just a fun story: it’s a critical insight into the conditions that enabled Shopify to become the company that it is today; understanding how those conditions have changed give insight into what Shopify needs to become.\nShopify’s Evolution\nBack in 2004 a lot of the pieces that were necessary to run an e-commerce site existed, albeit in rudimentary and hard-to-use forms. One could, with a bit of trouble, open a merchant account and accept credit cards; 3PL warehouses could hold inventory; UPS and Fedex could deliver your goods. And, of course, you could run really cheap ads on Google. What was missing was software to tie all of those pieces together, which is exactly what Lütke built for Snowdevil, his snowboard shop, and in 2006 opened up to other merchants; the software’s name was called Shopify:\n\nThis idea of Shopify as the hub for an e-commerce shop is one that has persisted to this day, but over the ensuing years Shopify has added on platform components as well; a platform looks like this (from The Bill Gates Line):\n\n  \n\nThe first platform was the Shopify App Store, launched in 2009, where developers could access the Shopify API and create new plugins to deliver specific functionality that merchants might need. For example, if you want to offer a product on a subscription basis you might install Recharge Subscriptions; if you want help managing your shipments you might install ShipStation. Shopify itself delivers additional functionality through the Shopify App Store, like its Facebook Channel plugin, which lets you easily sync your products to Facebook to easily manage your advertising.\nA year later Shopify launched the Shopify Theme Store, where merchants could buy a professional theme to make their site their own; now the hub looked like this:\n\nAt the same time Shopify also vertically integrated to incorporate features it once left to partners; the most important of these integrations was Shopify Payments, which launched in 2013 and was rebranded as Shop Pay in 2020. Yes, you could still use a clunky merchant account, but it was far easier to simply use the built-in Shop Pay functionality. Shop Pay was also critical in that it was the first part of the Shopify stack to build a consumer brand: users presented with a myriad of payment options know that if they click the purple Shop Pay button all of their payment and delivery information will be pre-populated, making it possible to buy with just one additional tap.\n\nEven with this toehold in the consumer space, though, Shopify has remained a company that is focused first-and-foremost on its merchants and its mission to “help people achieve independence by making it easier to start, run, and grow a business.” That independence doesn’t just mean one-person entrepreneurs either: good-size brands like Gymshark, Rebecca Minkoff, KKW Beauty, Kylie Cosmetics, and FIGS leverage Shopify to build brands that are independent of Amazon in particular.\nApple and Facebook\nIn 2020’s Apple and Facebook I explained the symbiotic relationship between the two companies when it came to the App Store:\n\n  Facebook’s early stumbles on mobile are well-documented: the company bet on web-based apps that just didn’t work very well; the company completely rewrote its iOS app even as it was going public, which meant it had a stagnating app at the exact time mobile was exploding, threatening the desktop advertising product and platform that were the basis of the company’s S-1.\n  The re-write turned out to be not just a company-saving move — the native mobile app had the exact same user-facing features as the web-centric one, with the rather important detail that it actually worked — but in fact an industry-transformational one: one of the first new products enabled by the company’s new app were app install ads. From TechCrunch in 2012:\n\n    Facebook is making a big bet on the app economy, and wants to be the top source of discovery outside of the app stores. The mobile app install ads let developers buy tiles that promote their apps in the Facebook mobile news feed. When tapped, these instantly open the Apple App Store or Google Play market where users can download apps.\n    The ads are working already. One client TinyCo saw a 50% higher click through rate and higher conversion rates compared to other install channels. Facebook’s ads also brought in more engaged users. Ads tech startup Nanigans clients attained 8-10X more reach than traditional mobile ad buys when it purchased Facebook mobile app install ads. AdParlor racked up a consistent 1-2% click through rate.\n  \n  Facebook’s App Install product quickly became the most important channel for acquiring users, particularly for games that monetized with Apple’s in-app purchase API: the combination of Facebook data with developer’s sophisticated understanding of expected value per app install led to an explosion in App Store revenue. \n\nIt’s worth underlining this point: the App Store would not be nearly the juggernaut it is today, nor would Apple’s “Services Narrative” be so compelling, were it not for the work that Facebook put in to build out the best customer acquisition engine in the industry (much to the company’s financial benefit, to be clear); Apple and Facebook’s relationship looked like this:\n\nFacebook was by far the best and most efficient way to acquire new users, while Apple was able to sit back and harvest 30% of the revenue earned from those new users. Yes, some number of users came in via the App Store, but the primary discovery mechanism in the App Store is search, which relies on a user knowing what they want; Facebook showed users apps they never knew existed.\nFacebook and Shopify\nFacebook plays a similar role for e-commerce, particularly the independent sellers that exist on Shopify:\n\nWhat makes Facebook’s approach so effective is that its advertising is a platform in its own right. Just as every app on a smartphone or every piece of software on a PC shares the same resources and API, every advertiser on Facebook, from app maker to e-commerce seller and everyone in-between, uses the same set of APIs that Facebook provides. What makes this so effective, though, is that the  shared resources are not computing power but data, especially conversion data; I explained how this worked in 2020’s Privacy Labels and Lookalike Audiences, but briefly:\n\nFacebook shows a user an ad, and records the unique identifier provided by their phone (IDFA, Identifier for Advertisers, on iOS; GAID, Google Advertising Identifer, on Android).\nA user downloads an app, or makes an e-commerce purchase; Facebook’s SDK, which is embedded in the app or e-commerce site, again records the IDFA or notes the referral code that led the user to the site, and charges the advertiser for a successful conversion.\nThe details around this conversion, whether it be which creative was used in the ad, what was purchased, how much was spent, etc., is added to the profile of the user who saw the ad.\nAdvertisers take out new ads on Facebook asking the company to find users who are similar to users who have purchased from them before (Facebook knows this from past purchases seen by its SDK, or because an advertiser uploads a list of past customers).\nFacebook repeats this process, further refining its understanding of customers, apps, and e-commerce offerings in the process, including the esoteric ways (only discoverable by machine learnings) in which they relate to each other.\n\nThe critical thing to understand about this process is that no one app or e-commerce seller stands alone; everyone has collectively deputized Facebook to hold all of the pertinent user data and to figure out how all of the pieces fit together in a way that lets each individual app maker or e-commerce retailer acquire new customers for a price less than what that customer is worth to them in lifetime value.\nThis, by extension, means that Shopify doesn’t stand alone either: the company is even more dependent on Facebook to drive e-commerce than Apple ever was to drive app installs.1 That’s why it’s not a surprise that Facebook’s recent plunge in value was preceded (and then followed) by Shopify’s own:\n\nPart of Shopify’s decline is likely related to the fact that it is another pandemic stock: the sort of growth the company saw while customers were stuck at home with nothing to do other than shop online couldn’t go on forever. Moreover, the company announced big increases in spending (more on this in a moment). However, the major headwind the company shares with Facebook is Apple.\nATT’s Impact\nI have been writing regularly about Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) initiative since it was announced two years ago, so I won’t belabor the point; the key thing to understand is that ATT broke the Facebook advertising collective. On the app install side this was done by technical means: Apple made the IDFA an opt-in behind a scary warning about tracking, which most users declined.\nThe e-commerce side is more interesting: while Apple can’t technically limit what Facebook collects via its Pixel on a retailer’s website, ATT bans said broad collection all the same. To that end Facebook originally announced plans to not show the ATT prompt and abandon the IDFA; a few months later the company did an about-face announcing that it would indeed show the ATT prompt, and also limit what it collected in its in-app browser via the Facebook Pixel.\nIt’s unclear what happened to change Facebook’s mind; had they continued on their original path then their app advertising business would have suffered from a loss of data, but the e-commerce advertising would have been relatively unaffected (the loss of IDFA-related app install data would have decreased the amount of data available for that machine learning-driven targeting). What seems likely — and to be clear, this is pure speculation — is that Apple threatened to kick Facebook and its apps out of the App Store if it didn’t abide by ATT’s policies, even the parts that were technically unenforceable.\nRegardless, the net impact is that it was suddenly impossible for Facebook to tie together all of the various pieces of that virtuous cycle I described above deterministically. Ads were hard to tie to conversions, conversions were hard to tie to users, which meant that users and advertisers were hard to tie to each other, resulting in less relevant ads for the former that cost more money for the latter.2 The monetary impact is massive: Facebook forecast a $10 billion hit to 2022 revenue, and as noted, its market value has been cut by a third.\nNote, however, that ATT didn’t hurt all advertisers: companies like Google and Amazon are doing great; I explained why in Digital Advertising in 2022:\n\n  Amazon’s advertising business has three big advantages relative to Facebook’s.\n\nSearch advertising is the best and most profitable form of advertising. This goes back to the point I made above: the more certain you are that you are showing advertising to a receptive customer, the more advertisers are willing to bid for that ad slot, and text in a search box will always be more accurate than the best targeting.\nAmazon faces no data restrictions. That noted, Amazon also has data on its users, and it is free to collect as much of it as it likes, and leverage it however it wishes when it comes to selling ads. This is because all of Amazon’s data collection, ad targeting, and conversion happen on the same platform — Amazon.com, or the Amazon app. ATT only restricts third party data sharing, which means it doesn’t affect Amazon at all.\nAmazon benefits from ATT spillover. That is not to say that ATT didn’t have an effect on Amazon: I noted above that Snap’s business did better than expected in part because its business wasn’t dominated by direct advertising to the extent that Facebook’s was, and that more advertising money flowed into other types of advertising. This almost certainly made a difference for Amazon as well: one of the most affected areas of Facebook advertising was e-commerce; if you are an e-commerce seller whose Shopify store powered-by Facebook ads was suddenly under-performing thanks to ATT, then the natural response is to shift products and advertising spend to Amazon.\n\n  All of these advantages will persist: search advertising will always be effective, and Amazon can always leverage data, and while some degree of ATT-related pullback was likely due to both uncertainty and the fact that Facebook hasn’t built back its advertising stack for a post-ATT world, the fact that said future stack will never be quite as good as the old one means that there is more e-commerce share to be grabbed than there might have been otherwise.\n\nThis last point is not set in stone: Shopify is already making major investments to compete with Amazon; it has the opportunity to do even more.\nThe Shopify Fulfillment Network\nIn 2019 I wrote about Shopify and its orthogonal competition with Amazon in Shopify and the Power of Platforms:\n\n  The difference is that Shopify is a platform: instead of interfacing with customers directly, 820,000 3rd-party merchants sit on top of Shopify and are responsible for acquiring all of those customers on their own.\n  \n  […]\n  This is how Shopify can both in the long run be the biggest competitor to Amazon even as it is a company that Amazon can’t compete with: Amazon is pursuing customers and bringing suppliers and merchants onto its platform on its own terms; Shopify is giving merchants an opportunity to differentiate themselves while bearing no risk if they fail.\n\nThe context of that Article was Shopify’s announcement of yet another platform initiative: the Shopify Fulfillment Network.\n\n  From the company’s blog:\n\n    Customers want their online purchases fast, with free shipping. It’s now expected, thanks to the recent standard set by the largest companies in the world. Working with third-party logistics companies can be tedious. And finding a partner that won’t obscure your customer data or hide your brand with packaging is a challenge.\n    This is why we’re building Shopify Fulfillment Network—a geographically dispersed network of fulfillment centers with smart inventory-allocation technology. We use machine learning to predict the best places to store and ship your products, so they can get to your customers as fast as possible.\n    We’ve negotiated low rates with a growing network of warehouse and logistic providers, and then passed on those savings to you. We support multiple channels, custom packaging and branding, and returns and exchanges. And it’s all managed in Shopify.\n  \n  The first paragraph explains why the Shopify Fulfillment Network was a necessary step for Shopify: Amazon may commoditize suppliers, hiding their brand from website to box, but if its offering is truly superior, suppliers don’t have much choice. That was increasingly the case with regards to fulfillment, particularly for the small-scale sellers that are important to Shopify not necessarily for short-term revenue generation but for long-run upside. Amazon was simply easier for merchants and more reliable for customers.\n  Notice, though, that Shopify is not doing everything on their own: there is an entire world of third-party logistics companies (known as “3PLs”) that offer warehousing and shipping services. What Shopify is doing is what platforms do best: act as an interface between two modularized pieces of a value chain.\n  \n  On one side are all of Shopify’s hundreds of thousands of merchants: interfacing with all of them on an individual basis is not scalable for those 3PL companies; now, though, they only need to interface with Shopify. The same benefit applies in the opposite direction: merchants don’t have the means to negotiate with multiple 3PLs such that their inventory is optimally placed to offer fast and inexpensive delivery to customers; worse, the small-scale sellers I discussed above often can’t even get an audience with these logistics companies. Now, though, Shopify customers need only interface with Shopify.\n\nOver the intervening three years, though, Shopify has moved away from this vision: Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) is not going to be a platform like the Shopify App Store but rather an integrated part of Shopify’s core offering like Shop Pay. President Harley Finkelstein explained on the company’s recent earnings call:\n\n  We are consolidating our network to larger facilities. We’ll operate more of them ourselves, and we’ll unify the warehouse management software that we’ve been building and testing over the past 18 months. We expect that these changes will enable us to deliver packages in 2 days or less to more than 90% of the U.S. population, while minimizing the inventory investment for SFN merchants. While Amy will go into more detail as to what our evolved vision looks like from a financial perspective, I can tell you, from a merchant’s perspective, Shopify Fulfillment can be life-changing for their businesses. We hear from merchants that fulfillment is only something you think about when it isn’t working well, and they are thrilled that they now never have to think about it. The stockouts and pre-orders that took the shine off strong demand for the new releases, largely became, I think, in the past, with Shopify Fulfillment. And just recently, I heard from a merchant who tells me that he sleeps even better because Shopify Fulfillment just works. Comments like these fuel our ambition, and we’ll continue to explore opportunities to give merchants more visibility and control over their most important assets.\n\nBuilding and managing warehouses itself is a major commitment: Shopify is going to spend a billion dollars in capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024 building out the Shopify Fulfillment Network, and it seems safe to assume that that spending will only increase over time. I think, though, that this makes sense: Shopify learned from Shop Pay that it can decrease complexity for merchants and deliver a better experience for customers by doing essential functionality itself, and those same needs exist in logistics as well, particularly given Amazon’s massive investment in its own integrated operations.\nKeep in mind, though, logistics isn’t the only advantage that Amazon has.\nShopify Advertising Services\nRemember the fundamental challenge that ATT presents to Facebook: the company can no longer pool the conversion and targeting data of all of its advertisers such that the sum of effectiveness vastly exceeds what any one of those advertisers could accomplish on their own. The response of the gaming market has been a wave of consolidation to better pool and leverage data. Amazon, as noted, is well ahead of the curve here: because the company’s third-party merchant ecosystem lives within the Amazon.com website and app, Amazon has full knowledge of conversions and the ability to target consumers without any interference from Apple.\nShopify is halfway there: a massive number of e-commerce retailers are on Shopify, but today Shopify mostly treats them all as individual entities, having left the pooling of data for advertising to Facebook. Now that Facebook is handicapped by Apple, Shopify should step up to provide substitute functionality and build its own advertising network.\nThis advertising network, though, would look a bit different than what you might expect. First, Shopify doesn’t have any major customer-facing properties to display ads; it could potentially build some cross-shop advertising, but that doesn’t seem very ideal for either merchants or customers. The reality is that Shopify merchants still need to find customers on other sites like social networks; the challenge is doing so without knowing who is actually seeing the ads.\nHere Shopify’s ability to act on behalf of the entire Shopify network provides an opening: instead of being an advertising seller at scale, like Facebook, Shopify the company would become an advertising buyer at scale. Armed with its perfect knowledge of conversions it could run probabilistically-targeted campaigns that are much more precise than anyone else, using every possible parameter available to advertisers on Facebook or anywhere else, and over time build sophisticated cohorts that map to certain types of products and purchase patterns. No single Shopify merchant could do this on their own with a similar level of sophistication, which Facebook indirectly admitted on its recent earnings call; COO Sheryl Sandberg said:\n\n  On measurement, there were 2 key areas within measurement, which were impacted as a result of Apple’s iOS changes. And I talked about this on the call last quarter as you referenced. The first is the underreporting gap. And what’s happening here is that advertisers worry they’re not getting the ROI they’re actually getting. On this part, we’ve made real progress on that underreporting gap since last quarter, and we believe we’ll continue to make more progress in the years ahead. I do want to caution that it’s easier to address this with large campaigns and harder with small campaigns, which means that part will take longer, and it also means that Apple’s changes continue to hurt small businesses more.\n\nSandberg’s comment was primarily about the sheer amount of data produced by larger campaigns, but the same principle applies to the sheer number of campaigns as well: any one advertiser is, thanks to ATT, limited in the data points they can get from Facebook, making it more difficult to run multiple campaigns to better understand what works and what doesn’t. However, Shopify could in theory run campaigns for each of its individual merchants and collate the data on the back-end; this is the inverse of Amazon’s advantage of being one website, because in this case Shopify benefits from having a hand in such a huge number of them.\n\nI suspect the response of many close Shopify watchers is that such an initiative is not in the company’s DNA; that, though, is why the evolution of the Shopify Fulfillment Network is so notable: building and operating warehouses wasn’t really in the company’s DNA either, but it is the right thing to do if the company is going to continue to power The Anti-Amazon Alliance. The same principle applies to this theoretical ad network, particularly given that it is Amazon who is a big winner from Apple’s changes.\nWhat is interesting is that it appears that Shopify is already flirting with this idea:3 Last summer the company quietly introduced the concept of Shopify Audiences during an invite-only presentation; Tanay Jaipuria fleshed out the concept on Substack:\n\n  Shopify Audiences is a data exchange network, which uses aggregated conversion data (i.e., data around which people bought a merchant’s product) across all opted-in merchants on Shopify to generate a custom audience for a given merchant’s product. This audience is essentially a set of people Shopify believes are likely to be interested in your product given the data around all transactions that have taken place across all opted-in merchants on Shopify.\n  Merchants can then use these audiences when advertising on FB, Snap, Twitter, and other ad platforms1 either as custom audiences or lookalike audiences which should result in higher-performing ads and lower cost per conversion to acquire customers/sales.\n\nThis is a big step, and is very valuable for Facebook advertising in particular; however, it doesn’t address the Apple issue, because ATT bans custom and lookalike audiences from external data sources. That means that Data Exchange can’t be used in any campaign targeting iOS users. That is why Shopify Audiences is only the first step: to make this work Shopify Audiences needs to become Shopify Advertising Services, where Shopify doesn’t just collect the targets but buys the ads to target them as well, in a way no one else in the world can.\nThe Conservation of Attractive Profits\nShopify Advertising Services, Shopify Fulfillment Network, and Shop Pay would, without question, result in a very different looking company than the one I sketched out at the beginning of this Article:\n\nThis sort of monolith, though, makes sense not only because of the specifics of what is happening in the market, but from a theoretical perspective as well. I wrote another article about Shopify a year ago called Market-Making on the Internet, highlighting how major consumer-facing platforms were increasingly incorporating Shopify into their sites and apps:\n\n  What makes the Shopify platform so fascinating is that over time more and more of the e-commerce it enables happens somewhere other than a Shopify website. Shopify, for example, can help you sell on Amazon, and in what will be an increasingly important channel, Facebook Shops. In the latter case Facebook and Shopify are partnering to create a fully-integrated market: Facebook’s userbase and advertising tools on one side, and Shopify’s e-commerce management and seller base on the other. The broader takeaway, though, is that Shopify’s real value proposition is working across markets, not creating an exclusive one.\n\nFacebook’s motivations are clear: conversions in Facebook Shops can be tracked in a way conversions on websites no longer can be, which will result in in more effective advertising; it is to Shopify’s credit that they are seen as such an important and credible partner that Facebook is going as far as incorporating Shop Pay as well. Even so, this is very much an example of Facebook integrating and Shopify, as it must, modularizing to accommodate them. That is a recipe for long run commoditization.\nThat is why it is a good thing that Shopify is integrating elsewhere in its business: profits in a value chain follow integration, and the more that Shopify is intertwined with the biggest players the more it needs to find other ways to differentiate. Shop Pay is already a massive win, and fulfillment has the chance to be another one; advertising shouldn’t be far behind.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.\nWhile you can make purchases from brands in the Shop Pay app, it’s an insignificant channel that isn’t at all comparable to Apple’s own direct route to customers via the App Store. ↩Facebook’s advertising is sold on an auction basis, and advertisers often bid against desired outcomes, like conversions; the more difficult it is to target users the more users there are who need to be showed an ad, which increases demand for inventory, increasing prices. ↩Thanks to Eric Seufert for tipping me off to this. ↩",

Just as importantly, both companies are promising that leveraging their respective platforms will provide benefits on both sides of the ROI equation: the return will be better given the two companies&#8217; superior targeting capabilities and ability to measure conversion, and the investment will be smaller because you can manage your entire funnel from a single ad-buying interface.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Herein lies the first thing that I got wrong: the traditional marketing funnel made sense in a world where different parts of the customer journey happened in different places — literally. You might see an advertisement on TV, then a coupon in the newspaper, and finally the product on an end cap in a store. Every one of those exposures was a discrete advertising event that culminated in the customer picking up the product in question in putting it in their (literal) shopping cart.</p>\n<p>On the Internet, though, that journey is increasingly compressed into a single impression: you see an ad on Instagram, you click on it to find out more, you login with Shop Pay, and then you wonder what you were thinking when it shows up at your door a few days later. The loop for apps is even tighter: you see an ad, click an &#8216;Install&#8217; button, and are playing a level just seconds later. Sure, there are things like re-targeting or list building, but by-and-large Internet advertising, particularly when it comes to Facebook, is almost all direct response.</p>\n<p>This can make for an exceptionally resilient business model: because the return-on-investment (ROI) of direct response advertising is measurable to a fantastically greater degree than traditional advertising measurement, advertisers can spend right up to the level they place on a particular customer or transaction&#8217;s value; Facebook, of course, is willing to help them do that as easily as possible, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/\">squeezing out margin in the process</a>. Moreover, because these ads are sold at auction, the company is insulated from events like COVID or boycotts; I explained in 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/\">Apple and Facebook</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.</p>\n<p>  In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a part.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problem for Meta is in the title of that article: Apple. The latter&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) initiative severed the connection amongst e-commerce sellers, app developers, and Facebook by which Facebook achieved that ROI, and while the company is better positioned than anyone else to build a replacement, it is important to note that the impairment entailed in probabilistically measuring ad effectiveness instead of deterministically is a permanent one.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just a Facebook problem: Snap said on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4484260-snap-inc-snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript\">its earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Our advertising partners who prefer to leverage lower-funnel goals such as in-app purchases, have been most impacted by [ATT]. We are seeing these advertisers migrate to mid-funnel goals where they have greater visibility such as install or click. Advertisers who optimize via web-based goal-based bids or GBBs have been less impacted, given that many of them have adopted the Snap pixel.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Snap&#8217;s direct response business is not nearly as good as Facebook&#8217;s, and is a much smaller business both overall and in terms of the overall company&#8217;s revenue; that left <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1489415020094324739\">a lot more cushion to absorb ATT</a>, both because Snap&#8217;s performance had less to lose, and also because the company&#8217;s brand-business could help pick up the slack. This, paradoxically, led many investors to overfit Facebook&#8217;s disappointing forecast to Snap&#8217;s outlook; the reality is that advertising dollars will find a way to be spent, and the alternatives to direct response on Snap were more impactful to the bottom line than they are on Facebook, in part because the latter was so dominant in direct response until now.</p>\n<h4>The Amazon Advertising IPO</h4>\n<p>What made the Facebook model tick was the way in which the company could convert conversion tracking to targeting: because Facebook knew a lot about someone who saw an ad and then converted, they could easily find other people who were similar — <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/privacy-labels-and-lookalike-audiences/\">lookalike audiences</a> — and show them similar ads, continually optimizing their targeting and increasing their understanding along the way.</p>\n<p>Google Search, though, has a built-in advantage: Google doesn&#8217;t have to figure out what you are interested in because you do the company the favor of telling it by searching for it. The odds that you want a hotel in San Francisco are rather high if you search for &#8220;San Francisco hotels&#8221;; it&#8217;s the same thing with life insurance or car mechanics or e-commerce.</p>\n<p>Google is not the only search engine that monetizes e-commerce effectively. Back in 2015 I described the breakout of Amazon Web Services&#8217; financials as <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/the-aws-ipo/\">The AWS IPO</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This is why Amazon’s latest earnings were such a big deal: for the first time the company broke out AWS into its own line item, revealing not just its revenue (which could be teased out previously) but also its profitability. And, to many people’s surprise, and despite all the price cuts, AWS is very profitable: $265 million in profit on $1.57 billion in sales last quarter alone, for an impressive (for Amazon!) 17% net margin.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those numbers pale in comparison to what I guess we might call the Amazon Advertising IPO, given that the company broke out its advertising for the first time this quarter, revealing $9.7 billion in revenue, a 32% increase year-over-year (Amazon did not break out the unit&#8217;s profitability). While that is still a fraction of Google&#8217;s $61.2 billion last quarter, or Facebook&#8217;s $32.6 billion, it is a larger fraction than you might expect, and several multiples of Snap&#8217;s $1.3 billion in revenue. Indeed, given the fact that Amazon is closer in revenue to Facebook than Facebook is to Google it seems fair to characterize the advertising market as dominated not by a big two but a big three.</p>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s advertising business has three big advantages relative to Facebook&#8217;s.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Search advertising is the best and most profitable form of advertising.</strong> This goes back to the point I made above: the more certain you are that you are showing advertising to a receptive customer, the more advertisers are willing to bid for that ad slot, and text in a search box will always be more accurate than the best targeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Amazon faces no data restrictions.</strong> That noted, Amazon <em>also</em> has data on its users, and it is free to collect as much of it as it likes, and leverage it however it wishes when it comes to selling ads. This is because all of Amazon&#8217;s data collection, ad targeting, and conversion happen on the same platform — Amazon.com, or the Amazon app. ATT only restricts third party data sharing, which means it doesn&#8217;t affect Amazon at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Amazon benefits from ATT spillover.</strong> That is not to say that ATT didn&#8217;t have an effect on Amazon: I noted above that Snap&#8217;s business did better than expected in part because its business wasn&#8217;t dominated by direct advertising to the extent that Facebook&#8217;s was, and that more advertising money flowed into other types of advertising. This almost certainly made a difference for Amazon as well: one of the most affected areas of Facebook advertising was e-commerce; if you are an e-commerce seller whose <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">Shopify store powered-by Facebook ads</a> was suddenly under-performing thanks to ATT, then the natural response is to shift products and advertising spend to Amazon.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of these advantages will persist: search advertising will always be effective, and Amazon can always leverage data, and while some degree of ATT-related pullback was likely due to both uncertainty and the fact that Facebook hasn&#8217;t built back its advertising stack for a post-ATT world, the fact that said future stack will never be quite as good as the old one means that there is more e-commerce share to be grabbed than there might have been otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Google&#8217;s Dominance</h4>\n<p>Of course you could just as easily make an argument that when it comes to digital advertising there is Google and everyone else. Google clearly faces competition from Amazon for e-commerce search advertising — the European Commission&#8217;s Google Shopping case is only surpassed by the FTC&#8217;s Facebook lawsuit when it comes to overly narrow market definitions that ignore reality — but is dominant in terms of nearly every other vertical. Moreover, that dominance is shored up by the same factors favoring Amazon, at least in part.</p>\n<p>The first one is obvious: search advertising works great, and Google is the best at it.</p>\n<p>The second one, about data collection, is more interesting, particularly in the context of ATT. Facebook CFO Dave Wehner groused on <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Meta-Q4-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\">the company&#8217;s recent earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We believe the impact of iOS overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of $10 billion, so it&#8217;s a pretty significant headwind for our business. And we&#8217;re seeing that impact in a number of verticals. E-commerce was an area where we saw a meaningful slowdown in growth in Q4. And similarly, we&#8217;ve seen other areas like gaming be challenged. But on e-commerce, it&#8217;s quite notable that Google called out, seeing strength in that very same vertical. And so given that we know that e-commerce is one of the most impacted verticals from iOS restrictions, it makes sense that those restrictions are probably part of the explanation for the difference between what they were seeing and what we were seeing.</p>\n<p>  And if you look at it, we believe those restrictions from Apple are designed in a way that carves out browsers from the tracking prompts Apple requires for apps. And so what that means is that search ads could have access to far more third-party data for measurement and optimization purposes than app-based ad platforms like ours. So when it comes to using data, that it&#8217;s not really apples-to-apples for us. And as a result, we believe Google’s search ads business could have benefited relative to services like ours that face a different set of restrictions from Apple. And given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search ads, the incentive clearly exists for this policy discrepancy to continue.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Apple, it should be noted, has always treated the browser as a carve-out from its App Store restrictions (not that it has any choice: Apple, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/\">in contrast to the App Store</a>, doesn&#8217;t have any points of leverage over the open web), so it is fair to dismiss Wehner&#8217;s conspirational musings about the iPhone maker&#8217;s motivations.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the broader observation is a smart one: Google, thanks to the combination of being the default search engine on Safari and having a business built on the web, basically has first-party privileges on the iPhone when it comes to data. It can show ads to iPhone users on the default browser and track how those ads perform on third-party websites to a much greater extent than an app like Facebook directing users to the exact same third-party websites can.</p>\n<p>In terms of ATT, it is notable that the only part of Google&#8217;s business that fell short of Wall Street expectations was YouTube; I suspect it is not a coincidence that YouTube has a significant app-install business of its own, and ATT&#8217;s restrictions on what those installed apps can report back to Google may have hurt business a bit. At the same time, the same dynamics that drove advertising to other parts of Snap&#8217;s business and to Amazon advertising likely benefited Google as well, including Android.</p>\n<h4>Facebook Risk</h4>\n<p>There is no question that Facebook has been significantly impaired, but the company is by no means doomed, in large part because while search is very effective at finding what you want, there remains the need to make you aware of what you didn&#8217;t know existed. This is what Facebook excels at more than any other platform: by knowing who you are and what you have liked or purchased in the past, Facebook can place ads for products or apps you have never heard of in the Feed, in Stories, or, going forward in Reels.</p>\n<p>This, in my opinion, is actually a far more important form of advertising than search ads: yes, there are scenarios where a firm can surface something that fits exactly what you are searching for, but oftentimes search ads feel like <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-google-squeeze/\">a rake on organic results</a> that would have given you what you were looking for anyways. Facebook-style display advertising, on the other hand, is the foundation upon which an entirely new host of Internet-only businesses are built. These niche-focused companies are only possible when the entire world is your market, but they would founder without a way to find the customers who are looking for exactly what they have to offer; Facebook ads solve that problem.</p>\n<p>That discovery mechanism, though, doesn&#8217;t just depend on data; it also depends on attention. This is where the TikTok challenge looms large: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/metas-earnings-facebooks-three-challenges-financial-versus-existential-risks/\">Apple and ATT may have had the largest financial impact on Facebook, but TikTok and the loss of attention are the more existential risk</a>.</p>\n<h4>Illustrating the Ad Market</h4>\n<p>Still, Facebook&#8217;s forecast, disappointing as they were to investors, was for $27-29 billion in revenue this quarter; this is still a major player in an advertising market dominated by the three companies mentioned in this article, with one looming dark horse. To illustrate the market — and with the caveat that this is a <strong>massive</strong> oversimplification of what is a large and varied opportunity — consider a two-by-two defined by apps and commerce (both physical and digital) on one axis, and search and display on the other:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=640%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A two-by-two graph with search and display on one axis, and apps and commerce on the other\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8455\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=851%2C630&amp;ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This is what that market looked like back in 2016:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=640%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The 2x2 graph in 2016, when Google and Facebook were dominant\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8456\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=851%2C630&amp;ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This is what the market looks like in 2022:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=640%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The 2x2 graph in 2022, with challenges from Amazon and Apple\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8454\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=851%2C630&amp;ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>First off, note that this illustration doesn&#8217;t include a huge part of Google&#8217;s market, which is basically search for anything other than e-commerce. It also doesn&#8217;t include the still substantial market for brand advertising. Direct response advertising, though, is the truly Internet-native advertising form, and while Google and Facebook are important, note the two new entrants who have substantial advantages:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon:</strong></p>\n<p>Amazon has the best fulfillment and logistics operation in e-commerce,<sup id=\"rf2-8451\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#fn2-8451\" title=\"ex-China, anyways\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> which it uses to not only drive its own first-party retail but also third-party merchant services. Indeed, this is another way to think about how Amazon is insulated from ATT: it&#8217;s not that the company doesn&#8217;t have a multitude of third-party merchants on its platform, it is that by taking on the role of an Aggregator <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">instead of a platform</a> it gets to fold all of those third party merchants into its app and website, beyond the limitations enforceable by Apple. Then it effectively gives those third party merchants no choice but to buy ads if they want to be noticed by customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Apple:</strong></p>\n<p>Apple launched its App Store advertising business in the fall of 2016, starting with the most obvious place: search. Apple hasn&#8217;t disclosed how much it makes in advertising, but there are analyst estimates of <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/apple-search-ads-revenue/423997/\">$5 billion annually</a>. Not all of this is search — Apple has since added inventory in the App Store&#8217;s &#8220;Suggested&#8221; section as well as owned-and-operated apps like Apple News — but most of it is; Apple is confined to the top right corner…for now.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest questions about the advertising landscape going forward is if Apple is going to move down to the &#8220;Apps + Discovery&#8221; quadrant that remains Facebook&#8217;s purview. If the company did they would have an unbeatable advantage: remember, Apple has made clear through its App Store policies and testimony in the Epic case that it views apps on the App Store as first party <em>for Apple</em> (this is how <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/apple-ads-and-the-anti-steering-argument-additional-follow-up/\">the company justifies its anti-steering provisions</a>, likening links to websites to putting up signs in its own store for another, even though the signs in question are in the app and not the App Store). It follows, then, that Apple would see no inconsistency in denying Facebook the ability to have knowledge about installation and conversions derived from a Facebook ad, even as Apple has perfect knowledge of those installations and conversions from its own ads.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a hypothetical! Apple&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-advertising/\">Advertising &amp; Privacy page</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We may use information such as the following to assign you to segments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Information: Your name, address, age, gender, and devices registered to your Apple ID account. Information such as your first name in your Apple ID registration page or salutation in your Apple ID account may be used to derive your gender. You can update your account information on the Apple ID website.</li>\n<li>Downloads, Purchases &amp; Subscriptions: The music, movies, books, TV shows, and apps you download, as well as any in-app purchases and subscriptions. We don’t allow targeting based on downloads of a specific app or purchases within a specific app (including subscriptions) from the App Store, unless the targeting is done by that app’s developer.</li>\n<li>Apple News and Stocks: The topics and categories of the stories you read and the publications you follow, subscribe to, or enable notifications from.</li>\n<li>Advertising: Your interactions with ads delivered by Apple’s advertising platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  When selecting which ad to display from multiple ads for which you are eligible, we may use some of the above-mentioned information, as well as your App Store searches and browsing activity, to determine which ad is likely to be most relevant to you. App Store browsing activity includes the content and apps you tap and view while browsing the App Store. This information is aggregated across users so that it does not identify you. We may also use local, on-device processing to select which ad to display, using information stored on your device, such as the apps you frequently open.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, Apple does not currently allow developers to target downloads or purchases from within a specific app the developer does not own,<sup id=\"rf3-8451\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#fn3-8451\" title=\"This is why I have been intrigued by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2021/interoperability-defined-applovin-files-s-1-the-facebook-shopify-value-chain/&quot;&gt;AppLovin&#8217;s approach&lt;/a&gt;.\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> but that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple cannot; again, the company has made clear it sees every app on the iPhone — especially their purchases — as Apple data, and this document makes very clear that Apple only sees data collection as problematic when it involves third parties. To that end, Apple could set up an auction-based advertising network that monetized on a per-install basis and run those ads within an Apple-controlled network that is available to third-party apps. It would basically be a better version of Facebook — well, in theory, Apple has admittedly never been really good at this sort of thing — but since only Apple sees the data (just as only Facebook sees the data from third-party apps), Apple gets to pat itself on the back all of the way to the bank.</p>\n<p>This would, needless to say, be a breathtaking example of anti-competitive behavior; kneecapping your competitor via platform control and then taking over their business is what one would think antitrust law would be designed to stop. But then you look up and Apple has gotten away with its App Store policies for years, and Facebook is getting sued for limiting competition even as it faces an existential threat from TikTok, and who knows, maybe it would work.</p>\n<p>I hinted at one of the objections to this happening above: Apple has tried to do advertising before, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-scales-back-iads-the-apple-news-mess/\">and failed miserably</a>. As any Apple aficionado will tell you, ads aren&#8217;t in their nature, products are. But then again, had you told those same aficionados that Apple would be facing developer ire, antitrust lawsuits, and regulatory obstacles all over the world because of its insistence that it is owed 15-30% of all digital content consumed on the iPhone, they probably would have said that was impossible too. What is clear is that the $10 billion in revenue that Facebook won&#8217;t see this year will go somewhere, and Apple&#8217;s Services Narrative has never felt like a bigger opportunity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is a broader takeaway to this discussion; I wrote in the conclusion of 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/\">The End of the Beginning</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In other words, today’s cloud and mobile companies — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google — may very well be the GM, Ford, and Chrysler of the 21st century. The beginning era of technology, where new challengers were started every year, has come to an end; however, that does not mean the impact of technology is somehow diminished: it in fact means the impact is only getting started.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was one company conspicuous in its absence, and that was Facebook. Real power in technology comes from rooting the digital in something physical: for Amazon that is its fulfillment centers and logistics on the e-commerce side, and its data centers on the cloud side. For Microsoft it is its data centers and its global sales organization and multi-year relationships with basically every enterprise on earth. For Apple it is the iPhone, and for Google is is Android and its mutually beneficial relationship with Apple (this is less secure than Android, but that is why Google is paying an estimated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/05/google-pays-apple-stay-out-of-search/\">$15 billion</a> annually — and growing — to keep its position). Facebook benefited tremendously from being <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/mobile-makes-facebook-just-an-app-thats-great-news/\">just an app</a>, but the freedom of movement that entailed meant taking a dependency on iOS and Android, and Apple has exploited that dependency in part, if not yet in full.</p>\n<p>This, more than anything, is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-problem-with-virtual-reality/\">the way to understand the Meta bet</a>, and why <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/meta/\">it matters so much to CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Investors may want the company to focus on what it is best at; Zuckerberg wants to build a company that is truly independent of anyone.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-follow-up-spotify-rogan-follow-up/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-8451\"><p >Twitter did have a large run-up a year ago that has since disappeared&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#rf1-8451\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2-8451\"><p >ex-China, anyways&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#rf2-8451\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 2.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn3-8451\"><p >This is why I have been intrigued by <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/interoperability-defined-applovin-files-s-1-the-facebook-shopify-value-chain/\">AppLovin&#8217;s approach</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#rf3-8451\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 3.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "Six years ago tomorrow, in The Reality of Missing Out, I wrote that the digital advertising market was settled, and Google and Facebook won:\n\n  I have been arguing for a while that in the aggregate the tech sector is fine, and the state of advertising-based services is a perfect example of what I mean: taken as a basket the six companies in this article (Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Yelp) are up 19% over the last year, even though the latter four companies are down a collective 53%; the fact that Google and Facebook are up a combined 31% more than makes up for it.\n  This makes sense: while advertising as a whole is a zero-sum game, there is a secular shift from not just print but also radio and TV to digital, which is why this basket of digital advertising companies is up. Digital, though, is subject to the effects of Aggregation Theory, a key component of which is winner-take-all dynamics, and Facebook and Google are indeed taking it all.\n\nThe Article was prescient for a time; Yahoo has been passed around for peanuts, LinkedIn was bought by Microsoft a few months later, and while Yelp and Twitter’s stock have more-or-less doubled since then,1 that gain pales in comparison to that of Google and Facebook:\n\nThat chart, though, only runs through last Wednesday; here is the new chart post-Facebook earnings:\n\nIt turns out that, for now anyways, buying $TWTR on the day I wrote that article would have provided a better return than $FB.\nDirect Response and the Collapse of the Funnel\nIn that Article I painted an idealized picture of the traditional marketing funnel and how Google and Facebook’s advertising products mapped onto it:\n\n  What Sandberg is detailing here is really quite extraordinary: Facebook helped Shop Direct move customers through every part of the funnel: from awareness through Instagram video ads to consideration through retargeting and finally to conversion with dynamic product ads on Facebook (and, in the not too distant future, a direct customer relationship to build loyalty via Messenger).\n  \n  Google is promising something similar: awareness via properties like YouTube, consideration via DoubleClick, and conversion via AdSense. Just as importantly, both companies are promising that leveraging their respective platforms will provide benefits on both sides of the ROI equation: the return will be better given the two companies’ superior targeting capabilities and ability to measure conversion, and the investment will be smaller because you can manage your entire funnel from a single ad-buying interface.\n\nHerein lies the first thing that I got wrong: the traditional marketing funnel made sense in a world where different parts of the customer journey happened in different places — literally. You might see an advertisement on TV, then a coupon in the newspaper, and finally the product on an end cap in a store. Every one of those exposures was a discrete advertising event that culminated in the customer picking up the product in question in putting it in their (literal) shopping cart.\nOn the Internet, though, that journey is increasingly compressed into a single impression: you see an ad on Instagram, you click on it to find out more, you login with Shop Pay, and then you wonder what you were thinking when it shows up at your door a few days later. The loop for apps is even tighter: you see an ad, click an ‘Install’ button, and are playing a level just seconds later. Sure, there are things like re-targeting or list building, but by-and-large Internet advertising, particularly when it comes to Facebook, is almost all direct response.\nThis can make for an exceptionally resilient business model: because the return-on-investment (ROI) of direct response advertising is measurable to a fantastically greater degree than traditional advertising measurement, advertisers can spend right up to the level they place on a particular customer or transaction’s value; Facebook, of course, is willing to help them do that as easily as possible, squeezing out margin in the process. Moreover, because these ads are sold at auction, the company is insulated from events like COVID or boycotts; I explained in 2020’s Apple and Facebook:\n\n  This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.\n  In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a part.\n\nThe problem for Meta is in the title of that article: Apple. The latter’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) initiative severed the connection amongst e-commerce sellers, app developers, and Facebook by which Facebook achieved that ROI, and while the company is better positioned than anyone else to build a replacement, it is important to note that the impairment entailed in probabilistically measuring ad effectiveness instead of deterministically is a permanent one.\nThis isn’t just a Facebook problem: Snap said on its earnings call:\n\n  Our advertising partners who prefer to leverage lower-funnel goals such as in-app purchases, have been most impacted by [ATT]. We are seeing these advertisers migrate to mid-funnel goals where they have greater visibility such as install or click. Advertisers who optimize via web-based goal-based bids or GBBs have been less impacted, given that many of them have adopted the Snap pixel.\n\nSnap’s direct response business is not nearly as good as Facebook’s, and is a much smaller business both overall and in terms of the overall company’s revenue; that left a lot more cushion to absorb ATT, both because Snap’s performance had less to lose, and also because the company’s brand-business could help pick up the slack. This, paradoxically, led many investors to overfit Facebook’s disappointing forecast to Snap’s outlook; the reality is that advertising dollars will find a way to be spent, and the alternatives to direct response on Snap were more impactful to the bottom line than they are on Facebook, in part because the latter was so dominant in direct response until now.\nThe Amazon Advertising IPO\nWhat made the Facebook model tick was the way in which the company could convert conversion tracking to targeting: because Facebook knew a lot about someone who saw an ad and then converted, they could easily find other people who were similar — lookalike audiences — and show them similar ads, continually optimizing their targeting and increasing their understanding along the way.\nGoogle Search, though, has a built-in advantage: Google doesn’t have to figure out what you are interested in because you do the company the favor of telling it by searching for it. The odds that you want a hotel in San Francisco are rather high if you search for “San Francisco hotels”; it’s the same thing with life insurance or car mechanics or e-commerce.\nGoogle is not the only search engine that monetizes e-commerce effectively. Back in 2015 I described the breakout of Amazon Web Services’ financials as The AWS IPO:\n\n  This is why Amazon’s latest earnings were such a big deal: for the first time the company broke out AWS into its own line item, revealing not just its revenue (which could be teased out previously) but also its profitability. And, to many people’s surprise, and despite all the price cuts, AWS is very profitable: $265 million in profit on $1.57 billion in sales last quarter alone, for an impressive (for Amazon!) 17% net margin.\n\nThose numbers pale in comparison to what I guess we might call the Amazon Advertising IPO, given that the company broke out its advertising for the first time this quarter, revealing $9.7 billion in revenue, a 32% increase year-over-year (Amazon did not break out the unit’s profitability). While that is still a fraction of Google’s $61.2 billion last quarter, or Facebook’s $32.6 billion, it is a larger fraction than you might expect, and several multiples of Snap’s $1.3 billion in revenue. Indeed, given the fact that Amazon is closer in revenue to Facebook than Facebook is to Google it seems fair to characterize the advertising market as dominated not by a big two but a big three.\nAmazon’s advertising business has three big advantages relative to Facebook’s.\n\nSearch advertising is the best and most profitable form of advertising. This goes back to the point I made above: the more certain you are that you are showing advertising to a receptive customer, the more advertisers are willing to bid for that ad slot, and text in a search box will always be more accurate than the best targeting.\n\n\nAmazon faces no data restrictions. That noted, Amazon also has data on its users, and it is free to collect as much of it as it likes, and leverage it however it wishes when it comes to selling ads. This is because all of Amazon’s data collection, ad targeting, and conversion happen on the same platform — Amazon.com, or the Amazon app. ATT only restricts third party data sharing, which means it doesn’t affect Amazon at all.\n\n\nAmazon benefits from ATT spillover. That is not to say that ATT didn’t have an effect on Amazon: I noted above that Snap’s business did better than expected in part because its business wasn’t dominated by direct advertising to the extent that Facebook’s was, and that more advertising money flowed into other types of advertising. This almost certainly made a difference for Amazon as well: one of the most affected areas of Facebook advertising was e-commerce; if you are an e-commerce seller whose Shopify store powered-by Facebook ads was suddenly under-performing thanks to ATT, then the natural response is to shift products and advertising spend to Amazon.\n\n\nAll of these advantages will persist: search advertising will always be effective, and Amazon can always leverage data, and while some degree of ATT-related pullback was likely due to both uncertainty and the fact that Facebook hasn’t built back its advertising stack for a post-ATT world, the fact that said future stack will never be quite as good as the old one means that there is more e-commerce share to be grabbed than there might have been otherwise.\nGoogle’s Dominance\nOf course you could just as easily make an argument that when it comes to digital advertising there is Google and everyone else. Google clearly faces competition from Amazon for e-commerce search advertising — the European Commission’s Google Shopping case is only surpassed by the FTC’s Facebook lawsuit when it comes to overly narrow market definitions that ignore reality — but is dominant in terms of nearly every other vertical. Moreover, that dominance is shored up by the same factors favoring Amazon, at least in part.\nThe first one is obvious: search advertising works great, and Google is the best at it.\nThe second one, about data collection, is more interesting, particularly in the context of ATT. Facebook CFO Dave Wehner groused on the company’s recent earnings call:\n\n  We believe the impact of iOS overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of $10 billion, so it’s a pretty significant headwind for our business. And we’re seeing that impact in a number of verticals. E-commerce was an area where we saw a meaningful slowdown in growth in Q4. And similarly, we’ve seen other areas like gaming be challenged. But on e-commerce, it’s quite notable that Google called out, seeing strength in that very same vertical. And so given that we know that e-commerce is one of the most impacted verticals from iOS restrictions, it makes sense that those restrictions are probably part of the explanation for the difference between what they were seeing and what we were seeing.\n  And if you look at it, we believe those restrictions from Apple are designed in a way that carves out browsers from the tracking prompts Apple requires for apps. And so what that means is that search ads could have access to far more third-party data for measurement and optimization purposes than app-based ad platforms like ours. So when it comes to using data, that it’s not really apples-to-apples for us. And as a result, we believe Google’s search ads business could have benefited relative to services like ours that face a different set of restrictions from Apple. And given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search ads, the incentive clearly exists for this policy discrepancy to continue.\n\nApple, it should be noted, has always treated the browser as a carve-out from its App Store restrictions (not that it has any choice: Apple, in contrast to the App Store, doesn’t have any points of leverage over the open web), so it is fair to dismiss Wehner’s conspirational musings about the iPhone maker’s motivations.\nAt the same time, the broader observation is a smart one: Google, thanks to the combination of being the default search engine on Safari and having a business built on the web, basically has first-party privileges on the iPhone when it comes to data. It can show ads to iPhone users on the default browser and track how those ads perform on third-party websites to a much greater extent than an app like Facebook directing users to the exact same third-party websites can.\nIn terms of ATT, it is notable that the only part of Google’s business that fell short of Wall Street expectations was YouTube; I suspect it is not a coincidence that YouTube has a significant app-install business of its own, and ATT’s restrictions on what those installed apps can report back to Google may have hurt business a bit. At the same time, the same dynamics that drove advertising to other parts of Snap’s business and to Amazon advertising likely benefited Google as well, including Android.\nFacebook Risk\nThere is no question that Facebook has been significantly impaired, but the company is by no means doomed, in large part because while search is very effective at finding what you want, there remains the need to make you aware of what you didn’t know existed. This is what Facebook excels at more than any other platform: by knowing who you are and what you have liked or purchased in the past, Facebook can place ads for products or apps you have never heard of in the Feed, in Stories, or, going forward in Reels.\nThis, in my opinion, is actually a far more important form of advertising than search ads: yes, there are scenarios where a firm can surface something that fits exactly what you are searching for, but oftentimes search ads feel like a rake on organic results that would have given you what you were looking for anyways. Facebook-style display advertising, on the other hand, is the foundation upon which an entirely new host of Internet-only businesses are built. These niche-focused companies are only possible when the entire world is your market, but they would founder without a way to find the customers who are looking for exactly what they have to offer; Facebook ads solve that problem.\nThat discovery mechanism, though, doesn’t just depend on data; it also depends on attention. This is where the TikTok challenge looms large: Apple and ATT may have had the largest financial impact on Facebook, but TikTok and the loss of attention are the more existential risk.\nIllustrating the Ad Market\nStill, Facebook’s forecast, disappointing as they were to investors, was for $27-29 billion in revenue this quarter; this is still a major player in an advertising market dominated by the three companies mentioned in this article, with one looming dark horse. To illustrate the market — and with the caveat that this is a massive oversimplification of what is a large and varied opportunity — consider a two-by-two defined by apps and commerce (both physical and digital) on one axis, and search and display on the other:\n\nThis is what that market looked like back in 2016:\n\nThis is what the market looks like in 2022:\n\nFirst off, note that this illustration doesn’t include a huge part of Google’s market, which is basically search for anything other than e-commerce. It also doesn’t include the still substantial market for brand advertising. Direct response advertising, though, is the truly Internet-native advertising form, and while Google and Facebook are important, note the two new entrants who have substantial advantages:\nAmazon:\nAmazon has the best fulfillment and logistics operation in e-commerce,2 which it uses to not only drive its own first-party retail but also third-party merchant services. Indeed, this is another way to think about how Amazon is insulated from ATT: it’s not that the company doesn’t have a multitude of third-party merchants on its platform, it is that by taking on the role of an Aggregator instead of a platform it gets to fold all of those third party merchants into its app and website, beyond the limitations enforceable by Apple. Then it effectively gives those third party merchants no choice but to buy ads if they want to be noticed by customers.\nApple:\nApple launched its App Store advertising business in the fall of 2016, starting with the most obvious place: search. Apple hasn’t disclosed how much it makes in advertising, but there are analyst estimates of $5 billion annually. Not all of this is search — Apple has since added inventory in the App Store’s “Suggested” section as well as owned-and-operated apps like Apple News — but most of it is; Apple is confined to the top right corner…for now.\nOne of the biggest questions about the advertising landscape going forward is if Apple is going to move down to the “Apps + Discovery” quadrant that remains Facebook’s purview. If the company did they would have an unbeatable advantage: remember, Apple has made clear through its App Store policies and testimony in the Epic case that it views apps on the App Store as first party for Apple (this is how the company justifies its anti-steering provisions, likening links to websites to putting up signs in its own store for another, even though the signs in question are in the app and not the App Store). It follows, then, that Apple would see no inconsistency in denying Facebook the ability to have knowledge about installation and conversions derived from a Facebook ad, even as Apple has perfect knowledge of those installations and conversions from its own ads.\nThis isn’t a hypothetical! Apple’s Advertising & Privacy page states:\n\n  We may use information such as the following to assign you to segments:\n\nAccount Information: Your name, address, age, gender, and devices registered to your Apple ID account. Information such as your first name in your Apple ID registration page or salutation in your Apple ID account may be used to derive your gender. You can update your account information on the Apple ID website.\nDownloads, Purchases & Subscriptions: The music, movies, books, TV shows, and apps you download, as well as any in-app purchases and subscriptions. We don’t allow targeting based on downloads of a specific app or purchases within a specific app (including subscriptions) from the App Store, unless the targeting is done by that app’s developer.\nApple News and Stocks: The topics and categories of the stories you read and the publications you follow, subscribe to, or enable notifications from.\nAdvertising: Your interactions with ads delivered by Apple’s advertising platform.\n\n  When selecting which ad to display from multiple ads for which you are eligible, we may use some of the above-mentioned information, as well as your App Store searches and browsing activity, to determine which ad is likely to be most relevant to you. App Store browsing activity includes the content and apps you tap and view while browsing the App Store. This information is aggregated across users so that it does not identify you. We may also use local, on-device processing to select which ad to display, using information stored on your device, such as the apps you frequently open.\n\nAs you can see, Apple does not currently allow developers to target downloads or purchases from within a specific app the developer does not own,3 but that doesn’t mean Apple cannot; again, the company has made clear it sees every app on the iPhone — especially their purchases — as Apple data, and this document makes very clear that Apple only sees data collection as problematic when it involves third parties. To that end, Apple could set up an auction-based advertising network that monetized on a per-install basis and run those ads within an Apple-controlled network that is available to third-party apps. It would basically be a better version of Facebook — well, in theory, Apple has admittedly never been really good at this sort of thing — but since only Apple sees the data (just as only Facebook sees the data from third-party apps), Apple gets to pat itself on the back all of the way to the bank.\nThis would, needless to say, be a breathtaking example of anti-competitive behavior; kneecapping your competitor via platform control and then taking over their business is what one would think antitrust law would be designed to stop. But then you look up and Apple has gotten away with its App Store policies for years, and Facebook is getting sued for limiting competition even as it faces an existential threat from TikTok, and who knows, maybe it would work.\nI hinted at one of the objections to this happening above: Apple has tried to do advertising before, and failed miserably. As any Apple aficionado will tell you, ads aren’t in their nature, products are. But then again, had you told those same aficionados that Apple would be facing developer ire, antitrust lawsuits, and regulatory obstacles all over the world because of its insistence that it is owed 15-30% of all digital content consumed on the iPhone, they probably would have said that was impossible too. What is clear is that the $10 billion in revenue that Facebook won’t see this year will go somewhere, and Apple’s Services Narrative has never felt like a bigger opportunity.\n\nThere is a broader takeaway to this discussion; I wrote in the conclusion of 2020’s The End of the Beginning:\n\n  In other words, today’s cloud and mobile companies — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google — may very well be the GM, Ford, and Chrysler of the 21st century. The beginning era of technology, where new challengers were started every year, has come to an end; however, that does not mean the impact of technology is somehow diminished: it in fact means the impact is only getting started.\n\nThere was one company conspicuous in its absence, and that was Facebook. Real power in technology comes from rooting the digital in something physical: for Amazon that is its fulfillment centers and logistics on the e-commerce side, and its data centers on the cloud side. For Microsoft it is its data centers and its global sales organization and multi-year relationships with basically every enterprise on earth. For Apple it is the iPhone, and for Google is is Android and its mutually beneficial relationship with Apple (this is less secure than Android, but that is why Google is paying an estimated $15 billion annually — and growing — to keep its position). Facebook benefited tremendously from being just an app, but the freedom of movement that entailed meant taking a dependency on iOS and Android, and Apple has exploited that dependency in part, if not yet in full.\nThis, more than anything, is the way to understand the Meta bet, and why it matters so much to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Investors may want the company to focus on what it is best at; Zuckerberg wants to build a company that is truly independent of anyone.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.\nTwitter did have a large run-up a year ago that has since disappeared ↩ex-China, anyways ↩This is why I have been intrigued by AppLovin’s approach. ↩",

In the pre-ATT world everyone from e-commerce sellers to app developers could effectively offload the collection and analysis of conversion data and subsequent targeting of advertising to Facebook, to the benefit of everyone involved: individual developers and retailers did not need to bear the risk or expense of collecting and analyzing data, and could instead collectively outsource that job to the Facebook <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/data-factories/\">data factory</a>, which had the benefit of making Facebook advertising that much more effective, not only to the benefit of Facebook&#8217;s bottom line but also to that of those that relied on its advertising platform.</p>\n<p>ATT, meanwhile, didn&#8217;t ban data collection or analysis or targeting or any of the other aspects of advertising that many of its supporters object to; what it targeted was doing so collectively. That means that the policy has been a huge boon for fully integrated advertisers (i.e. advertisers that collect data, target, and show advertisements) like Google and Amazon. In this world the natural response has been consolidation; compare Zynga&#8217;s stock price over the last year to a company <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/interoperability-defined-applovin-files-s-1-the-facebook-shopify-value-chain/\">like AppLovin</a> which was ahead of the curve in buying up multiple parts of the ad stack and combining them with its own titles to maximize the value of first party data:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-1.png?resize=640%2C248&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Zynga versus AppLovin stock performance over the last year\" width=\"640\" height=\"248\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8395\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-1.png?resize=1024%2C397&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-1.png?resize=300%2C116&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-1.png?resize=768%2C298&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-1.png?resize=1200%2C465&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>AppLovin is down a bit with the general market drawdown, but it&#8217;s not an accident the company increased in price last fall while Zynga plummeted (the stock is up from its depths because of the not-yet-closed acquisition): one of <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/how-zynga-executed-its-stunning-turnaround/\">the keys to Zynga&#8217;s turnaround</a> was buying small independent studios and letting them stay independent; that&#8217;s no longer a viable approach in a post-ATT world, and Take-Two will have to centralize Zynga and only then leverage Zynga’s expertise to bring its valuable IP to mobile platforms in a much more complete way than it has previously.</p>\n<h4>Microsoft and Xbox Game Pass</h4>\n<p>Take-Two wasn&#8217;t the only company taking advantage of a company with a plummeting stock price; Microsoft did the same with Activision Blizzard:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-2.png?resize=640%2C248&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Activision&#039;s stock price over the last year\" width=\"640\" height=\"248\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-2.png?resize=1024%2C397&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-2.png?resize=300%2C116&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-2.png?resize=768%2C298&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-2.png?resize=1200%2C465&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gamingsmilingcurve-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Activision Blizzard does own King Digital, which still provides over $2 billion in revenue from <em>Candy Crush</em> and its various spin-offs, but in this case the stock price decline was primarily due to <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture\">major issues regarding Activision Blizzard&#8217;s internal culture, including a lawsuit by the state of California</a>. Microsoft, though, was well positioned to take advantage of Activision Blizzard&#8217;s troubles thanks to Xbox Game Pass.</p>\n<p>Whenever a major platform acquires a developer on that platform, the first question users ask is if the platform owner will make the developer&#8217;s content exclusive. It&#8217;s an obvious question — why else would the platform owner buy it, given that they can still collect revenue from the developer, both directly via platform fees and indirectly via licensing fees? — but the answer is not always straightforward, thanks to the nature of software.</p>\n<p>Software, including games, entails a massive investment in upfront development costs. You have to build (or license and adapt to) a game engine, write and build out the story, draw and develop the assets, etc. All of this is work that is both expensive and also only needs to be done once; it follows, then, that it is in the software developer&#8217;s economic interest to make the game available as widely as possible; after all, every additional copy of a game has zero marginal costs, which means that every additional copy of a game sold provides nothing but leverage on those fixed costs, and, once covered, pure profit (that noted, there are significant costs associated with supporting multiple platforms — I have seen estimates around 25~40% of extra costs, depending on the game — so going exclusive is not an entirely deadweight cost).</p>\n<p>This makes the math around developer acquisitions a bit tricky for platform acquirers: to buy a gaming studio in order to make its games exclusive to the platform entails destroying a significant part of the game studio&#8217;s economic value; after all, you are acquiring a property like <em>Call of Duty</em> based on the revenue it grosses from PC, Xbox, and PlayStation — cutting off the latter means you overpaid. This is why it is not a surprise that Microsoft has already committed to keeping Activision Blizzard&#8217;s and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/microsoft-and-zenimax-microsoft-ignite-microsoft-and-covid/\">ZeniMax&#8217;s</a> most popular cross-platform games on PlayStation.</p>\n<p>What makes Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition spree particularly compelling, though, is that Microsoft is trying to create a new business model for gaming: for $15/month you can play all of the games Microsoft owns, and those of any third-party developer who wishes to join up, on any platform that supports them. This includes not only the Xbox console and Windows PCs,<sup id=\"rf2-8394\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/#fn2-8394\" title=\"Each of which has a standalone $10/month plan\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> but also the nascent Xbox streaming service, which makes console-level games available on mobile and PC and, soon enough, smart TVs or a potential Xbox streaming stick. This is a business model that not only makes sense given the evolution of technology towards cloud-centric services, but is also <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/microsofts-monopoly-hangover/\">in-line with Microsoft&#8217;s core competency and fundamental nature</a>.</p>\n<p>More importantly, at least in the context of this Article, is the freedom of movement this gives Microsoft when it comes to acquisitions: all of ZeniMax&#8217;s titles, and many of Activision Blizzard&#8217;s titles in the future, are still available on PlayStation and Steam as individual purchases; if that is how you want to pay then Microsoft will accept your money, and avoid the loss of cutting you off. All of those games, though, are also available on Xbox Game Pass, because Microsoft is betting that many gamers will realize it&#8217;s a pretty good deal, even as it aligns with the company&#8217;s corporate goal of creating lifelong customers paying via subscription.</p>\n<h4>Sony and Exclusives</h4>\n<p>Major deals like Sony&#8217;s acquisition of Bungie, the once-makers of Halo (while owned by Microsoft) and current developers of Destiny (for which they negotiated their freedom), obviously don&#8217;t come together in two weeks. It&#8217;s tempting, though, to view it as defensive: if Microsoft were to withdraw a property like the afore-mentioned <em>Call of Duty</em>, well, Sony can always take away <em>Destiny.</em></p>\n<p>The truth, though, is that this is simply the most visible of a long line of acquisitions, going back two decades to Sony&#8217;s 2001 acquisition of Naughty Dog, of studios that make content for consoles that is worth switching over. Naughty Dog has made <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>, and <em>The Last of Us</em>; Incognito made the <em>Twisted Metal</em> series; Guerrilla Games made the <em>Killzone</em> and <em>Horizon</em> series; Sucker Punch made <em>Sly Cooper</em>, <em>Infamous</em>, and the <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>; Insomniac made <em>Ratchet and Clank</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>; Bluepoint Games made <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em>; all were PlayStation exclusives, credited with Sony&#8217;s dominance over the last two console generations.</p>\n<p>Sony, rather than chasing Microsoft, appears set for a more Nintendo-like trajectory: customers will buy their consoles because they have exclusive games that you can&#8217;t get anywhere else; unlike Nintendo, Sony consoles are on the cutting edge technologically, which means that the remaining 3rd-party publishers like EA will continue to support them. Sure, Microsoft has a good subscription, but Sony has games you can&#8217;t get anywhere else (and, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass\">rumors suggest</a>, a new subscription service of its own, although it may not have the best titles available immediately, which makes sense given Sony&#8217;s strategy).</p>\n<p>That is why I expect Bungie to continue to support <em>Destiny</em> across multiple platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, and PC), <strike>while new content beyond the upcoming <em>Witch Queen</em> expansion is probably going to come out on PlayStation first; whatever title lies beyond that, meanwhile, has a good chance of being PlayStation only (if you haven&#8217;t spent the money on supporting multiple platforms, it is an easier choice to be an exclusive).</strike></p>\n<p><em>Update: Bungie made clear in <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50989\">an FAQ</a> that future Destiny content would be available on the first day on all platforms, which makes sense given that Destiny supports cross-play.

The response from content makers, then, has been to consolidate and increase the leverage that comes from differentiated content.</p>\n<p>Xbox Game Pass, meanwhile, is an attempt to build a position as an Aggregator; the initiative will be successful to the extent that gamers play games because they are in Game Pass, and increasingly shun games that have to be purchased individually (incentivizing holdouts to join Microsoft&#8217;s subscription). Microsoft is kick-starting this effort by buying its own differentiated content and overlaying their long-term incentives over any individual game studio’s incentives to maximize their short-term revenue by selling a game individually.</p>\n<p>Sony is pursuing a similar strategy, but with a different business model: whereas Microsoft is increasingly device-agnostic (of course it helps that they sell both Xbox consoles and Windows), Sony is doubling down on the integration of hardware and software. Their best content is designed to not only make money in its own right but to also persuade customers to buy PlayStation consoles; the more PlayStation consoles there are the more attractive the platform is to 3rd-party developers.</p>\n<p>What is much less viable is anything in the middle. The original PlayStation was almost completely dependent on 3rd-party games, relying on technical superiority to build its user base and attract developers; that approach reached its limit with the relative disappointment that was the PlayStation 3, and Sony has been focused on exclusives ever since. Content developers like Zynga, meanwhile, can&#8217;t depend on companies in the middle either: Apple&#8217;s rules have ensured that anyone who is not an Aggregator has to figure out how to make money on their own. There is still a market for 3rd-party developers on consoles and PCs — Steam is a major Aggregator on the latter, challenged by not just Microsoft but also Epic, who all are competing for the best developers — but it is increasingly important that content be highly differentiated and costs tightly contained.</p>\n<h4>The Upside of Acquisitions</h4>\n<p>There are a lot of seemingly scary implications in this analysis, including concepts like exclusives, lock-in, and the sense that the big are getting bigger. I think there is a strong argument, though, that the overall impact on consumers is on balance a positive one. Gaming, to a much greater extent than many other industries, is a zero sum game: time spent playing one title is time not spent playing another one. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for any particular gaming platform, relative to the time spent playing games, is a very favorable one. With regards to the latter point, the price of having access to everything is not an overwhelming one; with regards to the former the incentives to make a game that is truly exceptional, and thus truly differentiated, are higher than ever.</p>\n<p>Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, made an argument along these lines when I challenged him in a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/microsoft-acquires-activision-blizzard-notes-on-the-acquisition-an-interview-with-microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer/\">Stratechery interview</a> about a potential loss of competition entailed in the company&#8217;s Activision Blizzard acquisition:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Ah. I mean, that’s maybe where we’ll differ in opinion. Some of this just comes down to the teams that become part of our team and our cultural journey with them that starts long ago. This will sound a little bit like a kind of gaming person, but I’ll say the thing that I have found that drives the teams internally to our organization is they want to do things they’ve never been able to do before. They want to reach more players of their creations than they’ve ever been able to create before. And I might argue the opposite, that the churn of “I need another holiday release next year” and then the year after and then the year after can be more stifle on creativity than the freedom that we’re able to give that says, “It’s not about one business model that works for us, it’s actually about multiple business models. It’s not about one screen that people will consume your game on. You pick the screen that’s right for you. And the input, if you want keyboard or mouse, you want touch, you want controller, you pick.

The amount of energy they had for learning from other teams, because creators can get isolated because they’re so focused on the thing they’re doing right now.

The energy in the room was awesome, it was a virtual room in a Teams call, but it was still awesome. I would say that that freedom to innovate, to try new things, because it’s not just down to one business model or one screen or even one device that somebody might buy is the thing that I found is most liberating for the teams here.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Of course that’s the answer I would expect.</strong></p>\n<p>  <strong>PS:</strong> (laughing)</p>\n<p>  <strong>I think that one of the early questions about this deal is basically — the big company doesn’t think competition is particularly useful or valuable. “We want to give people freedom to explore.”</strong></p>\n<p>  <strong>PS:</strong> Well, let me hit on that one. Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt, but let me hit on competition really quick, because I see competition as a little bit different. There’s a ton of competition in the games business. If I rewind 30 years ago, the video game business was dictated by who had shelf space at Egghead because there was such a constriction on distribution and funding and marketing of games that the portfolio of games I could choose from was so limited. I love the fact that when I look at the top 10 games that are being played, how many come from traditional places versus how many now are coming from creators that didn’t even exist 10 years ago.

This has dramatically increased the power of creators, who can not only go direct, but also plays Aggregators off against each other — that is the realm of competition that matters. If we must accept a world where platforms like the App Store have total power within their domains, then the answer is to build up alternative Aggregators that have compelling content of their own, waging a proper fight for the only scarce resource there is on the Internet: time.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-8394\"><p >I will save the Wordle acquisition for another day!&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/#rf1-8394\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2-8394\"><p >Each of which has a standalone $10/month plan&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/#rf2-8394\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 2.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "Another week, another gaming acquisition. First Take-Two acquired Zynga, then Microsoft acquired Activision-Blizzard, and now Sony just announced the acquisition of Bungie.1 Each of these acquisitions is interesting in its own right, but taken as a set they paint a picture of industry evolution that extends far beyond gaming.\nTake-Two and Mobile Consolidation\nThe straightforward explanation for Take-Two’s acquisition of Zynga is the fact that mobile captures more than 50% of gaming industry revenue and it is growing much faster (7% last year) than PC and console gaming (the gaming industry grew 1.4% as a whole); that is a problem for Take-Two given that nearly all of the company’s revenue comes from PC and console series like Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K, Red Dead, Bordlerlands, and more.\nZynga, meanwhile, was among the least prepared of the major mobile gaming companies for the changes wrought by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy, which was introduced with iOS 14 and rolled out over the first half of 2021. In the pre-ATT world everyone from e-commerce sellers to app developers could effectively offload the collection and analysis of conversion data and subsequent targeting of advertising to Facebook, to the benefit of everyone involved: individual developers and retailers did not need to bear the risk or expense of collecting and analyzing data, and could instead collectively outsource that job to the Facebook data factory, which had the benefit of making Facebook advertising that much more effective, not only to the benefit of Facebook’s bottom line but also to that of those that relied on its advertising platform.\nATT, meanwhile, didn’t ban data collection or analysis or targeting or any of the other aspects of advertising that many of its supporters object to; what it targeted was doing so collectively. That means that the policy has been a huge boon for fully integrated advertisers (i.e. advertisers that collect data, target, and show advertisements) like Google and Amazon. In this world the natural response has been consolidation; compare Zynga’s stock price over the last year to a company like AppLovin which was ahead of the curve in buying up multiple parts of the ad stack and combining them with its own titles to maximize the value of first party data:\n\nAppLovin is down a bit with the general market drawdown, but it’s not an accident the company increased in price last fall while Zynga plummeted (the stock is up from its depths because of the not-yet-closed acquisition): one of the keys to Zynga’s turnaround was buying small independent studios and letting them stay independent; that’s no longer a viable approach in a post-ATT world, and Take-Two will have to centralize Zynga and only then leverage Zynga’s expertise to bring its valuable IP to mobile platforms in a much more complete way than it has previously.\nMicrosoft and Xbox Game Pass\nTake-Two wasn’t the only company taking advantage of a company with a plummeting stock price; Microsoft did the same with Activision Blizzard:\n\nActivision Blizzard does own King Digital, which still provides over $2 billion in revenue from Candy Crush and its various spin-offs, but in this case the stock price decline was primarily due to major issues regarding Activision Blizzard’s internal culture, including a lawsuit by the state of California. Microsoft, though, was well positioned to take advantage of Activision Blizzard’s troubles thanks to Xbox Game Pass.\nWhenever a major platform acquires a developer on that platform, the first question users ask is if the platform owner will make the developer’s content exclusive. It’s an obvious question — why else would the platform owner buy it, given that they can still collect revenue from the developer, both directly via platform fees and indirectly via licensing fees? — but the answer is not always straightforward, thanks to the nature of software.\nSoftware, including games, entails a massive investment in upfront development costs. You have to build (or license and adapt to) a game engine, write and build out the story, draw and develop the assets, etc. All of this is work that is both expensive and also only needs to be done once; it follows, then, that it is in the software developer’s economic interest to make the game available as widely as possible; after all, every additional copy of a game has zero marginal costs, which means that every additional copy of a game sold provides nothing but leverage on those fixed costs, and, once covered, pure profit (that noted, there are significant costs associated with supporting multiple platforms — I have seen estimates around 25~40% of extra costs, depending on the game — so going exclusive is not an entirely deadweight cost).\nThis makes the math around developer acquisitions a bit tricky for platform acquirers: to buy a gaming studio in order to make its games exclusive to the platform entails destroying a significant part of the game studio’s economic value; after all, you are acquiring a property like Call of Duty based on the revenue it grosses from PC, Xbox, and PlayStation — cutting off the latter means you overpaid. This is why it is not a surprise that Microsoft has already committed to keeping Activision Blizzard’s and ZeniMax’s most popular cross-platform games on PlayStation.\nWhat makes Microsoft’s acquisition spree particularly compelling, though, is that Microsoft is trying to create a new business model for gaming: for $15/month you can play all of the games Microsoft owns, and those of any third-party developer who wishes to join up, on any platform that supports them. This includes not only the Xbox console and Windows PCs,2 but also the nascent Xbox streaming service, which makes console-level games available on mobile and PC and, soon enough, smart TVs or a potential Xbox streaming stick. This is a business model that not only makes sense given the evolution of technology towards cloud-centric services, but is also in-line with Microsoft’s core competency and fundamental nature.\nMore importantly, at least in the context of this Article, is the freedom of movement this gives Microsoft when it comes to acquisitions: all of ZeniMax’s titles, and many of Activision Blizzard’s titles in the future, are still available on PlayStation and Steam as individual purchases; if that is how you want to pay then Microsoft will accept your money, and avoid the loss of cutting you off. All of those games, though, are also available on Xbox Game Pass, because Microsoft is betting that many gamers will realize it’s a pretty good deal, even as it aligns with the company’s corporate goal of creating lifelong customers paying via subscription.\nSony and Exclusives\nMajor deals like Sony’s acquisition of Bungie, the once-makers of Halo (while owned by Microsoft) and current developers of Destiny (for which they negotiated their freedom), obviously don’t come together in two weeks. It’s tempting, though, to view it as defensive: if Microsoft were to withdraw a property like the afore-mentioned Call of Duty, well, Sony can always take away Destiny.\nThe truth, though, is that this is simply the most visible of a long line of acquisitions, going back two decades to Sony’s 2001 acquisition of Naughty Dog, of studios that make content for consoles that is worth switching over. Naughty Dog has made Crash Bandicoot, Uncharted, and The Last of Us; Incognito made the Twisted Metal series; Guerrilla Games made the Killzone and Horizon series; Sucker Punch made Sly Cooper, Infamous, and the Ghost of Tsushima; Insomniac made Ratchet and Clank and Spider-Man; Bluepoint Games made Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls; all were PlayStation exclusives, credited with Sony’s dominance over the last two console generations.\nSony, rather than chasing Microsoft, appears set for a more Nintendo-like trajectory: customers will buy their consoles because they have exclusive games that you can’t get anywhere else; unlike Nintendo, Sony consoles are on the cutting edge technologically, which means that the remaining 3rd-party publishers like EA will continue to support them. Sure, Microsoft has a good subscription, but Sony has games you can’t get anywhere else (and, rumors suggest, a new subscription service of its own, although it may not have the best titles available immediately, which makes sense given Sony’s strategy).\nThat is why I expect Bungie to continue to support Destiny across multiple platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, and PC), while new content beyond the upcoming Witch Queen expansion is probably going to come out on PlayStation first; whatever title lies beyond that, meanwhile, has a good chance of being PlayStation only (if you haven’t spent the money on supporting multiple platforms, it is an easier choice to be an exclusive).\nUpdate: Bungie made clear in an FAQ that future Destiny content would be available on the first day on all platforms, which makes sense given that Destiny supports cross-play. Moreover, the same FAQ states that any IP beyond Destiny would also be cross-platform; this doesn’t detract from the general point about Sony and exclusives, but it certainly suggests that doesn’t apply in this case. This was an error on my part and I apologize.\nGaming and the Smiling Curve\nThe Smiling Curve, as I first explained in this 2014 Article, was a concept created by Acer founder Stan Shih to explain where the profits were in technological manufacturing; from Wikipedia:\n\n  A smiling curve is an illustration of value-adding potentials of different components of the value chain in an IT-related manufacturing industry…According to Shih’s observation, in the personal computer industry, both ends of the value chain command higher values added to the product than the middle part of the value chain. If this phenomenon is presented in a graph with a Y-axis for value-added and an X-axis for value chain (stage of production), the resulting curve appears like a “smile”.\n  \n\nI argued at the time that this framework was applicable to the publishing industry:\n\n  When people follow a link on Facebook (or Google or Twitter or even in an email), the page view that results is not generated because the viewer has any particular affinity for the publication that is hosting the link, and it is uncertain at best whether or not their affinity will increase once they’ve read the article. If anything, the reader is likely to ascribe any positive feelings to the author, perhaps taking a peek at their archives or Twitter feed.\n  Over time, as this cycle repeats itself and as people grow increasingly accustomed to getting most of their “news” from Facebook (or Google or Twitter), value moves to the ends, just like it did in the IT manufacturing industry or smartphone industry:\n  \n\nI think this framework is also the best way to think about all of these acquisitions. To generalize the concept, the top right of the curve are companies that have a direct connection with customers, including the Aggregators; the top left are highly differentiated content makers:\n\nWhen it comes to mobile gaming, the dominant Aggregators on the top right side of the curve are Apple and Google and their respective App Stores; the most cynical interpretation of ATT is that Facebook was superseding both to become the most important way in which people discovered apps, and Apple, thanks to its OS-level control, cut them off at the knees, pushing Facebook down to the middle. The response from content makers, then, has been to consolidate and increase the leverage that comes from differentiated content.\nXbox Game Pass, meanwhile, is an attempt to build a position as an Aggregator; the initiative will be successful to the extent that gamers play games because they are in Game Pass, and increasingly shun games that have to be purchased individually (incentivizing holdouts to join Microsoft’s subscription). Microsoft is kick-starting this effort by buying its own differentiated content and overlaying their long-term incentives over any individual game studio’s incentives to maximize their short-term revenue by selling a game individually.\nSony is pursuing a similar strategy, but with a different business model: whereas Microsoft is increasingly device-agnostic (of course it helps that they sell both Xbox consoles and Windows), Sony is doubling down on the integration of hardware and software. Their best content is designed to not only make money in its own right but to also persuade customers to buy PlayStation consoles; the more PlayStation consoles there are the more attractive the platform is to 3rd-party developers.\nWhat is much less viable is anything in the middle.

There is still a market for 3rd-party developers on consoles and PCs — Steam is a major Aggregator on the latter, challenged by not just Microsoft but also Epic, who all are competing for the best developers — but it is increasingly important that content be highly differentiated and costs tightly contained.\nThe Upside of Acquisitions\nThere are a lot of seemingly scary implications in this analysis, including concepts like exclusives, lock-in, and the sense that the big are getting bigger. I think there is a strong argument, though, that the overall impact on consumers is on balance a positive one. Gaming, to a much greater extent than many other industries, is a zero sum game: time spent playing one title is time not spent playing another one. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for any particular gaming platform, relative to the time spent playing games, is a very favorable one. With regards to the latter point, the price of having access to everything is not an overwhelming one; with regards to the former the incentives to make a game that is truly exceptional, and thus truly differentiated, are higher than ever.\nPhil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, made an argument along these lines when I challenged him in a Stratechery interview about a potential loss of competition entailed in the company’s Activision Blizzard acquisition:\n\n  Phil Spencer: Ah. I mean, that’s maybe where we’ll differ in opinion. Some of this just comes down to the teams that become part of our team and our cultural journey with them that starts long ago. This will sound a little bit like a kind of gaming person, but I’ll say the thing that I have found that drives the teams internally to our organization is they want to do things they’ve never been able to do before.

It’s not about one screen that people will consume your game on. You pick the screen that’s right for you. And the input, if you want keyboard or mouse, you want touch, you want controller, you pick.

This has dramatically increased the power of creators, who can not only go direct, but also plays Aggregators off against each other — that is the realm of competition that matters. If we must accept a world where platforms like the App Store have total power within their domains, then the answer is to build up alternative Aggregators that have compelling content of their own, waging a proper fight for the only scarce resource there is on the Internet: time.\nI will save the Wordle acquisition for another day! ↩Each of which has a standalone $10/month plan ↩",

      "content_html": "<p>Intel&#8217;s earnings are not until next Wednesday, but whatever it is that CEO Pat Gelsinger plans to discuss, it seems to me the real news about Intel came from the earnings of another company: TSMC.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tsmc-to-invest-up-to-44-billion-in-2022-to-beef-up-chip-production-11642076019\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chip maker, said it would increase its investment to boost production capacity by up to 47% this year from a year earlier as demand continues to surge amid a global chip crunch. TSMC said Thursday that it has set this year’s capital expenditure budget at $40 billion to $44 billion, a record high, compared with last year’s $30 billion.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tim Culpan at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-13/tsmc-announces-a-budget-of-44-billion-a-warning-sign-to-any-chip-challengers\">Bloomberg</a> described the massive capex figure as a &#8220;warning&#8221; to fellow chipmakers Intel and Samsung:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  From a technology perspective, Samsung is the nearest rival. Yet a comparison is skewed by the fact that the South Korean company also makes display screens and puts most of its semiconductor spending toward commodity memory chips that TSMC doesn’t even bother to make.</p>\n<p>  Then there’s Intel, the U.S. would-be challenger that’s decided to join the foundry fray. In addition to manufacturing chips under its own brand, Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger last year decided he wants to take on TSMC and Samsung — and a handful of others — by offering to make them for external clients.</p>\n<p>  But Intel trails both of them in technology prowess, forcing the California company into the ironic position of relying on TSMC to produce its best chips. Gelsinger is confident that he can catch up. Maybe he will, but there’s no way the firm will be able to expand capacity and economies of scale to the point of being financially competitive.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s worse than that, actually: by becoming TSMC&#8217;s customer Intel is not only denying itself the scale of its own manufacturing needs, but also giving that scale to TSMC, improving the economics of their competitor in the process.</p>\n<h4>Gelsinger&#8217;s Design Tools</h4>\n<p>One of my favorite quotes from Michael Malone&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-intel-trinity-michael-s-malone?variant=32154114457634\">The Intel Trinity</a> is about how &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Law&#8221; — the observation by Intel co-founder and second CEO Gordon Moore that transistor counts for integrated circuits doubled every two years — was not a law, but a choice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  [Moore’s Law] is a social compact, an agreement between the semiconductor industry and the rest of the world that the former will continue to strive to maintain the trajectory of the law as long as possible, and the latter will pay for the fruits of this breakneck pace. Moore’s Law has worked not because it is intrinsic to semiconductor technology. On the contrary, if tomorrow morning the world’s great chip companies were to agree to stop advancing the technology, Moore’s Law would be repealed by tomorrow evening, leaving the next few decades with the task of mopping up all of its implications.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moore made that observation in 1965, and for the next 50 years that choice fell to Intel to make. One of the chief decision-makers was a young man in his 20s named Patrick Gelsinger. Gelsinger joined Intel straight out of high school, and worked on the team developing the 286 processor while studying electrical engineering at Stanford; he was the 4th lead for the 386 while completing his Masters. After he graduated Gelsinger became the lead of the 486 project; he was only 25.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8328\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8328\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/intel-1.png?resize=640%2C422&#038;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8328\" width=\"640\" height=\"422\" alt=\"The Intel 486 die\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/intel-1.png?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/intel-1.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/intel-1.png?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/intel-1.png?resize=955%2C630&amp;ssl=1 955w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/intel-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Intel 486 die</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Intel was, at this time, a fully integrated device manufacturer (IDM); while that term today refers to a company that designs and fabricates its own chips (in contrast to a company like Nvidia, which designs its own chips but doesn&#8217;t manufacture them, or TSMC, which manufactures chips but doesn&#8217;t design them), the level of integration has decreased over time as other companies have come to specialize in different parts of the manufacturing process. Back in the 1980s, though, Intel still had to figure out a lot of things for the first time, including how to actually design ever more microscopic chips. Gelsinger, along with three co-authors, described the problem in a 2012 paper entitled <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268005718_Coping_with_the_Complexity_of_Microprocessor_Design_at_Intel_-_A_CAD_History\">Coping with the Complexity of Microprocessor Design at Intel — a CAD History</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In his original 1965 paper, Gordon Moore expressed a concern that the growth rate he predicted may not be sustainable, because the requirement to define and design products at such a rapidly-growing complexity may not keep up with his predicted growth rate. However, the highly competitive business environment drove to fully exploit technology scaling. The number of available transistors doubled with every generation of process technology, which occurred roughly every two years. As shown in Table I, major architecture changes in microprocessors were occurring with a 4X increase of transistor count, approximately every second process generation. Intel&#8217;s microprocessor design teams had to come up with ways to keep pace with the size and scope of every new project.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Processor</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Intro Date</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Process</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Transistors</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Frequency</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>4004</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1971</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2,300</td>\n<td align=\"center\">108 KHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8080</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1974</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8086</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1978</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">29,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80286</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1982</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.5 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">134,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80386</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1985</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.5 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">275,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">16 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intel486 DX</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1989</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.2 M</td>\n<td align=\"center\">33 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pentium</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1993</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0.8 um</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.1 M</td>\n<td align=\"center\">60 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>  This incredible growth rate could not be achieved by hiring an exponentially-growing number of design engineers. It was fulfilled by adopting new design methodologies and by introducing innovative design automation software at every processor generation. These methodologies and tools always applied principles of raising design abstraction, becoming increasingly precise in terms of circuit and parasitic modeling while simultaneously using ever-increasing levels of hierarchy, regularity, and automatic synthesis. As a rule, whenever a task became too painful to perform using the old methods, a new method and associated tool were conceived for solving the problem. This way, tools and design practices were evolving, always addressing the most labor-intensive task at hand. Naturally, the evolution of tools occurred bottom-up, from layout tools to circuit, logic, and architecture. Typically, at each abstraction level the verification problem was most painful, hence it was addressed first. The synthesis problem at that level was addressed much later.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This feedback loop between design and implementation is exactly what is necessary at the cutting edge of innovation. Clayton Christensen explained in <a href=\"https://claytonchristensen.com/books/the-innovators-solution/\">The Innovator&#8217;s Solution</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When there is a performance gap — when product functionality and reliability are not yet good enough to address the needs of customers in a given tier of the market — companies must compete by making the best possible products. In the race to do this, firms that build their products around proprietary, interdependent architectures enjoy an important competitive advantage against competitors whose product architectures are modular, because the standardization inherent in modularity takes too many degrees of design freedom away from engineers, and they cannot not optimize performance.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is what Gelsinger did with the 486; from the afore-linked paper:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  While the 386 design heavily leveraged the logic design of the 286, the 486 was a more radical departure with the move to a fully pipelined design, the integration of a large floating point unit, and the introduction of the first on-chip cache – a whopping 8K byte cache which was a write through cache used for both code and data. Given that substantially less of the design was leveraged from prior designs and with the 4X increase in transistor counts, there was enormous pressure for yet another leap in design productivity. While we could have pursued simple increases in manpower, there were questions of the ability to afford them, find them, train them and then effectively manage a team that would have needed to be much greater than 100 people that eventually made up the 486 design team…For executing this visionary design flow, we needed to put together a CAD system which did not exist yet.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>To make a new chip, Intel needed to make new tools, as part of an overall integrated effort that ran from design to manufacturing.</p>\n<h4>Intel&#8217;s Ossification</h4>\n<p>Fast forward three decades and Intel is no longer on the cutting edge; instead the leading chip manufacturer in the world is TSMC, a company <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/intel-and-the-danger-of-integration/\">built on the idea that it does not do design</a>; Morris Chang told the <a href=\"https://www.semi.org/en/Oral-History-Interview-Morris-Chang\">Computer History Museum</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When I was at TI and General Instrument, I saw a lot of IC [Integrated Circuit] designers wanting to leave and set up their own business, but the only thing, or the biggest thing that stopped them from leaving those companies was that they couldn’t raise enough money to form their own company. Because at that time, it was thought that every company needed manufacturing, needed wafer manufacturing, and that was the most capital intensive part of a semiconductor company, of an IC company. And I saw all those people wanting to leave, but being stopped by the lack of ability to raise a lot of money to build a wafer fab. So I thought that maybe TSMC, a pure-play foundry, could remedy that. And as a result of us being able to remedy that then those designers would successfully form their own companies, and they will become our customers, and they will constitute a stable and growing market for us.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was skating to Christensen&#8217;s puck; again from <em>The Innovator&#8217;s Solution</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Overshooting does not mean that customers will no longer pay for improvements. It just means that the type of improvement for which they will pay a premium price will change. Once their requirements for functionality and reliability have been met, customers begin to redefine define what is not good enough. What becomes not good enough is that customers can&#8217;t get exactly what they want exactly when they need it, as conveniently as possible. Customers become willing to pay premium prices for improved performance along this new trajectory of innovation in speed, convenience, and customization. When this happens, we say that the basis of competition in a tier of the market has changed.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>TSMC was willing to build any chip that these new fabless companies could come up with; what is notable is that it was Gelsinger and Intel who made this modular approach possible, thanks to the tools they built for the 486. Again from that paper:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The combination of all these tools was stitched together into a system called RLS<sup id=\"rf1-8327\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/#fn1-8327\" title=\"RTL to Layout Synthesis\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> which was the first RTL<sup id=\"rf2-8327\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/#fn2-8327\" title=\"Register-Transfer Level\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> to layout system ever employed in a major microprocessor development program…RLS succeeded because it combined the power of three essential ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CMOS (which enabled the use of a cell library)</li>\n<li>A Hardware Description Language (providing a convenient input mechanism to capture design intent)</li>\n<li>Synthesis (which provided the automatic conversion from RTL to gates and layout)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  This was the &#8220;magic and powerful triumvirate&#8221;. Each one of these elements alone could not revolutionize design productivity. A combination of all three was necessary! These three elements were later standardized and integrated by the EDA<sup id=\"rf3-8327\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/#fn3-8327\" title=\"Electronic Design Automation\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> industry. This kind of system became the basis for all of the ASIC<sup id=\"rf4-8327\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/#fn4-8327\" title=\"Application-specific Integrated Circuit\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> industry, and the common interface for the fabless semiconductor industry.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problem is that Intel, used to inventing its own tools and processes, gradually fell behind the curve on standardization; yes, the company had partnerships with EDA companies like Synopsys and Cadence, but most of the company&#8217;s work was done on its own homegrown tools, tuned to its own fabs. This made it very difficult to be an Intel Custom Foundry customer; worse, Intel itself was wasting time building tools that once were differentiators, but now were commodities.</p>\n<p>This bit about tools isn&#8217;t new; Gelsinger announced Intel&#8217;s support for Synopsis and Cadence at <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-unleashed-gelsinger-on-intel-idm-2-0/\">last March&#8217;s announcement of Intel Foundry Services (IFS)</a>, and of course they did: Intel can&#8217;t expect to be a full-service foundry if it can&#8217;t use industry-standard design tools and IP libraries.</p>\n<p>What I have come to appreciate, though, is exactly why Gelsinger announced IFS as only one part of Intel&#8217;s broader &#8220;IDM 2.0&#8221; strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part 1 was Intel&#8217;s internal manufacturing of its own designs; this was basically IDM 1.0.</li>\n<li>Part 2 was Intel&#8217;s plan to use 3rd-party manufacturers like TSMC for its cutting edge products.</li>\n<li>Part 3 was Intel Foundry Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I had been calling for something like IFS since <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/the-intel-opportunity/\">the beginning of Stratechery</a>, and had even gone so far as to <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-problems/\">advocate a split of the company</a> a month before Gelsinger&#8217;s presentation. &#8220;IDM 2.0&#8221; suggested that Intel wasn&#8217;t going to go quite that far — and understandably so, given the history of Part 1 — but the more I think about Part 2, and how it connects to the other pieces, I wonder if I was closer to the mark than I realized.</p>\n<h4>Microsoft and Intel</h4>\n<p>In 2018, when I traced the remarkable turnaround Satya Nadella had led at Microsoft in an article entitled <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/\">The End of Windows</a>, I noted that Nadella&#8217;s first public event was to announce Office on iPad. This was an effort that was launched years previously under former CEO Steve Ballmer, but hadn&#8217;t launched because the Windows Touch version wasn&#8217;t ready. That, though, was precisely why Nadella&#8217;s launch was meaningful: he was signaling to the rest of the company that Windows would no longer be the imperative for Office; that same week Nadella renamed Windows Azure to Microsoft Azure, sending the exact same message.</p>\n<p>I thought of this timing when Gelsinger spoke about TSMC making chips for Intel; that too was an initiative launched under a predecessor (Bob Swan). The assumption made by nearly everyone, though, was that Intel&#8217;s partnership with TSMC would only be a stopgap while the company got its manufacturing house in order, such that it could compete directly; indeed, that is the assumption underlying the opening of this Article.</p>\n<p>This, though, is why TSMC&#8217;s announcement about its increased capital expenditure was such a big deal: a major driver of that increase appears to be Intel, for whom TSMC is reportedly building a custom fab. From <a href=\"https://digitimes.com/news/a20220113PD204.html\">DigiTimes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  TSMC plans to have its new production site in the Baoshan area in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan make 3nm chips for Intel, according to industry sources. TSMC will have part of the site converted to 3nm process manufacturing, the sources said. The facilities of the site, dubbed P8 and P9, were originally designed for an R&amp;D center for sub-3nm process technologies. The P8 and P9 of TSMC&#8217;s Baoshan site will be capable of each processing 20,000 wafers monthly, and will be dedicated to fulfilling Intel&#8217;s orders, the sources indicated.</p>\n<p>  TSMC intends to differentiate its chip production for Intel from that for Apple, and has therefore decided to separate its 3nm process fabrication lines dedicated to fulfilling orders from these two major clients, the sources noted. The moves are also to protect the customers&#8217; respective confidential products, the sources said. Intel&#8217;s demand could be huge enough to persuade TSMC to modify the pure-play foundry&#8217;s manufacturing blueprints, the sources indicated. The pair&#8217;s partnership is also likely to be a long-term one, the sources said.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Intel and Microsoft are bound by history, of course, but obviously their businesses are at the opposite ends of the computing spectrum: Intel deals in atoms and Microsoft in bits. What was common to both, though, was an unshakeable belief in the foundations of their business model: for Microsoft, it was the leverage over not just the desktop, but also productivity and enterprise servers, delivered by Windows; for Intel it was the <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/intel-and-the-danger-of-integration/\">superiority of their manufacturing</a>. Nadella, before he could change tactics or even strategy, had to <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/microsofts-monopoly-hangover/\">shake the Windows hangover that had corrupted the culture</a>; Gelsinger needed to do the same to Intel, which meant taking on his own factories.</p>\n<p>Think about the EAD issue I explained above: it must have been a slog to cajole Intel&#8217;s engineers into abandoning their homegrown solutions in favor of industry standards when the only beneficiaries were potential foundry customers — that is one of the big reasons why Intel Custom Foundry failed previously. However, if Intel were to manufacture its chips with TSMC, then it would have no choice but to use industry standards. Moreover, just as Windows needed to learn to compete on its own merits, instead of expecting Office or Azure to prop it up, Intel&#8217;s factories, denied monopoly access to cutting edge x86 chips, will now have to compete with TSMC to earn not just 3rd-party business, but business from Intel&#8217;s own design team.</p>\n<h4>The Intel Split</h4>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-problems/\">I wrote that Intel should be broken up</a> I focused on incentives:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This is why Intel needs to be split in two. Yes, integrating design and manufacturing was the foundation of Intel’s moat for decades, but that integration has become a strait-jacket for both sides of the business. Intel’s designs are held back by the company’s struggles in manufacturing, while its manufacturing has an incentive problem.</p>\n<p>  The key thing to understand about chips is that design has much higher margins; Nvidia, for example, has gross margins between 60~65%, while TSMC, which makes Nvidia’s chips, has gross margins closer to 50%. Intel has, as I noted above, traditionally had margins closer to Nvidia, thanks to its integration, which is why Intel’s own chips will always be a priority for its manufacturing arm. That will mean worse service for prospective customers, and less willingness to change its manufacturing approach to both accommodate customers and incorporate best-of-breed suppliers (lowering margins even further). There is also the matter of trust: would companies that compete with Intel be willing to share their designs with their competitor, particularly if that competitor is incentivized to prioritize its own business?</p>\n<p>  The only way to fix this incentive problem is to spin off Intel’s manufacturing business. Yes, it will take time to build out the customer service components necessary to work with third parties, not to mention the huge library of IP building blocks that make working with a company like TSMC (relatively) easy. But a standalone manufacturing business will have the most powerful incentive possible to make this transformation happen: the need to survive.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Intel is obviously not splitting up, but this TSMC investment sure makes it seem like Gelsinger recognizes the straitjacket Intel was in, and is doing everything possible to get out of it. To that end, it seems increasingly clear that the goal is to de-integrate Intel: Intel the design company is basically going fabless, giving its business to the best foundry in the world, whether or not that foundry is Intel; Intel the manufacturing company, meanwhile, has to earn its way (with exclusive access to x86 IP blocks as a carrot for hyperscalers building their own chips), including with Intel&#8217;s own CPUs.</p>\n<h4>Gelsinger&#8217;s Grovian Moment</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear that this will work, of course; indeed, it is incredibly risky, given just how expensive fabs are to build, and how critical it is that they operate at full capacity. Moreover, Intel is making TSMC stronger (while TSMC benefits from having <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-great-bifurcation-follow-up-more-on-intel-and-tsmc-intel-to-spin-out-mobileye/\">another tentpole customer to compete with Apple</a>). Given Intel&#8217;s performance over the last decade, though, it might have been more risky to stick with the status quo, in which Intel&#8217;s floundering fabs take down Intel&#8217;s design as well. In that regard it makes sense; in fact, one is reminded of the famous story of Moore and Gelsinger&#8217;s mentor, Andy Grove, deciding to get out of memory, which I wrote about <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/andy-grove-and-the-iphone-se/\">in 2016</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Intel was founded as a memory company, and the company made its name by pioneering metal-oxide semiconductor technology in first SRAM and then in the first commercially available DRAM. It was memory that drove all of Intel’s initial revenue and profits, and the best employees and best manufacturing facilities were devoted to memory in adherence to Intel’s belief that memory was their “technology driver”, the product that made everything else — including their fledgling microprocessors — possible.

      "content_text": "Intel’s earnings are not until next Wednesday, but whatever it is that CEO Pat Gelsinger plans to discuss, it seems to me the real news about Intel came from the earnings of another company: TSMC.\nFrom the Wall Street Journal:\n\n  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chip maker, said it would increase its investment to boost production capacity by up to 47% this year from a year earlier as demand continues to surge amid a global chip crunch. TSMC said Thursday that it has set this year’s capital expenditure budget at $40 billion to $44 billion, a record high, compared with last year’s $30 billion.\n\nTim Culpan at Bloomberg described the massive capex figure as a “warning” to fellow chipmakers Intel and Samsung:\n\n  From a technology perspective, Samsung is the nearest rival. Yet a comparison is skewed by the fact that the South Korean company also makes display screens and puts most of its semiconductor spending toward commodity memory chips that TSMC doesn’t even bother to make.\n  Then there’s Intel, the U.S. would-be challenger that’s decided to join the foundry fray. In addition to manufacturing chips under its own brand, Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger last year decided he wants to take on TSMC and Samsung — and a handful of others — by offering to make them for external clients.\n  But Intel trails both of them in technology prowess, forcing the California company into the ironic position of relying on TSMC to produce its best chips. Gelsinger is confident that he can catch up. Maybe he will, but there’s no way the firm will be able to expand capacity and economies of scale to the point of being financially competitive.\n\nIt’s worse than that, actually: by becoming TSMC’s customer Intel is not only denying itself the scale of its own manufacturing needs, but also giving that scale to TSMC, improving the economics of their competitor in the process.\nGelsinger’s Design Tools\nOne of my favorite quotes from Michael Malone’s The Intel Trinity is about how “Moore’s Law” — the observation by Intel co-founder and second CEO Gordon Moore that transistor counts for integrated circuits doubled every two years — was not a law, but a choice:\n\n  [Moore’s Law] is a social compact, an agreement between the semiconductor industry and the rest of the world that the former will continue to strive to maintain the trajectory of the law as long as possible, and the latter will pay for the fruits of this breakneck pace. Moore’s Law has worked not because it is intrinsic to semiconductor technology. On the contrary, if tomorrow morning the world’s great chip companies were to agree to stop advancing the technology, Moore’s Law would be repealed by tomorrow evening, leaving the next few decades with the task of mopping up all of its implications.\n\nMoore made that observation in 1965, and for the next 50 years that choice fell to Intel to make. One of the chief decision-makers was a young man in his 20s named Patrick Gelsinger. Gelsinger joined Intel straight out of high school, and worked on the team developing the 286 processor while studying electrical engineering at Stanford; he was the 4th lead for the 386 while completing his Masters. After he graduated Gelsinger became the lead of the 486 project; he was only 25.\nThe Intel 486 die\nIntel was, at this time, a fully integrated device manufacturer (IDM); while that term today refers to a company that designs and fabricates its own chips (in contrast to a company like Nvidia, which designs its own chips but doesn’t manufacture them, or TSMC, which manufactures chips but doesn’t design them), the level of integration has decreased over time as other companies have come to specialize in different parts of the manufacturing process. Back in the 1980s, though, Intel still had to figure out a lot of things for the first time, including how to actually design ever more microscopic chips. Gelsinger, along with three co-authors, described the problem in a 2012 paper entitled Coping with the Complexity of Microprocessor Design at Intel — a CAD History:\n\n  In his original 1965 paper, Gordon Moore expressed a concern that the growth rate he predicted may not be sustainable, because the requirement to define and design products at such a rapidly-growing complexity may not keep up with his predicted growth rate. However, the highly competitive business environment drove to fully exploit technology scaling. The number of available transistors doubled with every generation of process technology, which occurred roughly every two years. As shown in Table I, major architecture changes in microprocessors were occurring with a 4X increase of transistor count, approximately every second process generation. Intel’s microprocessor design teams had to come up with ways to keep pace with the size and scope of every new project.\n\n\n\nProcessor\nIntro Date\nProcess\nTransistors\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n4004\n1971\n10 um\n2,300\n108 KHz\n\n\n8080\n1974\n6 um\n6,000\n2 MHz\n\n\n8086\n1978\n3 um\n29,000\n10 MHz\n\n\n80286\n1982\n1.5 um\n134,000\n12 MHz\n\n\n80386\n1985\n1.5 um\n275,000\n16 MHz\n\n\nIntel486 DX\n1989\n1 um\n1.2 M\n33 MHz\n\n\nPentium\n1993\n0.8 um\n3.1 M\n60 MHz\n\n\n\n  This incredible growth rate could not be achieved by hiring an exponentially-growing number of design engineers. It was fulfilled by adopting new design methodologies and by introducing innovative design automation software at every processor generation. These methodologies and tools always applied principles of raising design abstraction, becoming increasingly precise in terms of circuit and parasitic modeling while simultaneously using ever-increasing levels of hierarchy, regularity, and automatic synthesis. As a rule, whenever a task became too painful to perform using the old methods, a new method and associated tool were conceived for solving the problem. This way, tools and design practices were evolving, always addressing the most labor-intensive task at hand. Naturally, the evolution of tools occurred bottom-up, from layout tools to circuit, logic, and architecture. Typically, at each abstraction level the verification problem was most painful, hence it was addressed first. The synthesis problem at that level was addressed much later.\n\nThis feedback loop between design and implementation is exactly what is necessary at the cutting edge of innovation. Clayton Christensen explained in The Innovator’s Solution:\n\n  When there is a performance gap — when product functionality and reliability are not yet good enough to address the needs of customers in a given tier of the market — companies must compete by making the best possible products. In the race to do this, firms that build their products around proprietary, interdependent architectures enjoy an important competitive advantage against competitors whose product architectures are modular, because the standardization inherent in modularity takes too many degrees of design freedom away from engineers, and they cannot not optimize performance.\n\nThis is what Gelsinger did with the 486; from the afore-linked paper:\n\n  While the 386 design heavily leveraged the logic design of the 286, the 486 was a more radical departure with the move to a fully pipelined design, the integration of a large floating point unit, and the introduction of the first on-chip cache – a whopping 8K byte cache which was a write through cache used for both code and data. Given that substantially less of the design was leveraged from prior designs and with the 4X increase in transistor counts, there was enormous pressure for yet another leap in design productivity. While we could have pursued simple increases in manpower, there were questions of the ability to afford them, find them, train them and then effectively manage a team that would have needed to be much greater than 100 people that eventually made up the 486 design team…For executing this visionary design flow, we needed to put together a CAD system which did not exist yet.\n\nTo make a new chip, Intel needed to make new tools, as part of an overall integrated effort that ran from design to manufacturing.\nIntel’s Ossification\nFast forward three decades and Intel is no longer on the cutting edge; instead the leading chip manufacturer in the world is TSMC, a company built on the idea that it does not do design; Morris Chang told the Computer History Museum:\n\n  When I was at TI and General Instrument, I saw a lot of IC [Integrated Circuit] designers wanting to leave and set up their own business, but the only thing, or the biggest thing that stopped them from leaving those companies was that they couldn’t raise enough money to form their own company. Because at that time, it was thought that every company needed manufacturing, needed wafer manufacturing, and that was the most capital intensive part of a semiconductor company, of an IC company. And I saw all those people wanting to leave, but being stopped by the lack of ability to raise a lot of money to build a wafer fab. So I thought that maybe TSMC, a pure-play foundry, could remedy that. And as a result of us being able to remedy that then those designers would successfully form their own companies, and they will become our customers, and they will constitute a stable and growing market for us.\n\nThis was skating to Christensen’s puck; again from The Innovator’s Solution:\n\n  Overshooting does not mean that customers will no longer pay for improvements. It just means that the type of improvement for which they will pay a premium price will change. Once their requirements for functionality and reliability have been met, customers begin to redefine define what is not good enough. What becomes not good enough is that customers can’t get exactly what they want exactly when they need it, as conveniently as possible. Customers become willing to pay premium prices for improved performance along this new trajectory of innovation in speed, convenience, and customization. When this happens, we say that the basis of competition in a tier of the market has changed.\n\nTSMC was willing to build any chip that these new fabless companies could come up with; what is notable is that it was Gelsinger and Intel who made this modular approach possible, thanks to the tools they built for the 486. Again from that paper:\n\n  The combination of all these tools was stitched together into a system called RLS1 which was the first RTL2 to layout system ever employed in a major microprocessor development program…RLS succeeded because it combined the power of three essential ingredients:\n\nCMOS (which enabled the use of a cell library)\nA Hardware Description Language (providing a convenient input mechanism to capture design intent)\nSynthesis (which provided the automatic conversion from RTL to gates and layout)\n\n  This was the “magic and powerful triumvirate”. Each one of these elements alone could not revolutionize design productivity. A combination of all three was necessary! These three elements were later standardized and integrated by the EDA3 industry. This kind of system became the basis for all of the ASIC4 industry, and the common interface for the fabless semiconductor industry.\n\nThe problem is that Intel, used to inventing its own tools and processes, gradually fell behind the curve on standardization; yes, the company had partnerships with EDA companies like Synopsys and Cadence, but most of the company’s work was done on its own homegrown tools, tuned to its own fabs. This made it very difficult to be an Intel Custom Foundry customer; worse, Intel itself was wasting time building tools that once were differentiators, but now were commodities.\nThis bit about tools isn’t new; Gelsinger announced Intel’s support for Synopsis and Cadence at last March’s announcement of Intel Foundry Services (IFS), and of course they did: Intel can’t expect to be a full-service foundry if it can’t use industry-standard design tools and IP libraries.\nWhat I have come to appreciate, though, is exactly why Gelsinger announced IFS as only one part of Intel’s broader “IDM 2.0” strategy:\n\nPart 1 was Intel’s internal manufacturing of its own designs; this was basically IDM 1.0.\nPart 2 was Intel’s plan to use 3rd-party manufacturers like TSMC for its cutting edge products.\nPart 3 was Intel Foundry Services.\n\nI had been calling for something like IFS since the beginning of Stratechery, and had even gone so far as to advocate a split of the company a month before Gelsinger’s presentation. “IDM 2.0” suggested that Intel wasn’t going to go quite that far — and understandably so, given the history of Part 1 — but the more I think about Part 2, and how it connects to the other pieces, I wonder if I was closer to the mark than I realized.\nMicrosoft and Intel\nIn 2018, when I traced the remarkable turnaround Satya Nadella had led at Microsoft in an article entitled The End of Windows, I noted that Nadella’s first public event was to announce Office on iPad. This was an effort that was launched years previously under former CEO Steve Ballmer, but hadn’t launched because the Windows Touch version wasn’t ready. That, though, was precisely why Nadella’s launch was meaningful: he was signaling to the rest of the company that Windows would no longer be the imperative for Office; that same week Nadella renamed Windows Azure to Microsoft Azure, sending the exact same message.\nI thought of this timing when Gelsinger spoke about TSMC making chips for Intel; that too was an initiative launched under a predecessor (Bob Swan). The assumption made by nearly everyone, though, was that Intel’s partnership with TSMC would only be a stopgap while the company got its manufacturing house in order, such that it could compete directly; indeed, that is the assumption underlying the opening of this Article.\nThis, though, is why TSMC’s announcement about its increased capital expenditure was such a big deal: a major driver of that increase appears to be Intel, for whom TSMC is reportedly building a custom fab. From DigiTimes:\n\n  TSMC plans to have its new production site in the Baoshan area in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan make 3nm chips for Intel, according to industry sources. TSMC will have part of the site converted to 3nm process manufacturing, the sources said. The facilities of the site, dubbed P8 and P9, were originally designed for an R&D center for sub-3nm process technologies. The P8 and P9 of TSMC’s Baoshan site will be capable of each processing 20,000 wafers monthly, and will be dedicated to fulfilling Intel’s orders, the sources indicated.\n  TSMC intends to differentiate its chip production for Intel from that for Apple, and has therefore decided to separate its 3nm process fabrication lines dedicated to fulfilling orders from these two major clients, the sources noted. The moves are also to protect the customers’ respective confidential products, the sources said. Intel’s demand could be huge enough to persuade TSMC to modify the pure-play foundry’s manufacturing blueprints, the sources indicated. The pair’s partnership is also likely to be a long-term one, the sources said.\n\nIntel and Microsoft are bound by history, of course, but obviously their businesses are at the opposite ends of the computing spectrum: Intel deals in atoms and Microsoft in bits. What was common to both, though, was an unshakeable belief in the foundations of their business model: for Microsoft, it was the leverage over not just the desktop, but also productivity and enterprise servers, delivered by Windows; for Intel it was the superiority of their manufacturing. Nadella, before he could change tactics or even strategy, had to shake the Windows hangover that had corrupted the culture; Gelsinger needed to do the same to Intel, which meant taking on his own factories.\nThink about the EAD issue I explained above: it must have been a slog to cajole Intel’s engineers into abandoning their homegrown solutions in favor of industry standards when the only beneficiaries were potential foundry customers — that is one of the big reasons why Intel Custom Foundry failed previously. However, if Intel were to manufacture its chips with TSMC, then it would have no choice but to use industry standards. Moreover, just as Windows needed to learn to compete on its own merits, instead of expecting Office or Azure to prop it up, Intel’s factories, denied monopoly access to cutting edge x86 chips, will now have to compete with TSMC to earn not just 3rd-party business, but business from Intel’s own design team.\nThe Intel Split\nWhen I wrote that Intel should be broken up I focused on incentives:\n\n  This is why Intel needs to be split in two. Yes, integrating design and manufacturing was the foundation of Intel’s moat for decades, but that integration has become a strait-jacket for both sides of the business. Intel’s designs are held back by the company’s struggles in manufacturing, while its manufacturing has an incentive problem.\n  The key thing to understand about chips is that design has much higher margins; Nvidia, for example, has gross margins between 60~65%, while TSMC, which makes Nvidia’s chips, has gross margins closer to 50%. Intel has, as I noted above, traditionally had margins closer to Nvidia, thanks to its integration, which is why Intel’s own chips will always be a priority for its manufacturing arm. That will mean worse service for prospective customers, and less willingness to change its manufacturing approach to both accommodate customers and incorporate best-of-breed suppliers (lowering margins even further). There is also the matter of trust: would companies that compete with Intel be willing to share their designs with their competitor, particularly if that competitor is incentivized to prioritize its own business?\n  The only way to fix this incentive problem is to spin off Intel’s manufacturing business. Yes, it will take time to build out the customer service components necessary to work with third parties, not to mention the huge library of IP building blocks that make working with a company like TSMC (relatively) easy. But a standalone manufacturing business will have the most powerful incentive possible to make this transformation happen: the need to survive.\n\nIntel is obviously not splitting up, but this TSMC investment sure makes it seem like Gelsinger recognizes the straitjacket Intel was in, and is doing everything possible to get out of it. To that end, it seems increasingly clear that the goal is to de-integrate Intel: Intel the design company is basically going fabless, giving its business to the best foundry in the world, whether or not that foundry is Intel; Intel the manufacturing company, meanwhile, has to earn its way (with exclusive access to x86 IP blocks as a carrot for hyperscalers building their own chips), including with Intel’s own CPUs.\nGelsinger’s Grovian Moment\nIt’s not clear that this will work, of course; indeed, it is incredibly risky, given just how expensive fabs are to build, and how critical it is that they operate at full capacity. Moreover, Intel is making TSMC stronger (while TSMC benefits from having another tentpole customer to compete with Apple). Given Intel’s performance over the last decade, though, it might have been more risky to stick with the status quo, in which Intel’s floundering fabs take down Intel’s design as well. In that regard it makes sense; in fact, one is reminded of the famous story of Moore and Gelsinger’s mentor, Andy Grove, deciding to get out of memory, which I wrote about in 2016:\n\n  Intel was founded as a memory company, and the company made its name by pioneering metal-oxide semiconductor technology in first SRAM and then in the first commercially available DRAM. It was memory that drove all of Intel’s initial revenue and profits, and the best employees and best manufacturing facilities were devoted to memory in adherence to Intel’s belief that memory was their “technology driver”, the product that made everything else — including their fledgling microprocessors — possible. As Grove wrote in Only the Paranoid Survive, “Our priorities were formed by our identity; after all, memories were us.”\n  The problem is that by the mid-1980s Japanese competitors were producing more reliable memory at lower costs (allegedly) backed by unlimited funding from the Japanese government, and Intel was struggling to compete…\n\nGrove explained what happened next in Only the Paranoid Survive:\n\n  I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel’s chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris Wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, “If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?” Gordon answered without hesitation, “He would get us out of memories.” I stared at him, numb, then said, “Why don’t you and I walk out the door, come back in and do it ourselves?”\n\nGelsinger was once thought to be next-in-line to be Intel’s CEO; he literally walked out the door in 2009 and for a decade Intel floundered under business types who couldn’t have dreamed of building the 486 or the tools that made it possible; now he has come back home, and is doing what must be done if Intel is to be both a great design company and a great manufacturing company: split them up.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.\nRTL to Layout Synthesis ↩Register-Transfer Level ↩Electronic Design Automation ↩Application-specific Integrated Circuit ↩",

      "content_html": "<p><em>This was originally sent as a subscriber-only Update.</em></p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-opensea-eyes-13-billion-valuation\">Eric Newcomer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The NFT-marketplace OpenSea is in talks to raise at a $13 billion valuation in a deal led by Coatue, sources tell me. Paradigm will also co-lead the $300 million funding round, according to a spokesperson for the firm. Kathryn Haun’s new crypto fund, which is currently operating under Haun’s initials “KRH,” is also participating in the funding round, sources tell me. Dan Rose at Coatue is spearheading the round and may take a board observer seat.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>OpenSea confirmed the news on their <a href=\"https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/announcing-openseas-new-funding/\">blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In 2021, we saw the world awaken to the idea that NFTs represent the basic building blocks for brand new peer-to-peer economies. They give users greater freedom and ownership over digital goods, and allow developers to build powerful, interoperable applications that provide real economic value and utility to users. OpenSea’s vision is to become the core destination for these new open digital economies to thrive, building the world’s friendliest and most trusted NFT marketplace with the best selection.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is, of course, a story about NFTs, at least in part, and by extension, a story about the so-called Web 3 née crypto economy that its fiercest advocates say is the future. But there are two other parts of this story that are very much at home on the Internet as it exists in the present: $13 billion, and &#8220;core destination.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>OpenSea&#8217;s Value</h4>\n<p>First, two more OpenSea stories from over the break. From <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/2-2-million-bored-ape-nfts-stolen-opensea-freezes-transactions/\">Be In Crypto</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  NFT marketplace OpenSea has frozen $2.2 million worth of Bored Ape (BAYC) NFTs after they were reported as being stolen. The NFTs on the marketplace now have a warning saying that it is “reported for suspicious activity.” Buying and selling of such items are suspended…</p>\n<p>  Meanwhile, there is a bit of a squabble happening over OpenSea over the Phunky Ape Yacht Club (PAYC). The NFT platform banned this NFT series because it was based on the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. PAYC is virtually identical to BAYC, except for the fact it is mirrored.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This excerpt isn&#8217;t technically complete: buying and selling of the stolen NFTs — or of the PAYC NFTs — are suspended <em>on OpenSea</em>. The fact of the matter is that (references to) NFTs are, famously, stored on the blockchain (Ethereum in this case), and once those BAYC NFTs were transferred, by consent of their previous owner or not, the transaction cannot be undone without the consent of their new owner; said owner can buy or sell the NFTs to someone else, but not on OpenSea. It&#8217;s the same thing with with the BAYC rip-offs: they exist on the blockchain, whether or not OpenSea lists them for sale or not.</p>\n<p>This, according to crypto advocates, is evidence of the allure of Web 3: because the blockchain is open and accessible by anyone, the stolen BAYC NFTs and the PAYC rip-offs can be sold on another market, or if one cannot be found, in a private transaction (leave aside, for the sake of argument and the brevity of this update, the question as to whether the fact that these transactions are irreversible is a feature or a bug).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though: this isn&#8217;t a new concept. What is the first answer given to anyone who is banned from Twitter, or demonetized on YouTube — two of the go-to examples Web 3 advocates give about the problem of centralized power on the Internet today? Start your own Twitter, or start your own blog, or set up a Substack. These answers are frustrating because they are true: the web is open.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if this frustration sounds familiar, it is because it is the frustration of the regulator insisting that Aggregators are monopolies, that Google is somehow forcing users to not use Bing like some sort of railroad baron extorting farmers simply seeking to move grain to market, or that Facebook has a monopoly on social networking, ignoring the fact that we have far more ways to communicate than ever before.</p>\n<p>In fact, what gives Aggregators their power is not their control of supply: they are not the only way to find websites, or to post your opinions online; rather, it is their control of demand. People are used to Google, or it is the default, so sites and advertisers don&#8217;t want to spend their time and money on alternatives; people want other people to see what they have to say, so they don&#8217;t want to risk writing a blog that no one reads, or spending time on a social network that because it lacks the network has no sense of social.</p>\n<p>This is why regulations focused on undoing the control of supply are ineffective: the marginal cost nature of computing and the zero distribution cost of the Internet made it viable for the first time — and far more profitable — to control demand, not by forcing people to act against their will, but by making it easy for them to accomplish whatever it is they wished to do, whether that be find a website, buy a good, talk to their friends, or give their opinion. And now, to buy or sell NFTs.</p>\n<p>This, then, is the reason that OpenSea received its $13 billion valuation: it is by far the dominant market for NFTs; should the market exist in the long run, the most likely entryway for end users will be OpenSea. This is a very profitable position to be in, even if alternatives are only a click away. It&#8217;s not like that reduces the profitability of a Google or a Facebook.</p>\n<p>It is also why OpenSea&#8217;s bans have some amount of teeth to them: as I noted, you can still buy and sell these stolen and rip-off NFTs, just as you can still go to a website that is not listed in Google, communicate with a friend kicked off of Facebook, or state your opinions somewhere other than Twitter. The reduced demand, though, lowers the price, whether that price be traffic, convenience, or attention. Or, in the case of NFTs, ETH: not having access to OpenSea means there is less demand for these NFTs, and less demand means lower prices.</p>\n<p>In short, OpenSea has power not because it controls the NFTs in question, but because it controls the vast majority of demand.</p>\n<h4>Crypto&#8217;s Aggregators</h4>\n<p>One of the reasons that crypto is so interesting, at least in a theoretical sense, is that it seems like a natural antidote to Aggregators; <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/tulips-myths-and-cryptocurrencies/\">I&#8217;ve suggested as such</a>. After all, Aggregators are a product of abundance; scarcity is the opposite. The OpenSea example, though, is a reminder that I have forgotten one of my own arguments about Aggregators: demand matters more than supply.</p>\n<p>To that end, which side of the equation is impacted by the blockchain? The answer, quite obviously is supply. Indeed, one need only be tangentially aware of crypto to realize that the primary goal of so many advocates is to convert non-believers, the better to increase demand.

      "content_text": "This was originally sent as a subscriber-only Update.\nFrom Eric Newcomer:\n\n  The NFT-marketplace OpenSea is in talks to raise at a $13 billion valuation in a deal led by Coatue, sources tell me. Paradigm will also co-lead the $300 million funding round, according to a spokesperson for the firm. Kathryn Haun’s new crypto fund, which is currently operating under Haun’s initials “KRH,” is also participating in the funding round, sources tell me. Dan Rose at Coatue is spearheading the round and may take a board observer seat.\n\nOpenSea confirmed the news on their blog:\n\n  In 2021, we saw the world awaken to the idea that NFTs represent the basic building blocks for brand new peer-to-peer economies. They give users greater freedom and ownership over digital goods, and allow developers to build powerful, interoperable applications that provide real economic value and utility to users. OpenSea’s vision is to become the core destination for these new open digital economies to thrive, building the world’s friendliest and most trusted NFT marketplace with the best selection.\n\nThis is, of course, a story about NFTs, at least in part, and by extension, a story about the so-called Web 3 née crypto economy that its fiercest advocates say is the future. But there are two other parts of this story that are very much at home on the Internet as it exists in the present: $13 billion, and “core destination.”\nOpenSea’s Value\nFirst, two more OpenSea stories from over the break. From Be In Crypto:\n\n  NFT marketplace OpenSea has frozen $2.2 million worth of Bored Ape (BAYC) NFTs after they were reported as being stolen. The NFTs on the marketplace now have a warning saying that it is “reported for suspicious activity.” Buying and selling of such items are suspended…\n  Meanwhile, there is a bit of a squabble happening over OpenSea over the Phunky Ape Yacht Club (PAYC). The NFT platform banned this NFT series because it was based on the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. PAYC is virtually identical to BAYC, except for the fact it is mirrored.\n\nThis excerpt isn’t technically complete: buying and selling of the stolen NFTs — or of the PAYC NFTs — are suspended on OpenSea. The fact of the matter is that (references to) NFTs are, famously, stored on the blockchain (Ethereum in this case), and once those BAYC NFTs were transferred, by consent of their previous owner or not, the transaction cannot be undone without the consent of their new owner; said owner can buy or sell the NFTs to someone else, but not on OpenSea. It’s the same thing with with the BAYC rip-offs: they exist on the blockchain, whether or not OpenSea lists them for sale or not.\nThis, according to crypto advocates, is evidence of the allure of Web 3: because the blockchain is open and accessible by anyone, the stolen BAYC NFTs and the PAYC rip-offs can be sold on another market, or if one cannot be found, in a private transaction (leave aside, for the sake of argument and the brevity of this update, the question as to whether the fact that these transactions are irreversible is a feature or a bug).\nHere’s the thing, though: this isn’t a new concept. What is the first answer given to anyone who is banned from Twitter, or demonetized on YouTube — two of the go-to examples Web 3 advocates give about the problem of centralized power on the Internet today? Start your own Twitter, or start your own blog, or set up a Substack. These answers are frustrating because they are true: the web is open.\nIndeed, if this frustration sounds familiar, it is because it is the frustration of the regulator insisting that Aggregators are monopolies, that Google is somehow forcing users to not use Bing like some sort of railroad baron extorting farmers simply seeking to move grain to market, or that Facebook has a monopoly on social networking, ignoring the fact that we have far more ways to communicate than ever before.\nIn fact, what gives Aggregators their power is not their control of supply: they are not the only way to find websites, or to post your opinions online; rather, it is their control of demand. People are used to Google, or it is the default, so sites and advertisers don’t want to spend their time and money on alternatives; people want other people to see what they have to say, so they don’t want to risk writing a blog that no one reads, or spending time on a social network that because it lacks the network has no sense of social.\nThis is why regulations focused on undoing the control of supply are ineffective: the marginal cost nature of computing and the zero distribution cost of the Internet made it viable for the first time — and far more profitable — to control demand, not by forcing people to act against their will, but by making it easy for them to accomplish whatever it is they wished to do, whether that be find a website, buy a good, talk to their friends, or give their opinion. And now, to buy or sell NFTs.\nThis, then, is the reason that OpenSea received its $13 billion valuation: it is by far the dominant market for NFTs; should the market exist in the long run, the most likely entryway for end users will be OpenSea. This is a very profitable position to be in, even if alternatives are only a click away. It’s not like that reduces the profitability of a Google or a Facebook.\nIt is also why OpenSea’s bans have some amount of teeth to them: as I noted, you can still buy and sell these stolen and rip-off NFTs, just as you can still go to a website that is not listed in Google, communicate with a friend kicked off of Facebook, or state your opinions somewhere other than Twitter. The reduced demand, though, lowers the price, whether that price be traffic, convenience, or attention. Or, in the case of NFTs, ETH: not having access to OpenSea means there is less demand for these NFTs, and less demand means lower prices.\nIn short, OpenSea has power not because it controls the NFTs in question, but because it controls the vast majority of demand.\nCrypto’s Aggregators\nOne of the reasons that crypto is so interesting, at least in a theoretical sense, is that it seems like a natural antidote to Aggregators; I’ve suggested as such. After all, Aggregators are a product of abundance; scarcity is the opposite. The OpenSea example, though, is a reminder that I have forgotten one of my own arguments about Aggregators: demand matters more than supply.\nTo that end, which side of the equation is impacted by the blockchain? The answer, quite obviously is supply. Indeed, one need only be tangentially aware of crypto to realize that the primary goal of so many advocates is to convert non-believers, the better to increase demand. This has the inverse impact of OpenSea’s ban: increased demand increases prices for scarce supply, which is to say, in terms that are familiar to any Web 3 advocate, that the incentives of Web 3’s most ardent evangelists are very much aligned.\nThe most valuable assets in crypto remain tokens; Bitcoin and Ethereum lead the way with market caps of $874 billion and $451 billion, respectively. What is striking, though, is that the primary way that most users interact with Web 3 are via centralized companies like Coinbase and FTX on the exchange side, Discord for communication and community, and OpenSea for NFTs. It is also not a surprise: centralized companies deliver a better user experience, which encompasses everything from UI to security to at least knocking down the value of your stolen assets on your behalf; a better user experience leads to more users, which increases power over supply, further enhancing the user experience, in the virtual cycle described by Aggregation Theory.\nThat Aggregation Theory applies to Web 3 is not some sort of condemnation of the idea; it is, perhaps, a challenge to the insistence that crypto is something fundamentally different than the web. That’s fine — as I wrote before the break, the Internet is already pretty great, and its full value is only just starting to be exploited. And, as I argued in The Great Bifurcation, the most likely outcome is that crypto provides a useful layer on what already exists, as opposed to replacing it.\nMoreover, as I explained in a follow-up to The Great Bifurcation, this view of crypto’s role relative to the web places it firmly in an ongoing progression away from technical lock-in and towards network effects:\n\n  \n  This is a dramatic simplification, to be clear, but I think it is directionally correct; the long-term trend, all of the hysteria around tech notwithstanding, is towards more openness and less lock-in. At the same time, this doesn’t mean that companies are any less dominant; rather, their means of dominance has shifted from the technical to the sociological.\n\nCrypto, still largely valued on nothing more than the collective belief of its users, is the ultimate example to date of the power of a network, in every sense of the word.

      "content_text": "There is a perspective in which 2021 was an absolute drag: COVID dragged on, vaccines became politicized, new variants emerged, and while tech continued to provide the infrastructure that kept the economy moving, it also provided the infrastructure for all of those things that made this year feel so difficult.\nAt the same time, 2021 also provided a glimpse of a future beyond our current smartphone and social media-dominated paradigm: there was the Metaverse, and crypto, and my contention they are related. Sure, the old paradigm is increasingly dominated by regulation and politics, a topic that is so soul-sucking that it temporarily made me want to post less, but the brilliance of the Internet, and of business-models like that which undergirds Stratechery, is that freedom to not only write what you want, but build what you want, and be what you want, is greater than ever.\n\nThis year Stratechery published 40 free Weekly Articles and 121 Daily Updates, including 13 interviews. I also launched Passport, the new back-end for Stratechery and Dithering, the twice-a-week for-pay podcast I host with John Gruber; Passport remains under development, so stay tuned for updates in 2022.\n\nToday, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year on Stratechery.\nYou can find previous years here: 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013\nOn to 2021:\nThe Five Most-Viewed Articles\nThe five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:\n\nClubhouse’s Inevitability — I was very bullish on Clubhouse; unfortunately, it looks like I got this one completely wrong. I admitted to my error and explained my thinking in this Update.\nThe Relentless Jeff Bezos — Jeff Bezos is retiring, and will go down as one of the great CEO’s in tech history, in part because of how he transformed Amazon into a tech company in every respect.\nIntel Problems — Intel is in much more danger than its profits suggest; the problems are a long time in the making, and the solution is to split up the company. See also, Intel Unleashed, Gelsinger on Intel, IDM 2.0 and Intel vs. TSMC, How Samsung and TSMC Won, MAD Chips.\nInternet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History — The actions taken by Big Tech have a resonance that goes beyond the context of domestic U.S. politics. Even if they were right, they will still push the world to Internet 3.0.\nApple’s Mistake — While it’s possible to understand Apple’s motivations behind its decision to enable on-device scanning, the company had a better way to satisfy its societal obligations while preserving user privacy. See also, Apple Versus Governments, Apple’s Legitimate Privacy Claims, Privacy and Paranoia, Apple’s Point-of-View, NFTs and Status, NFTs and Standard Formats, and Facebook Messenger Updates, WhatsApp vs. Apple, Facebook’s CSAM Approach.\n\n\nThe Next Revolution\nSeveral posts throughout the year wrestled with the theory of the next revolution, from memes to metaverses:\n\nInternet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History — The actions taken by Big Tech have a resonance that goes beyond the context of domestic U.S. politics. Even if they were right, they will still push the world to Internet 3.0.\nMistakes and Memes — Information on the Internet is conveyed by memes, which can be anything and everything. The real world impacts are only now being understood.\nThe Death and Birth of Technological Revolutions — Carlota Perez documents technological revolutions, and thinks we’re in the middle of the current one; what, though, if we are nearing its maturation? Is crypto next?\nSequoia Productive Capital — Sequoia’s transformation of its venture capital model is actually a shift from financial capital to productive capital.\nThe Great Bifurcation — Tracing the evolution of tech’s three eras, and why the fourth era — the Metaverse — is defined by its bifurcation with the physical world.\n\nThe Metaverse\nSeveral posts this year worked to define the Metaverse and understand its role in the future:\n\nThe Roblox Microverse — Roblox is something new and interesting that abstracts away the platforms underneath it.\nMetaverses — The Metaverse of Snow Crash is not a good analogy for the future, as the Internet breaks down into Stephenson’s dystopia.\nMeta — Facebook’s reorganization into Meta is the ultimate bet on the power of founder control. See also my interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nMicrosoft and the Metaverse — Defining the Metaverse, and explaining why Microsoft is well-placed for the virtual reality opportunity. See also, Enterprise Metaverses, Horizon Workrooms, Workrooms’ Facebook Problem.\nUnity, Weta, and Faceless Platforms — Unity’s acquisition of Weta digital makes sense for both sides, and positions Unity to be an essential platform for tech’s future. See also my interview with Unity CEO John Riccitiello.\n\n\nPolitics & Regulation\nA lot of time — perhaps too much — was spent on politics and regulation:\n\nTrump and Twitter — After defending Trump’s right to social media I finally sided with those who thought that Twitter should suspend his account; I really don’t know that I got this right, especially after Twitter and Facebook ramped up censorship throughout the year, instead of stepping back. See also Facebook and Twitter Suspend Trump, Parler Suspended Everywhere, Context and Culture, Russia, Google and Apple; The App Firewall; Laptop Assumptions, and Facebook Files, Continued; Misinformation and Vaccinations; Fact-Checking and the Unknown.\nModeration in Infrastructure — Infrastructure companies need a distinct approach to moderation that focuses on neutrality and due process. See also my interviews with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, Microsoft President Brad Smith, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, and Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince.\nThe Web’s Missing Interoperability — Truly unlocking competition in tech means increasing interoperability; an absolutist approach to privacy is doing the exact opposite.\nRegulators and Reality — The FTC’s new Facebook case isn’t any better than the old one, even as there are ever more questions about the potential harm of regulatory interference. See also, Facebook Complaint Dismissed; Anti-Monopoly vs. Antitrust, Revisited; Where Facebook Lost.\nFacebook Political Problems — Facebook’s political problems stem directly from its size and drive for growth; they are societal issues, not antitrust ones. See also, The Facebook Files, Instagram and Teens, Facebook versus App Stores.\n\n\nThe App Store\nThe regulatory question that received the most attention this year was the App Store, thanks in large part to Apple’s legal tussle with Epic:\n\nApp Store Arguments — There are all kinds of arguments to make about the App Store, and nearly all of them are good ones; that’s why the best solution can only come from Apple.\nIntegrated Apple and App Store Risk — WWDC highlighted how Apple’s differentiation is based on integration; the company ought not risk that differentiation for exploitive App Store policies.\nThe Cicilline Salvo — A package of new proposed laws for regulating tech companies are in part a negotiating ploy, but also an indicator of change.\nTech Epochs and the App Store Trap — Centralized control is useful at the beginning of an economy, but limits innovation in the long run. That is as true for China as it is for the App Store.\nThe Apple v. Epic Decision — Understanding Apple’s victory in Apple v. Epic, and the limitations of the injunction on anti-steering provisions. See also, Apple’s Settlement, Explicit Imprimatur, Additional Notes, Apple’s App Store Concession, Why This is a Big Deal, Devil in the Details, and Apple Makes the Rules, Reader and Productivity Apps, High-spending Gamers.\n\nCreator Power\nA yearly theme on Stratechery is creator power, and the opportunities unlocked by the Internet:\n\nPublishing is Back to the Future — Journalism cannot afford to be divorced from business realities; that applies to Australia, the New York Times, and even Andreessen Horowitz.\nSovereign Writers and Substack — Substack is at the center of media controversy, most of which misses the point that sovereign writers — not Substack — are in control.\nNon-Fungible Taylor Swift — Taylor Swift, like Dave Chappelle, is leveraging the power of the Internet to take control of their art.\nSpotify’s Surprise — Spotify’s new subscription podcast offerings embrace the open ecosystem of podcasts in multiple ways. See also, Podcast Subscriptions vs. the App Store.\nMarket-Making on the Internet — More and more opportunities on the web come from market marking, not for advertisers, but for real goods and services paid for with real money.\n\n\nCompany Analysis\nWhile most Stratechery company analysis happens in the Update, there were a number of relevant Articles as well:\n\nThe Lightness of Windows — The Windows 11 announcement was fun and interesting, but there is a reason that Windows is no longer the center of Microsoft’s business.\nInstagram’s Evolution — Instagram’s shift away from being a photo-sharing app is very much inline with the service’s continuous evolution.\nDistribution and Demand — Distribution on the Internet is free; what matters is controlling demand. AT&T and Verizon didn’t understand the distinction. See also, AT&T’s Original Bad Deal, Discovery + WarnerMedia, The Streaming Landscape.\nCloudflare’s Disruption — Cloudflare’s new storage offering is potentially disruptive both economically and strategically. See also: Cloudflare on the Edge — Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to become a major player in an Internet 3.0 world, where politics matter more than economics.\nThe Amazon Empire Strikes Back — Amazon’s logistics investment makes the company increasingly attractive to 3rd party merchants.\n\n\nStratechery Interviews\nThis year’s Stratechery interviews included:\n\nJay Goldberg about chips, Intel, and Apple.\nEric Seufert about advertising and Apple versus Facebook (and a follow-up interview about the impact of ATT).\nPatrick Collison, Brad Smith, Thomas Kurian, and Matthew Prince about moderation in infrastructure.\nDan Wang about the U.S. and China (and a follow-up interview about China’s tech crackdown).\nNathan Hubbard about Taylor Swift and the future of music.\nBrad Stone about Amazon and Jeff Bezos.\nSundar Pichai about the future of Google.

See also, Interoperability Defined, AppLovin Files S-1, The Facebook-Shopify Value Chain.\nMistakes, Memes, and Foreign Ground; Coronavirus Context; The New York Times and the China Model — Considering a world of memes is uncomfortable, and perhaps explains why journalists want a world of information control. The problem is that we will never be better at this than China.\nGoogle Makes Deal With News Corp, Facebook Blocks News in Australia, Microsoft’s Cynicism — Google gives in in Australia, not to the government, but to News Corp. Facebook, meanwhile, pulls out; they are right on the merits, but terrible at the politics.\nNonfungible Tokens, NBA Top Shot, The Creation of Consumption — NFTs are useful not simply because they are unique, but because they are an easy-to-understand way to understand the importance of blockchains. See also, ConstitutionDAO, The Need for Trust, Memes and Reality and Apple’s MacBook Pro Event; The Bitcoin Futures ETF; Bitcoin, Regulation, and Utility.\nSpotify Stream On, Spotify’s Advertising Play, Additional Notes on Stream On — Spotify’s Stream On event advertised Spotify’s ambitions to become an Aggregator. The plans were impressive, but should Spotify go even further?\nThe Automotive Chip Shortage, Cheap and Complex, A Useful Crisis — The chip shortage facing the automobile industry has more to do with the auto industry’s failure to understand chips than a lack of U.S. capacity; still, a crisis in one area might fix another.

      "content_html": "<p>For <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/?s=The+State+of+Technology\">the first several years</a> of Stratechery I would write a year end article about &#8220;The State of Consumer Technology&#8221;; the last one I wrote, though, was in 2018, because consumer technology, dominated as it was by Apple and Google on the device side, and Google and Facebook on the services side, seemed rather stale and destined to descend into the world of politics and regulation (I was more optimistic about the enterprise, both in terms of the ongoing shift to the public cloud and the opportunity for SaaS companies).</p>\n<p>That has largely proven to be the case, but it&#8217;s not the first time this has happened to technology; the pattern has happened twice before, and in each case the seeds of the next era were planted — usually by incumbents — while the previous era stagnated. And, in every case, the transition was marked by a reduction in lock-in and the devolvement of increasing amounts of autonomy to the individual user.</p>\n<h4>Tech 1.0: From Invention to IBM</h4>\n<p>The transistor, the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/\">foundation of modern computing</a>, was invented at Bell Labs in 1947 by the solid state physics group led by William Shockley; nine years later Shockley moved to Mountain View, California to be close to his ailing mother in Palo Alto, where he started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. Eight of the researchers he hired, led by Bob Noyce, left the increasingly erratic Shockley a year later to found Fairchild Semiconductor, and in 1968 founded Intel with the support of Arthur Rock, one of the first venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>The West Coast, though, was a sideshow compared to New York, where IBM had switched to transistors for the 7000 Series mainframe (as opposed to the 700 Series&#8217; vacuum tubes); the real breakthrough was the modular and expandable System/360, which was the first computer bought by most companies, including the fictional SC&amp;P from <em>Mad Men</em>:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zU0nM1IC1hA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There certainly was a connection to be drawn between IBM and the moon: IBM helped develop and track NASA&#8217;s initial exploratory flights and the eventual lunar mission. Here on earth, though, the Justice Department decided in 1969 that the company was in violation of antitrust laws; the case would be dropped 13 years later, but not before IBM voluntarily unbundled its software and services from its hardware, creating the first market for software.</p>\n<h4>Tech 2.0: King of the Hill</h4>\n<p>Notice those dates: by the time the Department of Justice sued IBM in 1969, Intel had already been founded; two years later an Intel engineer named Frederico Faggin designed the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, which shrunk many of the functions of IBM&#8217;s room-sized computers to a single chip.  Ten years after that IBM released the IBM PC, powered by Intel&#8217;s 8088 microprocessor.</p>\n<p>The open nature of the IBM PC platform — at least once Compaq backward-engineered IBM&#8217;s BIOS — commoditized PCs; the real points of leverage in the PC value chain were Intel for chips and Windows for the operating system. The latter was a two-sided market: because so many businesses bought the Windows DOS-powered IBM PC, developers were motivated to make software for DOS; the more software for DOS, and later Windows (which was backwards compatible), the more that businesses sought out DOS/Windows-based computers. Over time more and more people who first used computers at work wanted similar functionality at home, which meant that DOS/Windows dominated the consumer market as well.</p>\n<p>Thus was born another Justice Department lawsuit, this time against Microsoft&#8217;s alleged monopoly; that case was also eventually dismissed (although it lived on in various forms in the E.U. for years). Once again, though, the next paradigm that rendered the seeming monopolist&#8217;s lock-in immaterial was already in place: the Internet could be accessed from any computer, no matter its operating system. Moreover, in an echo of IBM&#8217;s voluntary unbundling of hardware and software, which created the conditions for tech&#8217;s next evolution, it was Microsoft that introduced the <em>XMLHttpRequest</em> API to Internet Explorer, which undergirded the Ajax web app architecture and Tech 3.0.</p>\n<h4>Tech 3.0: Software Eats the World</h4>\n<p>If Tech 1.0 was about hardware, and 2.0 software, 3.0 was about services. On the enterprise side this meant the development of the public cloud and software-as-a-service applications that required nothing more than a browser and a credit card; Marc Andreessen&#8217;s famous 2011 essay, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">Software Is Eating the World</a>, is really about this transformation from software you installed on your computer to software you accessed over the Internet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Companies in every industry need to assume that a software revolution is coming. This includes even industries that are software-based today. Great incumbent software companies like Oracle and Microsoft are increasingly threatened with irrelevance by new software offerings like Salesforce.com and Android (especially in a world where Google owns a major handset maker).</p>\n<p>  In some industries, particularly those with a heavy real-world component such as oil and gas, the software revolution is primarily an opportunity for incumbents. But in many industries, new software ideas will result in the rise of new Silicon Valley-style start-ups that invade existing industries with impunity. Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and software-powered insurgents will be epic. Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who coined the term &#8220;creative destruction,&#8221; would be proud.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>One way to think about this is that tech, for the first 50 years of its existence, mostly competed with itself: who could make the best operating system, the best database, the best ERP system. All of these were then adopted by legacy businesses who saw large efficiency gains. The SaaS revolution, though, saw tech turning its sights on the markets those legacy businesses served, bringing to bear entirely new ways of solving problems that started with the malleability and scalability of software as a core principle, not simply as a tool to do the same thing more efficiently.</p>\n<p>The consumer space, meanwhile, has arguably been a decade behind the enterprise; e-commerce, for example, was primarily an Amazon story, and social media was all about Facebook. Both took analog concepts and digitized them: Amazon was the Sears and Roebucks catalog with far more products and far faster delivery; Facebook was literally named after a physical artifact, Harvard House face books.</p>\n<p>What made Facebook so popular — and why the product retains its stickiness, even today — is that it is first and foremost the online representation of your offline relationships, whether those be family, classmates, friends, or co-workers. This also explains why the most successful Facebook add-ons, like Marketplace and Groups, are themselves often rooted in the physical world. These relationships represent a network effect — the more people you know who are on Facebook, the more valuable it is to you — and once again regulators have come knocking, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/regulators-and-reality/\">in this case the FTC</a>.</p>\n<p>Note, though, that these cases are, if anything, becoming weaker over time, at least in terms of traditional antitrust concerns: while IBM&#8217;s market power was based on top-to-bottom integration that completely foreclosed competitors, Microsoft&#8217;s was about a two-sided network that was wide open for developers and users. Facebook, meanwhile, only has its users and their relationships to each other; that is the only thing preventing anyone from using another service.<sup id=\"rf1-8200\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-great-bifurcation/#fn1-8200\" title=\"When it comes to e-commerce, the shift is similar: not only are other large e-commerce providers like Walmart a click away, individual merchants, largely &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/&quot;&gt;powered by Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, are growing even faster than Amazon.\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Which, of course, they are.</p>\n<h4>Social Networking 2.0</h4>\n<p>Last December I wrote what was, in retrospect, an important precursor to this piece (consider it my 2020 State of Technology article): <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/social-networking-2-0/\">Social Networking 2.0</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  [My Bucks DM group is] not my only online community: while the writing of Stratechery is a solo affair, building new features like the Daily Update Podcast or simply dealing with ongoing administrative affairs requires a team that is scattered around the world; we hang out in Slack. Another group of tech enthusiast friends is in another Slack, and a third, primarily folks from Silicon Valley, is in WhatsApp. Meanwhile, I have friends and family centered in Wisconsin (we use iMessage), and, of course Taiwan (LINE for family, WhatsApp for friends). The end result is something I am proud of:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/social-networking-2-0/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-3.png?resize=640%2C407&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of Ben&#039;s Communities\" width=\"640\" height=\"407\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5490\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-3.png?resize=1024%2C651&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-3.png?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-3.png?resize=768%2C488&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-3.png?resize=991%2C630&amp;ssl=1 991w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  The pride arises from a piece of advice I received when I announced I was moving back to Taiwan seven years ago: a mentor was worried about how I would find the support and friendship everyone needs if I were living halfway around the world; he told me that while it wouldn’t be ideal, perhaps I could piece together friendships in different spaces as a way to make do. In fact, not only have I managed to do exactly that, I firmly believe the outcome is a superior one, and reason for optimism in a tech landscape sorely in need of it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The argument in that piece is that Facebook and Twitter represented Social Networking 1.0, where you were expected to be your whole self online; that expectation, though, was like a legacy company using computers to run their analog business model: it may have been more efficient, but it wasn&#8217;t at all an optimal use of technology. The entire magic of software is that it is malleable and scalable, and those qualities extend to users creating completely different personas and experiences based on the particular online community that they have joined.</p>\n<p>Facebook, incidentally, like IBM and Microsoft in previous eras, has contributed to this evolution, particularly its acquisition and continued support of WhatsApp: while groups exist on all sorts of platforms, from Twitter to Facebook Groups to iMessage, WhatsApp seems to have a major share of these ad hoc private groups, particularly internationally but increasingly in the U.S. as well. What is notable about WhatsApp is that the key identifier is not your account, but rather your phone number; any sort of technological lock-in has completely disappeared.</p>\n<h4>Tech 4.0: The Metaverse</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest topics of 2021 has been the Metaverse, thanks in large part to <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/meta/\">Facebook&#8217;s pivot to Meta</a> (even if <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/\">Microsoft was first</a>). It has been tricky, though, to define <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/\">exactly what the Metaverse is</a>: everyone has <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/unity-buys-weta-digital-an-interview-with-unity-ceo-john-riccitiello/\">a different definition</a>.</p>\n<p>I think, though, I have settled on mine, and it starts with <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse/\">this comment from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I think that the phrase “the real world” is interesting. I think that there’s a physical world and there’s a digital world, and increasingly those are sort of being overlaid and coming together, but I would argue that increasingly the real world is the combination of the digital world and the physical world and that the real world is not just the physical world. That, I think, is an interesting kind of frame to think about this stuff going forward.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I both agree and disagree with Zuckerberg; on one hand, I think he is absolutely correct that using &#8220;the real world&#8221; to only apply to the physical world is a mistake. Think back to those communities I described above that provide so much meaning to my life: those are almost completely online, but the sense of belonging is very real to me. Or think of this Article you are reading: it is nothing but endlessly replicable bits on the Internet, yet it is my career.</p>\n<p>Where I disagree is with the idea that the physical world and the digital world are increasingly &#8220;being overlaid and coming together&#8221;; in fact, I think the opposite is happening: the physical world and digital world are increasingly bifurcating. Again, to use myself as an example, my physical reality is defined by my life in Taiwan with my family; the majority of my time and energy, though, is online, defined by interactions with friends, co-workers, and customers scattered all over the world.</p>\n<p>For a long time I felt somewhat unique in this regard, but COVID has made my longstanding reality the norm for many more people. Their physical world is defined by their family and hometown, which no longer needs to be near their work, which is entirely online; everything from friends to entertainment has followed the same path.</p>\n<p>Thus my definition: the Metaverse is the set of experiences that are completely online, and thus defined by their malleability and scalability, which is to say that the Metaverse is already here. Sure, today&#8217;s experience is largely denominated by text and 2D, but video is already a major medium, first in the form of entertainment and now a vital tool for work. This is a trajectory that, in my estimation, inexorably leads to virtual reality: if all that matters is digital, why wouldn&#8217;t you want the most immersive experience possible?</p>\n<h4>Crypto&#8217;s Role</h4>\n<p>This also explains why crypto is interesting. Stephen Diehl, in a scathing article entitled <a href=\"https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/web3-bullshit.html\">Web3 is Bullshit</a>, writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  At its core web3 is a vapid marketing campaign that attempts to reframe the public’s negative associations of crypto assets into a false narrative about disruption of legacy tech company hegemony. It is a distraction in the pursuit of selling more coins and continuing the gravy train of evading securities regulation. We see this manifest in the circularity in which the crypto and web3 movement talks about itself. It’s not about solving real consumer problems. The only problem to be solved by web3 is how to post-hoc rationalize its own existence.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first part isn&#8217;t entirely unfair; scams and ponzi schemes are everywhere, and it seems clear that we are in the middle of an ever-inflating bubble. It&#8217;s also the case that an entire set of legitimate use cases are in reality regulatory arbitrage; crypto advocates are far too quick to ascribe all of the issues with the current monetary system to greed and corruption, without acknowledging that complex systems arise for very good reasons. And, along those same lines, Web3 evangelists often sound like overbearing regulators ascribing the dominance of the biggest tech companies to illegal lock-in, without acknowledging that Aggregators win because they provide the user experience consumers want (and which crypto applications currently sorely lack).</p>\n<p>The second part, though, is less compelling to me, even if it is a restatement of the most common crypto criticism: &#8220;None of this digital stuff has any real world value.&#8221; The real world, of course, is the physical world, and I get the critique; I am very skeptical that crypto currencies are going to replace fiat currencies, or be otherwise useful in the physical world, or that <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/constitutiondao-the-need-for-trust-memes-and-reality/\">DAOs</a> are going to replace LLCs or corporations for real world companies.</p>\n<p>Remember, though, my definition of the Metaverse as a set of experiences that are completely online. It is here that physical world constraints don&#8217;t make any sense. I can&#8217;t, for example, have a conversation with multiple, distinct groups of people at the same time, yet I do exactly that every day — I even have an entire monitor on my desktop devoted to nothing but chat clients! In this world having one account that represents my whole self, like that offered by Facebook, is a pain in the rear end; for now I have multiple accounts for each individual service, but as I noted, some of them are already based on my unique phone number. How much better if every account were based on a digital identifier unique to me and owned by no one, and now you understand the case for crypto wallets.</p>\n<p>This gets to the other mistake Diehl makes in that article, which, ironically, echoes a similar mistake made by many crypto absolutists: there is no reason why the Metaverse, or any web application for that matter, will be built on the blockchain. Why would you use the world&#8217;s slowest database when a centralized one is far more scalable and performant? It is not as if WhatsApp or Signal are built on top of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service\">plain old telephone service</a>; they simply leverage the fact that phone numbers are unique and thus suitable as identifiers. This is the type of role blockchains will fill: provide uniqueness and portability where necessary, in a way that makes it possible to not just live your life entirely online, but as many lives simultaneously as your might wish, locked in nowhere.</p>\n<h4>The Great Bifurcation</h4>\n<p>I noted above that the physical and digital worlds are bifurcating, and this is happening to tech as well. Yesterday Elon Musk was named <a href=\"https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2021-elon-musk/\">TIME&#8217;s 2021 Person of the Year</a>, and while he is known for his tweets about Dogecoin and on-and-off-again support of Bitcoin, his biggest contributions to the world — electrical cars and reusable rockets — are very much physical. In fact, you could make the case that Tesla and SpaceX aren&#8217;t tech companies at all, but rather another example of tech-first companies set on remaking industries that only ever saw computers as a tool, not the foundation.</p>\n<p>The Metaverse, in contrast, is not about eating the world; it&#8217;s about creating an entirely new one, from entertainment to community to money to identity. If Elon Musk wants to go to the moon, Mark Zuckerberg wants to create entirely new moons in digital space. This is a place where LLCs make no sense, where regulations are an after-thought, easily circumvented even if they exist. This is a place with no need for traditional money, or traditional art; the native solution is obviously superior. To put it another way, &#8220;None of this real world stuff has any digital world value&#8221; — the critique goes both ways.</p>\n<p>In the end, the most important connection between the Metaverse and the physical world will be you: right now you are in the Metaverse, reading this Article; perhaps you will linger on Twitter or get started with your remote work. And then you&#8217;ll stand up from your computer, or take off your headset, eat dinner and tuck in your kids, aware that their bifurcated future will be fundamentally different from your unitary past.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-great-bifurcation-follow-up-more-on-intel-and-tsmc-intel-to-spin-out-mobileye/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-8200\"><p >When it comes to e-commerce, the shift is similar: not only are other large e-commerce providers like Walmart a click away, individual merchants, largely <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">powered by Shopify</a>, are growing even faster than Amazon.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-great-bifurcation/#rf1-8200\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "For the first several years of Stratechery I would write a year end article about “The State of Consumer Technology”; the last one I wrote, though, was in 2018, because consumer technology, dominated as it was by Apple and Google on the device side, and Google and Facebook on the services side, seemed rather stale and destined to descend into the world of politics and regulation (I was more optimistic about the enterprise, both in terms of the ongoing shift to the public cloud and the opportunity for SaaS companies).\nThat has largely proven to be the case, but it’s not the first time this has happened to technology; the pattern has happened twice before, and in each case the seeds of the next era were planted — usually by incumbents — while the previous era stagnated. And, in every case, the transition was marked by a reduction in lock-in and the devolvement of increasing amounts of autonomy to the individual user.\nTech 1.0: From Invention to IBM\nThe transistor, the foundation of modern computing, was invented at Bell Labs in 1947 by the solid state physics group led by William Shockley; nine years later Shockley moved to Mountain View, California to be close to his ailing mother in Palo Alto, where he started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. Eight of the researchers he hired, led by Bob Noyce, left the increasingly erratic Shockley a year later to found Fairchild Semiconductor, and in 1968 founded Intel with the support of Arthur Rock, one of the first venture capitalists.\nThe West Coast, though, was a sideshow compared to New York, where IBM had switched to transistors for the 7000 Series mainframe (as opposed to the 700 Series’ vacuum tubes); the real breakthrough was the modular and expandable System/360, which was the first computer bought by most companies, including the fictional SC&P from Mad Men:\n\nThere certainly was a connection to be drawn between IBM and the moon: IBM helped develop and track NASA’s initial exploratory flights and the eventual lunar mission. Here on earth, though, the Justice Department decided in 1969 that the company was in violation of antitrust laws; the case would be dropped 13 years later, but not before IBM voluntarily unbundled its software and services from its hardware, creating the first market for software.\nTech 2.0: King of the Hill\nNotice those dates: by the time the Department of Justice sued IBM in 1969, Intel had already been founded; two years later an Intel engineer named Frederico Faggin designed the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, which shrunk many of the functions of IBM’s room-sized computers to a single chip.  Ten years after that IBM released the IBM PC, powered by Intel’s 8088 microprocessor.\nThe open nature of the IBM PC platform — at least once Compaq backward-engineered IBM’s BIOS — commoditized PCs; the real points of leverage in the PC value chain were Intel for chips and Windows for the operating system. The latter was a two-sided market: because so many businesses bought the Windows DOS-powered IBM PC, developers were motivated to make software for DOS; the more software for DOS, and later Windows (which was backwards compatible), the more that businesses sought out DOS/Windows-based computers. Over time more and more people who first used computers at work wanted similar functionality at home, which meant that DOS/Windows dominated the consumer market as well.\nThus was born another Justice Department lawsuit, this time against Microsoft’s alleged monopoly; that case was also eventually dismissed (although it lived on in various forms in the E.U. for years). Once again, though, the next paradigm that rendered the seeming monopolist’s lock-in immaterial was already in place: the Internet could be accessed from any computer, no matter its operating system. Moreover, in an echo of IBM’s voluntary unbundling of hardware and software, which created the conditions for tech’s next evolution, it was Microsoft that introduced the XMLHttpRequest API to Internet Explorer, which undergirded the Ajax web app architecture and Tech 3.0.\nTech 3.0: Software Eats the World\nIf Tech 1.0 was about hardware, and 2.0 software, 3.0 was about services. On the enterprise side this meant the development of the public cloud and software-as-a-service applications that required nothing more than a browser and a credit card; Marc Andreessen’s famous 2011 essay, Software Is Eating the World, is really about this transformation from software you installed on your computer to software you accessed over the Internet:\n\n  Companies in every industry need to assume that a software revolution is coming. This includes even industries that are software-based today. Great incumbent software companies like Oracle and Microsoft are increasingly threatened with irrelevance by new software offerings like Salesforce.com and Android (especially in a world where Google owns a major handset maker).\n  In some industries, particularly those with a heavy real-world component such as oil and gas, the software revolution is primarily an opportunity for incumbents. But in many industries, new software ideas will result in the rise of new Silicon Valley-style start-ups that invade existing industries with impunity. Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and software-powered insurgents will be epic. Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who coined the term “creative destruction,” would be proud.\n\nOne way to think about this is that tech, for the first 50 years of its existence, mostly competed with itself: who could make the best operating system, the best database, the best ERP system. All of these were then adopted by legacy businesses who saw large efficiency gains. The SaaS revolution, though, saw tech turning its sights on the markets those legacy businesses served, bringing to bear entirely new ways of solving problems that started with the malleability and scalability of software as a core principle, not simply as a tool to do the same thing more efficiently.\nThe consumer space, meanwhile, has arguably been a decade behind the enterprise; e-commerce, for example, was primarily an Amazon story, and social media was all about Facebook. Both took analog concepts and digitized them: Amazon was the Sears and Roebucks catalog with far more products and far faster delivery; Facebook was literally named after a physical artifact, Harvard House face books.\nWhat made Facebook so popular — and why the product retains its stickiness, even today — is that it is first and foremost the online representation of your offline relationships, whether those be family, classmates, friends, or co-workers. This also explains why the most successful Facebook add-ons, like Marketplace and Groups, are themselves often rooted in the physical world. These relationships represent a network effect — the more people you know who are on Facebook, the more valuable it is to you — and once again regulators have come knocking, in this case the FTC.\nNote, though, that these cases are, if anything, becoming weaker over time, at least in terms of traditional antitrust concerns: while IBM’s market power was based on top-to-bottom integration that completely foreclosed competitors, Microsoft’s was about a two-sided network that was wide open for developers and users. Facebook, meanwhile, only has its users and their relationships to each other; that is the only thing preventing anyone from using another service.1\nWhich, of course, they are.\nSocial Networking 2.0\nLast December I wrote what was, in retrospect, an important precursor to this piece (consider it my 2020 State of Technology article): Social Networking 2.0.\n\n  [My Bucks DM group is] not my only online community: while the writing of Stratechery is a solo affair, building new features like the Daily Update Podcast or simply dealing with ongoing administrative affairs requires a team that is scattered around the world; we hang out in Slack. Another group of tech enthusiast friends is in another Slack, and a third, primarily folks from Silicon Valley, is in WhatsApp. Meanwhile, I have friends and family centered in Wisconsin (we use iMessage), and, of course Taiwan (LINE for family, WhatsApp for friends).

From <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html\">CNBC</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  For years, Amazon has been quietly chartering private cargo ships, making its own containers, and leasing planes to better control the complicated shipping journey of an online order. Now, as many retailers panic over supply chain chaos, Amazon’s costly early moves are helping it avoid the long wait times for available dock space and workers at the country’s busiest ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles…</p>\n<p>  By chartering private cargo vessels to carry its goods, Amazon can control where its goods go, avoiding the most congested ports. Still, Amazon has seen a 14% rise in out-of-stock items and an average price increase of 25% since January 2021, according to e-commerce management platform CommerceIQ…</p>\n<p>  Amazon has been on a spending spree to control as much of the shipping process as possible. It spent more than $61 billion on shipping in 2020, up from just under $38 billion in 2019. Now, Amazon is shipping 72% of its own packages, up from less than 47% in 2019 according to SJ Consulting Group. It’s even taking control at the first step of the shipping journey by making its own 53-foot cargo containers in China. Containers are in short supply, with long wait times and prices surging from less than $2,000 before the pandemic to $20,000 today.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The intended takeaway of this article — which <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html\">originated as a digital special report</a> — is clear: Amazon is better and smarter and richer than any other retailers, and isn&#8217;t suffering the same sort of supply chain challenges that everyone else is this Christmas.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll get to who the intended target for this message is in a moment, but there is an important question that needs to be asked first: is this even true?</p>\n<h4>Shipping and the Supply Chain</h4>\n<p>Start with those containers; the vast majority of shipping containers come in two sizes: 20 foot (i.e. 1 TEU — twenty-foot equivalent unit) and 40 foot (2 TEUs); there are a small number of 45 foot containers, but there is one number that does not exist — 53 foot containers. This isn&#8217;t simply a matter of will; what made containers so revolutionary was their standardization, which not only extends to ships but also the gantry cranes used to load and unload them, the truck chassis used to move them around ports, and the storage racks that hold them until they can be unloaded and their contents transferred onto semi tractor-trailers.</p>\n<p>Guess, by the way, how long those trailers are? 53 feet. In other words, yes, Amazon has been making a whole bunch of containers, but those containers are not and can not be used for shipping; they are an investment into Amazon&#8217;s <em>domestic</em> delivery capability.</p>\n<p>This investment is vast: Amazon is also leasing planes, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/amazon-opens-1point5-billion-kentucky-air-hub-in-bid-to-speed-deliveries.html\">just opened</a> a new Air Hub in Cincinnati (Amazon was previously leasing DHL&#8217;s package hub during off hours), built (or is building) over 400 distribution and sortation centers in the United States alone, and has farmed out a huge delivery fleet to independent operators who exist only to serve Amazon, all with the goal of cost efficiently getting orders to customers within two days, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/day-two-to-one-day/\">and eventually one</a>.</p>\n<p>This vertical integration, though, stops at the ocean, for reasons that are obvious once you think through the economics of shipping. While container ships can range as high as 18,000 TEUs, a typical trans-Pacific ship is about 8,000 TEUs (which is around 6,500 fully loaded containers), and costs around $100 million. Right off the bat you can see that shipping has a massive fixed cost component that dictates that the asset in question be utilized as much as possible. More than that, the marginal costs per trip — it takes around seven weeks to do a trans-Pacific round trip in normal times — is significant as well, around $5 million. This means that the ship has to be as fully loaded as possible.</p>\n<p>The only way that this works is if a smaller number of shipping companies are serving a larger number of customers, and doing so on a set schedule such that those customers can easily coordinate their logistics (which means that all of those capex and opex numbers have be multiplied by 7, to guarantee a sailing-per-week). Amazon couldn&#8217;t profitably leverage an investment of this magnitude any more than Apple could profitably run its own foundry; in that case TSMC can justify an investment in a <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3805032\">$20 billion fab</a> because its broad customer base gives the company confidence it can fully utilize that investment not just in 2023 but for many years into the future. It&#8217;s the same thing with shipping, which is to say that Amazon is in the same boat as everyone else — mostly.</p>\n<h4>Amazon Freight-Forwarding</h4>\n<p>That CNBC story follows on a similar story <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/amazon-s-christmas-shipping-plan-to-combat-global-supply-chain-crisis?sref=5KSwFgaY\">in Bloomberg</a> last month that opens with an anecdote about one of Amazon&#8217;s workarounds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Most cargo ships putting into the port of Everett, Washington, brim with cement and lumber.

A freight-forwarder is basically a middleman in the supply chain which buys a guaranteed amount of space on ships, often via multi-year contracts at guaranteed rates with guaranteed space, and then re-sells that space to people who need it. This means that Amazon could, if they wanted to, make massive profits by reselling space they negotiated last year, but instead it appears that the company is offering space at cost to its resellers; this is the most important part of that Bloomberg article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This logistical prowess hasn’t been lost on the merchants who sell products on Amazon’s sprawling marketplace. For years, they resisted using the company’s global shipping service because doing so means sharing information about pricing and suppliers, data they fear the company could use to compete with them. But container shortages in the leadup to the holiday season persuaded many of them to overcome their qualms and entrust their cargos to the world’s largest online retailer. “Amazon had space on ships and I couldn’t say no to anyone,” says David Knopfler, whose Brooklyn-based Lights.com sells home décor and lighting fixtures. “If Kim Jong Un had a container, I might take it, too.

      "content_text": "It seems like a Christmas miracle. From CNBC:\n\n  For years, Amazon has been quietly chartering private cargo ships, making its own containers, and leasing planes to better control the complicated shipping journey of an online order. Now, as many retailers panic over supply chain chaos, Amazon’s costly early moves are helping it avoid the long wait times for available dock space and workers at the country’s busiest ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles…\n  By chartering private cargo vessels to carry its goods, Amazon can control where its goods go, avoiding the most congested ports. Still, Amazon has seen a 14% rise in out-of-stock items and an average price increase of 25% since January 2021, according to e-commerce management platform CommerceIQ…\n  Amazon has been on a spending spree to control as much of the shipping process as possible. It spent more than $61 billion on shipping in 2020, up from just under $38 billion in 2019.

Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief technology officer, will take over the helm, the company said Monday. Shares of Twitter closed down 2.74% on the day.</p>\n<p>  Dorsey, 45, was serving as both the CEO of Twitter and Square, his digital payments company. Dorsey will remain a member of the board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders, the company said.

That agreement, though, came with the condition that Twitter grow its user base, speed up revenue growth, and gain digital ad market share.</p>\n<p>Twitter has made progress: while the company&#8217;s monthly active users have been stagnant for years — which is probably why the company stopped reporting them in 2019 — its &#8220;monetizable daily active users&#8221; have increased from 166 million in Q1 2020 to 211 million last quarter, and its trailing twelve-month revenue has increased from $3.5 billion in Q1 2020 to $4.8 billion in Q3 2021. The rub is digital ad market share: Snap, for example, grew its TTM revenue from $1.9 billion to $4.0 billion over the same period, as the pandemic proved to be a massive boon <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/apple-earnings-microsoft-and-linkedin/\">for many ad-driven platforms</a>.</p>\n<p>That boon was driven by the surge in e-commerce, which is powered by direct response marketing, where there is a tight link between seeing an ad and making a purchase; Twitter, though, has <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/?s=twitter+direct+response\">struggled for years</a> to build a direct response business, leaving it dependent on brand advertising for 85% of its ad revenue. That meant the company was not only not helped by the pandemic, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/qualcomm-follow-up-twitter-earnings-twitter-subscriptions/\">but hurt worse than most</a> (and, on the flip side, was less affected by Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 changes). If in fact Dorsey&#8217;s job depended on taking digital ad market share, he didn&#8217;t stand a chance.</p>\n<p>That perhaps explains yesterday&#8217;s weird timing; <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/jack-steps-back\">Casey Newton speculated</a> that the board may have leaked the news to ensure that Dorsey didn&#8217;t get cold feet. It also, I suspect, explains the market&#8217;s cool reaction to the appointment of an insider: Agrawal was there for all of those previously failed attempts to build a direct response marketing business, so it&#8217;s not entirely clear what is going to be different going forward.</p>\n<h4>Twitter&#8217;s Advertising Problem</h4>\n<p>The messiness I alluded to in Twitter&#8217;s previous CEO transitions is merely markers on a general run of mismanagement from the company&#8217;s earliest days. I&#8217;ve long contended that Twitter&#8217;s core problem is that the product was too perfect right off the bat; from 2014&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/twitter-market/\">Twitter&#8217;s Marketing Problem</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  One of the most common Silicon Valley phrases is “Product-Market Fit.” Back when he blogged on a blog, instead of through numbered tweets, Marc Andreessen <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070701074943/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the-pmarca-gu-2.html\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit…I believe that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts: before product/market fit (call this “BPMF”) and after product/market fit (“APMF”).</p>\n<p>    When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.</p>\n<p>    Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to, telling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required.</p>\n<p>    When you get right down to it, you can ignore almost everything else.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  I think this actually gets to the problem with Twitter: the initial concept was so good, and so perfectly fit such a large market, that they never needed to go through the process of achieving product market fit. It just happened, and they’ve been riding that match for going on eight years.</p>\n<p>  The problem, though, was that by skipping over the wrenching process of finding a market, Twitter still has no idea what their market actually is, and how they might expand it. Twitter is the company-equivalent of a lottery winner who never actually learns how to make money, and now they are starting to pay the price.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seven years on and Twitter has finally started to implement some of the proposals from that article, including leaning heavily into recommendations and topics; in theory the machine learning understandings driving those recommendations should translate into more effective advertising as well. That hasn&#8217;t really happened, though, and I&#8217;m not sure it ever will, for reasons that go beyond the effectiveness of Twitter&#8217;s management (or lack thereof).</p>\n<p>Think about the contrast between Twitter and Instagram; both are unique amongst social networks in that they follow a broadcast model: tweets on Twitter and photos on Instagram are public by default, and anyone can follow anyone. The default medium, though, is fundamentally different: Twitter has photos and videos, but the heart of the service is text (and links). Instagram, on the other hand, is nothing but photos and video (and link in bio).</p>\n<p>The implications of this are vast. Sure, you may follow your friends on both, but on Twitter you will also follow news breakers, analysts, insightful anons, joke tellers, and shit posters. The goal is to mainline information, and Twitter&#8217;s speed and information density are unparalleled by anything in the world. On Instagram, though, you might follow brands and influencers, and your chief interaction with your friends is stories about their Turkey Day exploits. It&#8217;s about aspiration, not information, and the former makes a lot more sense for effective advertising.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s more than just the medium though; it&#8217;s about the user&#8217;s mental state as well. Instagram is leisurely and an escape, something you do when you&#8217;re procrastinating; Twitter is intense and combative, and far more likely to be tied to something happening in the physical world, whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=640%2C373&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Instagram is a lean-back experience; on Twitter you lean forward\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8120\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?w=857&amp;ssl=1 857w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This matters for advertising, particularly advertising that depends on a direct response: when you are leaning back and relaxed why not click through to that Shopify site to buy that knick-knack you didn&#8217;t even know you needed, or try out that mobile game?

Facebook <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/\">hollowed out</a> the gatekeeper position of the media, but that void was filled by Twitter, both in terms of news being made, and just as critically, elite opinion and narrative being shaped.</p>\n<p>Given that impact, I can see why Elliott Management would look at Twitter and wonder why it is that the company can&#8217;t manage to make more money, but the fact that Twitter is the nexus of online information flow reflects the reality of information on the Internet: massively impactful and economically worthless, particularly when ads — which themselves are digital information — can easily be bought elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Twitter is more than just news, though: I wrote last year in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/social-networking-2-0/\">Social Networking 2.0</a> about the rise of private networks that supplemented and, for many use cases, replaced Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/social-networking-2-0/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-4.png?resize=640%2C479&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of v1 vs v2 Social Networks\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5489\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-4.png?resize=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-4.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-4.png?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-4.png?resize=841%2C630&amp;ssl=1 841w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/socialv2-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Twitter, even more than Facebook, remains crucial to this new ecosystem: what WhatsApp group or Telegram chat isn&#8217;t filled with tweets posted for the purpose of discussion or disparagement, or links discovered via Twitter? It is as if these private groups are a fortress on the frontier; Twitter is the wild where you forage for content morsels, and, of course, where you do battle with the enemy.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t underrate that last part: one of the biggest challenges facing would-be Twitter clones is not simply that a complete lack of moderation leads to an overwhelming amount of crap, but also that the sort of person who thrives on Twitter very much wants to know everything that is happening in the world, including amongst those outside of their circle. Being stuck on a text-based social network that only has some of the information to be consumed is lame; having access to anyone and everything, for better or worse, is a value prop that only Twitter can provide.</p>\n<p>This, then, is the other thing that often baffles analysts: Twitter has one of the most powerful moats on the Internet.

At the same time, Twitter is absolutely essential to a core group of users who are not simply unconcerned with the problems inherent to Twitter&#8217;s public broadcast model (including abuse and mob behavior), but actually find the platform indispensable for precisely those reasons: Twitter is where the news is made, shaped, and battled over, and there is very little chance of another platform displacing it, in large part because no one is economically motivated to do so.</p>\n<p>Given this, why not charge for access?</p>\n<p>This may seem obvious to you, but it&#8217;s a huge leap for me; back when Stratechery first started it was fairly popular to argue that social networks should charge users instead of selling ads, which never made sense. I wrote in 2014&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/ello-consumer-friendly-business-models/\">Ello and Consumer-Friendly Business Models</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When it comes to social networks, on the other hand, advertising is clearly the best option: after all, a social network is only as good as the number of friends that are on it, and the best way to get my friends on board is to offer a kick-ass product for free. In other words, the exact opposite of the feature-limited product that Ello is proposing…</p>\n<p>  If…you care about making a successful social network that users will find useful over the long run, then actually build something that is as good as you can possibly make it and incentivize yourself to earn and keep as many users as possible.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I still stand by that analysis generally, but I increasingly question whether or not it applies to Twitter. Twitter has long since penetrated the awareness of just about everyone on earth; the vast majority gave the platform a try and never came back, content to consume the tweets that show up everywhere from news articles to cable news. The core that remains, meanwhile, simultaneously bemoans that Twitter is terrible even as they can&#8217;t rip their eyes away, addicted as they are to that flow of information that is and will for the foreseeable future be unmatched by any other service.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite this impact and indispensability and impenetrable moat, Twitter makes an average of $22.75 per monetizable daily active user per year (and given that some of Twitter&#8217;s most hard core users use third-party Twitter clients, and thus aren&#8217;t monetizable, the revenue per addicted daily active user is even lower). That&#8217;s just under $2/month, an absolutely paltry sum.</p>\n<p>Actually charging for Twitter would, of course, reduce the userbase to some degree; moreover, there are a lot of users with multiple accounts, and plenty of non-human users on Twitter. And, of course, Apple and Google would take their share. Still, even if you cut the userbase by a third to 141 million daily addicted users — which I think vastly overstates Twitter&#8217;s elasticity of demand amongst its core user base — Twitter would only need to charge $4/month (including App Store fees) to exceed the $4.8 billion in revenue it made over the last twelve months.</p>\n<p>And, in fact, that overstates the situation for another reason: only $4.2 billion of Twitter&#8217;s last twelve months of revenue came from ads; the rest came from data licensing and other revenue. There is an alternate world where data licensing is Twitter&#8217;s primary revenue model: just think about how valuable it is to be the primary protocol for real time information sharing, particularly if you can package and distribute that information in an intelligent way?</p>\n<p>Twitter could still do that, and pursue other initiatives like <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2021/build-whats-next-with-the-new-twitter-developer-platform\">its revitalized API</a>, offering developers the opportunity to build entirely new experiences on Twitter&#8217;s information flow (including unmoderated ones). The difference from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/twitter-might/\">the first go-around</a> is that Twitter won&#8217;t have an advertising business to protect, and thus will have its interests much better aligned with developers who can pay for access. After all, that would be Twitter&#8217;s business model.</p>\n<p>I also think this makes Twitter&#8217;s other subscription offerings, like Super Follows, Revue, etc., more attractive, not less; the biggest challenge in running a subscription business is earning that first dollar, but once a user is paying it&#8217;s relatively easy to charge for more.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This could certainly all go horribly wrong; the absolute fastest way to get your users to explore alternatives is to ask them to pay for your service, and there is the matter of acquiring new users, users who can&#8217;t afford to pay, etc. Growth matters, fewer users means less vitality, and I&#8217;m honestly getting cold feet even proposing this! Certainly existing users would howl and insist they were leaving and never coming back. I think, though, that Twitter is so unique, and its userbase is so locked in, that it is the one social networking service that could potentially pull this off.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the fact of the matter is that Twitter has now had one business model and five CEOs (counting Dorsey twice); maybe it&#8217;s worth changing the former before the next activist investor demands yet another change to the latter.</p>\n<p><em>Follow-up: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/why-subscription-twitter-is-a-terrible-idea-twitter-bans-sharing-private-photos-and-videos-twitter-and-free-speech/\">Why Subscription Twitter Is a Terrible Idea</a></em></p>",

Twitter has long since penetrated the awareness of just about everyone on earth; the vast majority gave the platform a try and never came back, content to consume the tweets that show up everywhere from news articles to cable news. The core that remains, meanwhile, simultaneously bemoans that Twitter is terrible even as they can’t rip their eyes away, addicted as they are to that flow of information that is and will for the foreseeable future be unmatched by any other service.\nAnd yet, despite this impact and indispensability and impenetrable moat, Twitter makes an average of $22.75 per monetizable daily active user per year (and given that some of Twitter’s most hard core users use third-party Twitter clients, and thus aren’t monetizable, the revenue per addicted daily active user is even lower). That’s just under $2/month, an absolutely paltry sum.\nActually charging for Twitter would, of course, reduce the userbase to some degree; moreover, there are a lot of users with multiple accounts, and plenty of non-human users on Twitter. And, of course, Apple and Google would take their share. Still, even if you cut the userbase by a third to 141 million daily addicted users — which I think vastly overstates Twitter’s elasticity of demand amongst its core user base — Twitter would only need to charge $4/month (including App Store fees) to exceed the $4.8 billion in revenue it made over the last twelve months.\nAnd, in fact, that overstates the situation for another reason: only $4.2 billion of Twitter’s last twelve months of revenue came from ads; the rest came from data licensing and other revenue. There is an alternate world where data licensing is Twitter’s primary revenue model: just think about how valuable it is to be the primary protocol for real time information sharing, particularly if you can package and distribute that information in an intelligent way?\nTwitter could still do that, and pursue other initiatives like its revitalized API, offering developers the opportunity to build entirely new experiences on Twitter’s information flow (including unmoderated ones). The difference from the first go-around is that Twitter won’t have an advertising business to protect, and thus will have its interests much better aligned with developers who can pay for access. After all, that would be Twitter’s business model.\nI also think this makes Twitter’s other subscription offerings, like Super Follows, Revue, etc., more attractive, not less; the biggest challenge in running a subscription business is earning that first dollar, but once a user is paying it’s relatively easy to charge for more.\n\nThis could certainly all go horribly wrong; the absolute fastest way to get your users to explore alternatives is to ask them to pay for your service, and there is the matter of acquiring new users, users who can’t afford to pay, etc. Growth matters, fewer users means less vitality, and I’m honestly getting cold feet even proposing this! Certainly existing users would howl and insist they were leaving and never coming back. I think, though, that Twitter is so unique, and its userbase is so locked in, that it is the one social networking service that could potentially pull this off.\nMoreover, the fact of the matter is that Twitter has now had one business model and five CEOs (counting Dorsey twice); maybe it’s worth changing the former before the next activist investor demands yet another change to the latter.\nFollow-up: Why Subscription Twitter Is a Terrible Idea",

From <a href=\"https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/peter-jacksons-oral-history-of-weta-digital/\">an oral history of Weta Digital</a>:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-KP1IHnX3-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-KP1IHnX3-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/KP1IHnX3/1-weusedthefilm-1_mp4_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/KP1IHnX3/1-weusedthefilm-1_mp4_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/KP1IHnX3/1-weusedthefilm-1_mp4_dvd.original.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe in the water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it, and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in Heavenly Creatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’d actually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, which was the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. It was a pretty big jump.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Weta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, was integrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson&#8217;s team didn&#8217;t make software to make graphics for Jackson&#8217;s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film that needed graphics to give his team a reason to get started on making software. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotal role in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. The feedback loop between movie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is only possible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramatic improvements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-XlL0DfMQ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-XlL0DfMQ-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/XlL0DfMQ/2-nowthefirstlotr_mp4_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/XlL0DfMQ/2-nowthefirstlotr_mp4_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/XlL0DfMQ/2-nowthefirstlotr_mp4_dvd.original.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which has Gollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completely different to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [That first] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good as we could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but we put a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’t look very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what we had to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really good for the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollum was a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got to the place that we wanted to go.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working on films beyond Jackson&#8217;s personal projects, including <em>Avatar</em> and <em>Avengers</em>. This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capital intensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there is both an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return on the initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the software is used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software development and software application were still integrated, because there was so much more improvement to be had; Jackson again:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-2fsYzYaT-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-2fsYzYaT-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/2fsYzYaT/3-overtheyears-1_mp4_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/2fsYzYaT/3-overtheyears-1_mp4_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/2fsYzYaT/3-overtheyears-1_mp4_dvd.original.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a wide variety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because we keep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a few years ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, that can blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with The Hobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Why can’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the [prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind of code, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of the software, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna do everything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want the Avatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better than last time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole new leaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort of drives me crazy.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>What is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jackson starts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; he says at the end:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-dfR3z7dK-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-dfR3z7dK-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/dfR3z7dK/4-weliveinanage-1_mp4_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/dfR3z7dK/4-weliveinanage-1_mp4_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/dfR3z7dK/4-weliveinanage-1_mp4_dvd.original.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI. There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script, or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’ve simply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know, every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is important because when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking, you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot with a little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get it looking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, and maybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computers that are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing this stuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated from the movie shot to the development process to the software to the individual computer:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-2.png?resize=640%2C439&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Weta&#039;s integration\" width=\"640\" height=\"439\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8057\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-2.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-2.png?resize=1024%2C702&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-2.png?resize=768%2C527&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-2.png?resize=918%2C630&amp;ssl=1 918w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Over the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken off and modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from the software itself; Unity&#8217;s approach of selling tools to the world is the logical endpoint.</p>\n<h4>Unity&#8217;s Modular History</h4>\n<p>When 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines were developed for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software, which was founded in 1991, and id&#8217;s most famous engine was built for its <em>Quake</em> series of games; id&#8217;s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal engine for <em>Unreal Tournament</em>. These were integrated efforts: the engine was built for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once development was completed then the engine was made available to other developers to build their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that id or Epic had already done.</p>\n<p>Unity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of &#8220;democratizing game development&#8221;; the company&#8217;s only game, <em>GooBall</em>, was intended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac, which wasn&#8217;t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business. That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store: that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home on Apple&#8217;s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was off to the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically and mobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds today: 71% of the top 1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion people play games it powers.</p>\n<p>Mobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond its Apple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpowered relative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primary goal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to deliver good enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most of the developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teams and independents; they couldn&#8217;t afford the big PC engines even if they could fit in an iPhone&#8217;s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn&#8217;t just Apple friendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers, both in terms of usability and also pricing.</p>\n<p>Over time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, and as the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilities and performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console and PC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantly in virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity&#8217;s position as a developer&#8217;s partner, not a competitor.</p>\n<h4>Unity&#8217;s Business Model</h4>\n<p>This has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out that mobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or console gaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile, though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size, moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unity found itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile game developers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and make available to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particular requires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own. Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games it supported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely on Unity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money, Unity made money.</p>\n<p>Today it is actually Unity&#8217;s Operate Solutions, including its advertising network and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting and multiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity&#8217;s revenue; Create Solutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity&#8217;s development tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to the former; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity&#8217;s most recent <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/unity-software-inc-u-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/\">earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they&#8217;re just building out their first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook them lots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. They start as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then we get inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then they write bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I would hate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land and expand is like endemic to Unity. It&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re doing.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unity has negative churn because its existing customers increase their spending with Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had a great one in their <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm\">S-1</a>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-1.png?resize=640%2C396&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unity&#039;s S-1 cohort analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8058\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-1.png?w=1076&amp;ssl=1 1076w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-1.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-1.png?resize=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-1.png?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-1.png?resize=1018%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1018w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This shows just how important it is that Unity&#8217;s tools attract customers: the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customers indefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company&#8217;s growth rate is how many new customers it can bring on board.</p>\n<p>Enter Weta.</p>\n<h4>Unity + Weta</h4>\n<p>It is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta and Unity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology, but it&#8217;s only available to Weta; Unity&#8217;s technology, meanwhile, continues to improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on its platform and integration with all of the other components a developer needs to build a business.</p>\n<p>What you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these two paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weta&#8217;s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized and leveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.</li>\n<li>Unity&#8217;s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and only limited by its ability to acquire new customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity&#8217;s market from not just developers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity&#8217;s land-and-expand model. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investment it has made in its software tools.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-3.png?resize=640%2C464&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The convergence of Unity and Weta&#039;s paths\" width=\"640\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8056\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-3.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-3.png?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-3.png?resize=768%2C557&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-3.png?resize=869%2C630&amp;ssl=1 869w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>There is also a third path flowing through this intersection: the convergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes. Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobile market; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers that its developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make things that were never before possible.</p>\n<p>Today, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power, to the benefit of Unity; from Weta&#8217;s perspective, that power makes it possible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve and increasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/unity-buys-weta-digital-an-interview-with-unity-ceo-john-riccitiello/\">in an interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to something that this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use, and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve got thousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at making these tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games, make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, but they can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s the auto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineering construction, or in digital twins.</p>\n<p>  These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to come to an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited about the prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what I would tell you is this is one of those things where you write down the strategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years, and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there are obvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are so different; it is precisely those differences, though, that make this acquisition so compelling.</p>\n<h4>Faceless Platforms</h4>\n<p>One additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is not Epic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC.

      "content_text": "At the beginning of a video announcing Unity’s acquisition of Weta Digital, Peter Jackson, filmmaker extraordinaire and the founder of Weta, and Prem Akkaraju, the CEO of Weta Digital, explained why they were excited to hand Weta Digital over (beyond, of course, the $1.63 billion):\n\n\n  Peter Jackson: We knew that digital effects offered so much possibility for us to be able to create the worlds and the creatures that we were imagining.\n  Prem Akkaraju: Now we’re taking those tools that we have created and are handing them over the Unity to market them for the entire world.\n  Peter Jackson: Together Unity and Weta Digital can create a pathway for any artist in any industry who will now be able to leverage these incredible creative tools.\n\nThe creation, development, and now sale of Weta Digital is a great example of how the ideal approach to innovation in an emerging field changes over time; understanding that journey also explains why Unity is a great home for Weta.\nWeta’s Integrated History\nPeter Jackson has said that he was inspired to start Weta Digital after seeing Jurassic Park and realizing that CGI was the future of movies; the first movie Weta worked on was Heavenly Creature, which Jackson says didn’t even need CGI. From an oral history of Weta Digital:\n\n\n  We used the film as an excuse to buy one computer, just to put our toe in the water. And we had a guy, one guy, who could figure out how to work it, and we got a couple of bits of software, and we did the effects in Heavenly Creatures really just for the sake of doing some CGI effects so we’d actually just start to figure it out. And then on The Frighteners, which was the next movie we [did], we went from one computer to 30 computers. It was a pretty big jump.”\n\nWeta, as you would expect given how nascent computer graphics were, was integrated from top-to-bottom: Jackson’s team didn’t make software to make graphics for Jackson’s films; Jackson actually made a scene in a film that needed graphics to give his team a reason to get started on making software. That bet paid off a few years later when Weta played a pivotal role in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The feedback loop between movie-making and software-development was tight in a way that is only possible with a fully integrated approach, resulting in dramatic improvements from film to film. Jackson said of Gollum:\n\n\n  Now the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, which has Gollum in about two shots, he’s just a little glimpse, and it’s completely different to the Gollum that’s in the next film, The Two Towers. [That first] version of Gollum was pretty gnarly, pretty crude. It was as good as we could do at that time, and we had to have something in the movie, but we put a very deep shadow, and you know that was on purpose because he didn’t look very good. But, nonetheless, we ran out of time, and that was what we had to have in the movie. We still had another year to get him really good for the Two Towers, where he was half the film, so the Two Towers Gollum was a complete overhaul of the one from the first film. It finally got to the place that we wanted to go.”\n\nOver the intervening years, though, Weta gradually branched out, working on films beyond Jackson’s personal projects, including Avatar and Avengers. This too makes sense: developing software is both incredibly capital intensive and benefits from high rates of iteration; that means there is both an economic motive to serve more customers, increasing the return on the initial investment, and a product motive, since every time the software is used there is the potential for improvement. Still, software development and software application were still integrated, because there was so much more improvement to be had; Jackson again:\n\n\n  Over the years, we’ve written about a hundred pieces of code for a wide variety of different things, and it drives me a little bit crazy because we keep writing code for the same things every time. Like, we do Avatar a few years ago, and we wrote software to create grass, and trees, leaves, that can blow with the wind, that sort of stuff. And then I come along with The Hobbit, and I want some grass or some shrubs or some trees, so I [ask], Why can’t we use the stuff that we wrote [already]? I mean it was fine for the [prior] film, but we wanted to be better. I mean there was some kind of code, unspoken code – and it’s not anything to do with the ownership of the software, because it belongs to us – but the guys themselves, wanna do everything better than they did the last time. So they don’t want the Avatar grass, or the leaves; they want to do grass and leaves better than last time. They set about writing a whole new grass software, whole new leaf software, and it happens over and over again, all the time. It sort of drives me crazy.\n\nWhat is interesting, though, is that in that same oral history Jackson starts to signal that the plane of improvement was starting to shift; he says at the end:\n\n\n  We live in in an age where everything is possible, really, with CGI. There’s nothing that you cannot imagine in your head or read on a script, or whatever, that you can’t actually do now. What you’ve got now is you’ve simply got faster – faster and cheaper. In terms of computers, you know, every year they get cheaper, and they get twice as fast. It is important because when you’re doing visual effects, it’s like any form of filmmaking, you often want a take two, take three, take four. You do the fire shot with a little flame once and you know you’re not necessarily gonna get it looking great on the first time, so it’s good to have a second go, and maybe a third go, maybe a fourth go. So when you’ve actually got computers that are getting quicker and faster, it gives you more goes at doing this stuff. Ultimately you get a better looking result.\n\nNotice the transition here; at the beginning everything was integrated from the movie shot to the development process to the software to the individual computer:\n\nOver the ensuing 28 years, though, each of these pieces has been broken off and modularized, increasing the leverage that can be gained from the software itself; Unity’s approach of selling tools to the world is the logical endpoint.\nUnity’s Modular History\nWhen 3D games first became possible in the 1990s 3D game engines were developed for a specific game; the most famous developer was id Software, which was founded in 1991, and id’s most famous engine was built for its Quake series of games; id’s rival was Epic, which built the Unreal engine for Unreal Tournament. These were integrated efforts: the engine was built for the game, and the game was built for the engine; once development was completed then the engine was made available to other developers to build their own games, without having to recreate all of the work that id or Epic had already done.\nUnity, though was different: its founders started with the express goal of “democratizing game development”; the company’s only game, GooBall, was intended as a proof of concept. It also, like Unity, only ran on the Mac, which wasn’t a great recipe for commercial success in the games business. That all flipped in 2008, though, with the opening of the iPhone App Store: that was one of the greatest gold rushes of all time, and a tool at home on Apple’s technologies was particularly well-placed to profit. Unity was off to the races, quickly becoming the most used engine on iOS specifically and mobile gaming broadly, a position it still holds today: 71% of the top 1000 mobile games on the market run on Unity, and over 3 billion people play games it powers.\nMobile was a perfect opportunity for Unity for reasons that went beyond its Apple roots. Phones, particularly back then, were dramatically underpowered relative to PCs with dedicated graphics cards; that meant that the primary goal for an engine was not to produce cutting edge graphics, but to deliver good enough graphics in a power-constrained environment. Moreover, most of the developers taking advantage of the mobile opportunity were small teams and independents; they couldn’t afford the big PC engines even if they could fit in an iPhone’s power envelope. Unity, though, wasn’t just Apple friendly, but also built from the ground-up for independent developers, both in terms of usability and also pricing.\nOver time, as mobile gaming has become the largest part of the market, and as the power of mobile phones has grown, Unity has grown its capabilities and performance; the company has made increasing in-roads into console and PC gaming (albeit mostly with casual games), and has invested significantly in virtual reality. What remains a constant, though, is Unity’s position as a developer’s partner, not a competitor.\nUnity’s Business Model\nThis has opened up further opportunities for Unity: it turned out that mobile gaming had a completely different business model than PC or console gaming as well, which traditionally sold a game for a fixed price. Mobile, though, thanks to its always connected nature and massive market size, moved towards a combination of advertising and in-app purchases. Unity found itself perfectly placed to support both: first, all mobile game developers had the same problem that Unity could solve once and make available to all of its customers, and second, advertising in particular requires far more scale than any one game developer could build on its own. Unity, though, could build an advertising market across all of the games it supported — which again, was most of them — and its customers could rely on Unity knowing that their interests were aligned: if developers made money, Unity made money.\nToday it is actually Unity’s Operate Solutions, including its advertising network and in-app purchase support, plus other services like hosting and multiplayer support, that makes up 65% of Unity’s revenue; Create Solutions, which is primarily monetized via a SaaS-subscription to Unity’s development tools, is only 29%. The latter, though, is an on-ramp to the former; CEO John Riccitiello said on Unity’s most recent earnings call:\n\n  We can hook [creators] at the artist level when they’re just building out their first visual representation of what they want to do. We can hook them lots of different ways. And at Unity, it almost always seems the same. They start as some sort of a experimental customer doing not a lot. And then we get inside and they do a lot more and then they do a lot more, then they write bigger contracts, they start moving more of our services. I would hate to say this in front our customers although they know it, land and expand is like endemic to Unity. It’s exactly what we’re doing.\n\nThis has resulted in a net expansion rate of 142%; that means that Unity has negative churn because its existing customers increase their spending with Unity so substantially. I love a good cohort analysis and Unity had a great one in their S-1:\n\nThis shows just how important it is that Unity’s tools attract customers: the company has the ability to grow revenue from its existing customers indefinitely; the primary limiting factor to the company’s growth rate is how many new customers it can bring on board.\nEnter Weta.\nUnity + Weta\nIt is striking how the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of Weta and Unity are mirror images of each other: Weta has cutting edge technology, but it’s only available to Weta; Unity’s technology, meanwhile, continues to improve, but its biggest asset is the number of developers on its platform and integration with all of the other components a developer needs to build a business.\nWhat you see in this acquisition, then, is the intersection of these two paths:\n\nWeta’s software is increasingly mature and ready to be productized and leveraged across as many customers who wish to use it.\nUnity’s developer offering is increasingly full-featured and only limited by its ability to acquire new customers.\n\nThe logic should be obvious: Weta increases Unity’s market from not just developers but to artists, who can be plugged into Unity’s land-and-expand model. Weta, meanwhile, immediately gains leverage on all of the investment it has made in its software tools.\n\nThere is also a third path flowing through this intersection: the convergence and increase of computing power across devices of all sizes. Unity benefited at the beginning from serving an underpowered mobile market; Weta, in contrast, was so limited by underpowered computers that its developers had to be tightly integrated with artists to make things that were never before possible.\nToday, though, phones and computers are increasingly comparable in power, to the benefit of Unity; from Weta’s perspective, that power makes it possible to use its tools iteratively, lowering the learning curve and increasing the market of artists who can figure them out on their own.\nThat’s why Unity leaped at this opportunity; CEO John Riccitiello told me in an interview:\n\n  It’s an incredible opportunity for the world’s artist to get to something that this incredible collection of tools that they’re going to want to use, and they’re going to want to use it in the film industry. But we’ve got thousands of engineers inside of Unity and we’re going to work at making these tools. Some of them already are real time and usable in video games, make most all of them real time so they can be used in video games, but they can be used in many vertical industry circumstances, whether it’s the auto industry for car configurators or design or architecture, engineering construction, or in digital twins.\n  These tools are pretty darned amazing, I’m proud that we were able to come to an agreement with Peter and the team around him. I’m also excited about the prospect of bringing these tools to a global marketplace…But what I would tell you is this is one of those things where you write down the strategy and then there’s something that accelerates you multiple years, and this is exactly that. We’re thrilled.\n\nIt’s going to take time to see all of this come to fruition, and there are obvious challenges in bringing together two companies that are so different; it is precisely those differences, though, that make this acquisition so compelling.\nFaceless Platforms\nOne additional point: to me the most analogous company to Unity is not Epic, its biggest competitor in the game engine business, but TSMC. TSMC, like Unity, was built from the beginning to be a partner to chip designers, not a competitor, in large part because the company had no other route to market. In the process, though, TSMC democratized chip development and then, with the rise of smartphones, gained the volume necessary to overtake integrated competitors like Intel.\nBy 2019 it was TSMC that was the first to bring chips to market based on Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology; EUV was devilishly difficult and exceptionally expensive, requiring not just years of development by ASML, but also customers like Apple willing to pay for the absolute most cutting edge chips at massive volume. Now TSMC is the most advanced fab in the industry and the 10th most valuable company in the world, and, absent geopolitical risk, a clear winner in a world increasingly experienced via technology.\nThe ultimate manifestation of that is the metaverse, and here Unity is particularly well-placed; Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang at last week’s GTC keynote described today’s web as being 2D, and the future as being 3D, and now Unity owns the best 3D tools in the world. More importantly, unlike Metaverse aspirants like Facebook or Microsoft, Unity isn’t competing for end users, which means it can partner with everyone building those new experiences — including Facebook and Microsoft and Apple — just as TSMC can build chips for everyone, even Intel.\nIt is companies like Unity and TSMC — other examples include Stripe or Shopify or the public clouds — that are the most important to the future. The most valuable prize in technology has always been platforms, but in the beginning era of technology the most important platforms were those that interfaced directly with users; in technology’s middle era the most important platforms will be faceless, empowering developers and artists and creators of all types to create completely new experiences on top of the best technology in the world, created and maintained and improved on by companies that aren’t competing with them, but partnering to achieve the scale necessary to accelerate the future.",

      "content_html": "<p>It&#8217;s certainly the question of the season: what is the Metaverse? I detailed the origin of the term <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/\">in August</a>; that, though, was about Neal Stephenson&#8217;s vision and how it might apply to the future. For the purpose of this Article I am going to focus on my personal definition of the Metaverse, how I think it will come to market, and explain why I think Microsoft is so well placed for this opportunity.</p>\n<p>Here is the punchline: the Metaverse already exists, it just happens to be called the Internet. Consider the seven qualities <a href=\"https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse\">Matthew Ball used to define the Metaverse</a>; the Internet satisfies all of them:<sup id=\"rf1-7997\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/#fn1-7997\" title=\"These bullets points are quoted from Ball&#8217;s list\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Internet is persistent</li>\n<li>The Internet is synchronous and live</li>\n<li>The Internet has no cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of &#8220;presence&#8221;</li>\n<li>The Internet has a fully functioning economy</li>\n<li>The Internet is an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms</li>\n<li>The Internet offers unprecedented (although not perfect) interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, etc.</li>\n<li>The Internet is populated by &#8220;content&#8221; and &#8220;experiences&#8221; created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t see anyone creating some sort of grand nirvana that beats what we currently have on any of these metrics. The entire reason the Internet is as open and interoperable as it is is because it was built in a world without commercial imperative or political oversight; all future efforts will be led by companies seeking profits and regulated by governments seeking control, both of which result in centralization and lock-in. Crypto pushes in the opposite direction, but it is a product of the Internet that relies on many of the qualities in Ball&#8217;s list, not a replacement.</p>\n<p>What makes &#8220;The Metaverse&#8221; unique, then, is that it is the Internet best experienced in virtual reality. This, though, will take time; I expect that the first virtual reality experiences will be individual metaverses, tied together by the Internet as we experience it today.</p>\n<h4>Mobile and the Physical World</h4>\n<p>Forecasts, particularly those that extend multiple years into the future, are always a dangerous enterprise; look no further than January 2020, when I argued in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/\">The End of the Beginning</a> that mobile + cloud represented the culmination of the last fifty years in tech history:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/computingevolution-e1578414248840.png?resize=640%2C527&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The Evolution of Computing\" width=\"640\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4533\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/computingevolution-e1578414248840.png?w=1183&amp;ssl=1 1183w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/computingevolution-e1578414248840.png?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/computingevolution-e1578414248840.png?resize=768%2C632&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/computingevolution-e1578414248840.png?resize=1024%2C843&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/computingevolution-e1578414248840.png?resize=765%2C630&amp;ssl=1 765w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The idea behind this article is right there in the title: &#8220;The End of the Beginning&#8221;. Tech innovation wasn&#8217;t over, it was only beginning, but everything in the future would happen on top of the current paradigm.</p>\n<p>Then COVID happened, and now I&#8217;m not so sure if that&#8217;s the entirety of the story.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the assumption that mobile + cloud is the endpoint is the preeminence of the physical world. After all, what makes the phone the ultimate expression of a &#8220;personal computer&#8221; is that it is with us everywhere, from home to work to every moment in-between. That is what allows for continuous computing everywhere.</p>\n<p>At the same time, for well over a year a huge portion of people&#8217;s lives was primarily digital. The primary way to connect with friends and family was via video calls or social networking; the primary means of entertainment was streaming or gaming; for white collar workers their jobs were online as well. This certainly wasn&#8217;t ideal: the first thing people want to do as the world opens up is see their friends and family in person, go to a movie or see a football game as a collective, or take a trip. Work, though, has been a bit slower to come back: even if the office is open, many meetings are still online given that some of the team may be working remote — for many companies, permanently.</p>\n<p>This last case presents a scenario where the physical is not pre-eminent; an Internet connection is. In this online-only world a phone is certainly essential as a means to stay connected while moving around; it is not, though, the best way to be online. Virtual reality could be.</p>\n<h4>Work in VR</h4>\n<p>There have been two conventional pieces of wisdom about virtual reality that I used to agree with, but now I think both were off-base.</p>\n<p>The first one is that virtual reality&#8217;s first and most important market will be gaming. The reasoning is obvious: gamers already buy dedicated equipment, and gaming is an immersive activity that could justify the hassle of putting on and taking off a headset. One problem, though, is that gamers buying dedicated equipment are going to care the most about performance, and VR quality is still behind; the bigger problem, though, is that there simply isn&#8217;t a big enough market of people with headsets to justify investment from game makers. This is the chicken-and-egg problem that bedevils all new platforms: if you don&#8217;t have users you won&#8217;t have developers, but if you don&#8217;t have developers you won&#8217;t have users.</p>\n<p>The second assumption is that augmented reality would be a larger and more compelling market than virtual reality, just like the phone is a larger and more compelling market than games (excluding mobile games, of course). This is because the phone is with you all of the time — an accompaniment to your daily life — whereas more immersive experiences like console games are a destination: because they require your full attention, they have access to less of your time.</p>\n<p>However, this is why I discussed the COVID-accelerated devaluation of the physical: for decades work was a physical destination; now it is a virtual one. While it used to be that the knowledge worker day was broken up between solitary work on a computer and in-person meetings, over the last two years in-person meetings were transformed into a link on a calendar invite that opened a video-conferencing call.

I now understand what CEO Mark Zuckerberg means when he <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse/\">talks about</a> &#8220;presence&#8221;; there really is a tangible sense of being in the same room as everyone else, and not only in terms of focused discussion: something that is surprisingly familiar is noticing the person next to you not at all paying attention and instead doing email on their computer.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s not an experience that you would want to use all of the time. For one, the tech isn&#8217;t quite good enough; the Quest 2, while a big leap in terms of a standalone device, is still too low resolution and has too limited of battery life to wear for long, and a good number of people still get dizzy after prolonged usage. The bigger problem, though, is that putting on the headset for a call is a bit of a pain; you have to unplug the headset, turn it on, log in, find the Horizon Workrooms app, and join the meeting, and while this only takes a couple of minutes, it&#8217;s just so much easier to click that link on your calendar and join a video call.</p>\n<p>What, though, if you already had the headset on?</p>\n<p>Think again over the last couple of years: most of those people working from home were hunched over a laptop screen; ideally one was able to connect an external monitor, but even that is relatively limited in size and resolution. A future VR headset, though, could contain as many monitors as you could possibly want — or your entire field of view could be one massive monitor. Moreover, the fact that a headset shifts your senses out of your physical environment is actually an advantage if said physical environment has nothing to do with your work.</p>\n<p>In this world joining a meeting does not entail shifting your context from a computer to a headset, but simply clicking a button or entering a virtual door; now all of the advantages of virtual reality — the sense of presence in particular — comes for free. What will seem anachronistic is using a traditional laptop or desktop computer; those, like a headset, keep you stationary, without any of the benefits of virtual reality (of course not everyone will necessarily use a fully contained headset like an Oculus; those with high computing needs would use a headset tethered to their computer).</p>\n<h4>PCs and the Enterprise Market</h4>\n<p>Here is the most important thing: if virtual reality really is better for work, then that solves the chicken-and-egg problem.</p>\n<p>Implicit in assuming that augmented reality is more important than virtual reality is assuming that this new way of accessing the Internet will develop like mobile did. Smartphone makers like Apple, though, had a huge advantage: people already had and wanted mobile phones; selling a device that you were going to carry anyway, but which happened to be infinitely more capable for only a few hundred more dollars, was a recipe for success in the consumer market.</p>\n<p>PCs, though, didn&#8217;t have that advantage: the vast majority of the consumer market had no knowledge of or interest in computers; rather, most people encountered computers for the first time at work. Employers bought their employees computers because computers made them more productive; then, once consumers were used to using computers at work, an ever increasing number of them wanted to buy a computer for their home as well. And, as the number of home computers increased, so did the market opportunity for developers of non-work applications like games.</p>\n<p>I suspect that this is the path that virtual reality will take. Like PCs, the first major use case will be knowledge workers using devices bought for them by their employer, eager to increase collaboration in a remote work world, and as quality increases, offer a superior working environment. Some number of those employees will be interested in using virtual reality for non-work activities as well, increasing the market for non-work applications.</p>\n<p>All of these work applications will, to be clear, still be accessible via regular computers, phones, etc. None of them, though, will be dependent on any one of those devices. Rather these applications will be Internet-first, and thus by definition, Metaverse-first.</p>\n<h4>Microsoft&#8217;s Opportunity</h4>\n<p>This means that the company that is, in my opinion, the most well-placed to capitalize on the Metaverse opportunity is Microsoft. Satya Nadella brought about <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/\">The End of Windows</a> as the linchpin of Microsoft&#8217;s strategy, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that Microsoft abandoned the idea of owning the core application around which a workplace is organized; their <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-slack-social-network/\">online-first device-agnostic cloud operating system is Teams</a>.</p>\n<p>It is a mistake to think of Teams as simply Microsoft&#8217;s rip-off of Slack; while any demo from a Microsoft presentation is obviously an idealized scenario, this snippet from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PraEcNDGSqY&#038;t=8s\">last week&#8217;s Microsoft Ignite keynote</a> shows how much more ambitious Microsoft&#8217;s vision is:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-t0fY2tqy-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-t0fY2tqy-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<p>Microsoft can accomplish this vision with Teams in large part because Microsoft makes so many of the component pieces; this gives the company a powerful selling proposition to businesses around the world whose focus is on their actual business, not on being systems integrators. So many Silicon Valley enterprise companies miss this critical point: they obsess over the user experience of their individual application, without considering how that app fits in the context of a company for whom their app is a means to an end.</p>\n<p>This integration, though, also means that Microsoft has a big head start when it comes to the Metaverse: if the initial experience of the Metaverse is as an individual self-contained metaverse with its own data and applications, then Teams is already there. In other words, not only is enterprise the most obvious channel for virtual reality from a hardware perspective, but Teams is the most obvious manifestation of virtual reality&#8217;s potential from a software perspective (this promotional video is from the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mesh\">Mess for Microsoft Teams webpage</a>):</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-rLAiwRG7-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-rLAiwRG7-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<p>What is not integrated is the hardware; Microsoft sells a number of third party VR headsets on said webpage, all of which have to be connected to a Windows computer. Microsoft&#8217;s success will require creating an opportunity for OEMs similar to the opportunity that was created by the PC. At the same time, this solution is also an advantageous one for the long-term Metaverse-as-Internet vision: Windows is the most open of the consumer platforms, and that applies to Microsoft&#8217;s current implementation of VR. The company would do well to hold onto this approach.</p>\n<h4>Meta&#8217;s Challenge</h4>\n<p>Meta née Facebook is integrated in a different direction: Meta is spending billions of dollars on not just software but also hardware, and while Workrooms is obviously an enterprise application, Meta has to date been very much a consumer company (<a href=\"https://www.workplace.com/\">Workplace</a> notwithstanding). The analogy to the PC era, then, is Apple and the Mac, and that is a reason to be a bit bearish relative to Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Meta, however, has a big advantage that the original Mac did not: the Internet already exists. This is where Workroom&#8217;s integration of your computer into virtual reality is particularly clever: when I am using my computer in virtual reality, I have access to all of my applications, data, etc.; perhaps that, along with Workroom&#8217;s meeting capabilities, will be sufficient.</p>\n<p>Meta, though, should shoot for something more. First off, if I am right, and the enterprise is the first big market for VR, then some of that billions of dollars should go towards building an enterprise go-to-market team that can compete with Microsoft. Second, there remains a huge opportunity long squandered by Google: to be the enterprise platform that competes with Microsoft&#8217;s integrated offering by effectively tying together best-of-breed independent SaaS offerings into a cohesive whole.</p>\n<p>This is, to be honest, probably unrealistic; Meta is starting from scratch in the enterprise space, without any of the identity and email capabilities that Google possesses, much less Microsoft. More importantly, it&#8217;s just very difficult seeing the company having the culture to pull off being an enterprise platform. That, though, places that much more burden on Meta making the best hardware, and keeping its integrated operating system truly open. To that end, it is worth noting that Meta is focused on its headsets being standalone, while Microsoft is still tied to Windows; this gives Meta more freedom-of-movement in terms of working with all of the platforms that already exist.</p>\n<p>What is clear, though, is that Facebook needed to change its name: no one wants to use a consumer social network for work. And, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/meta/\">as I noted in the context of the name change</a>, Meta is still founder-driven. That may give an execution and vision advantage that other companies can&#8217;t match. Again, though, that could mean too much focus on a consumer market that might take longer than Meta hopes to be convinced of why exactly they should buy a VR headset.</p>\n<h4>Apple and AR</h4>\n<p>Apple seems like it should be a strong competitor. The company is clearly the most advanced as far as hardware goes, particularly when it comes to powerful-yet-power-efficient chips, which is a big advantage in a power constrained environment. Moreover, Apple can leverage the fact it controls the phone, just as it does with the Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>However, I am bearish on Apple&#8217;s prospects in this space for three reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, rumors suggest that Apple is focusing on augmented reality, not virtual reality; as I detailed above, though, I think that virtual reality will be the larger market, at least at first.</li>\n<li>Second, Apple&#8217;s iPhone-centricity could be a liability, much as Microsoft&#8217;s Windows-centricity was a liability once mobile came along. It is very hard to fully embrace a new paradigm if the biggest part of your businesses is rooted in another; indeed, the fact that Apple is focused on augmented reality reflects an assumption that the world will continue to be one in which the physical has preeminence over the virtual.</li>\n<li>Third, because both virtual reality and augmented reality will be new-to-the-world interfaces, the importance of developers will likely be more important than in the case of the phone. People bought iPhones first, and developers followed; Apple may have trouble if the chicken-and-egg problem runs in the opposite direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apple Watch is the counter to all of these objections: it&#8217;s a device for the physical world, it benefits from the iPhone, and Apple delivered the core customer propositions — notifications and fitness — on its own. Perhaps a better way to state my position is that Apple is likely well placed for augmented reality, but not virtual reality, but I have changed my mind about which is more important.</p>\n<h4>The Field</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see any other hardware-based startups emerging as VR platforms; I think the best opportunity for a startup is riding on Microsoft&#8217;s coattails and offering an alternative operating system for the hardware that is produced for Windows. Valve is obviously already doing this with Steam, but there may be a place for a more general purpose alternative, probably based on Android (which, I suppose, Google could build, but the company seems awfully content these days).</p>\n<p>Snap and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/john-hanke-niantic-augmented-reality-real-metaverse/\">Niantic</a>, meanwhile, are focused on augmented reality, but will be handicapped by the inability to effectively offload compute onto the phone in the same way Apple will be able to, and again, the trick will be getting consumers to care.</p>\n<p>Roblox, meanwhile, is arguably the Teams of the consumer space: it is a 2D-metaverse that is device-agnostic; the company is working to keep people connected even when they aren&#8217;t playing games, including buying <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/\">Discord competitor Guilded</a>. Discord, meanwhile, is a bit of a metaverse in its own right, with more connections to external applications; this could be a candidate for the aforementioned company that rides on the Microsoft ecosystem&#8217;s coattails.</p>\n<p>Again, though, none of this is so different from the world as it exists today, because the Internet already exists (and yes, that includes crypto). That is one of the things I still stand by from <em>The End of the Beginning</em>: technology doesn&#8217;t move in step changes, but rather evolves on a spectrum towards more continuous computing. Name changes, whether that be from Facebook to Meta or from Internet to Metaverse, are a marker of that evolution, not a punctuated equilibrium.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverse-follow-up-apple-denied-stay-in-epic-case-google-loses-eu-shopping-case-appeal/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-7997\"><p >These bullets points are quoted from Ball&#8217;s list&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/#rf1-7997\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "It’s certainly the question of the season: what is the Metaverse? I detailed the origin of the term in August; that, though, was about Neal Stephenson’s vision and how it might apply to the future. For the purpose of this Article I am going to focus on my personal definition of the Metaverse, how I think it will come to market, and explain why I think Microsoft is so well placed for this opportunity.\nHere is the punchline: the Metaverse already exists, it just happens to be called the Internet. Consider the seven qualities Matthew Ball used to define the Metaverse; the Internet satisfies all of them:1\n\nThe Internet is persistent\nThe Internet is synchronous and live\nThe Internet has no cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”\nThe Internet has a fully functioning economy\nThe Internet is an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms\nThe Internet offers unprecedented (although not perfect) interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, etc.\nThe Internet is populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors\n\nI really don’t see anyone creating some sort of grand nirvana that beats what we currently have on any of these metrics. The entire reason the Internet is as open and interoperable as it is is because it was built in a world without commercial imperative or political oversight; all future efforts will be led by companies seeking profits and regulated by governments seeking control, both of which result in centralization and lock-in. Crypto pushes in the opposite direction, but it is a product of the Internet that relies on many of the qualities in Ball’s list, not a replacement.\nWhat makes “The Metaverse” unique, then, is that it is the Internet best experienced in virtual reality. This, though, will take time; I expect that the first virtual reality experiences will be individual metaverses, tied together by the Internet as we experience it today.\nMobile and the Physical World\nForecasts, particularly those that extend multiple years into the future, are always a dangerous enterprise; look no further than January 2020, when I argued in The End of the Beginning that mobile + cloud represented the culmination of the last fifty years in tech history:\n\nThe idea behind this article is right there in the title: “The End of the Beginning”. Tech innovation wasn’t over, it was only beginning, but everything in the future would happen on top of the current paradigm.\nThen COVID happened, and now I’m not so sure if that’s the entirety of the story.\nImplicit in the assumption that mobile + cloud is the endpoint is the preeminence of the physical world. After all, what makes the phone the ultimate expression of a “personal computer” is that it is with us everywhere, from home to work to every moment in-between. That is what allows for continuous computing everywhere.\nAt the same time, for well over a year a huge portion of people’s lives was primarily digital. The primary way to connect with friends and family was via video calls or social networking; the primary means of entertainment was streaming or gaming; for white collar workers their jobs were online as well. This certainly wasn’t ideal: the first thing people want to do as the world opens up is see their friends and family in person, go to a movie or see a football game as a collective, or take a trip. Work, though, has been a bit slower to come back: even if the office is open, many meetings are still online given that some of the team may be working remote — for many companies, permanently.\nThis last case presents a scenario where the physical is not pre-eminent; an Internet connection is. In this online-only world a phone is certainly essential as a means to stay connected while moving around; it is not, though, the best way to be online. Virtual reality could be.\nWork in VR\nThere have been two conventional pieces of wisdom about virtual reality that I used to agree with, but now I think both were off-base.\nThe first one is that virtual reality’s first and most important market will be gaming. The reasoning is obvious: gamers already buy dedicated equipment, and gaming is an immersive activity that could justify the hassle of putting on and taking off a headset. One problem, though, is that gamers buying dedicated equipment are going to care the most about performance, and VR quality is still behind; the bigger problem, though, is that there simply isn’t a big enough market of people with headsets to justify investment from game makers. This is the chicken-and-egg problem that bedevils all new platforms: if you don’t have users you won’t have developers, but if you don’t have developers you won’t have users.\nThe second assumption is that augmented reality would be a larger and more compelling market than virtual reality, just like the phone is a larger and more compelling market than games (excluding mobile games, of course). This is because the phone is with you all of the time — an accompaniment to your daily life — whereas more immersive experiences like console games are a destination: because they require your full attention, they have access to less of your time.\nHowever, this is why I discussed the COVID-accelerated devaluation of the physical: for decades work was a physical destination; now it is a virtual one. While it used to be that the knowledge worker day was broken up between solitary work on a computer and in-person meetings, over the last two years in-person meetings were transformed into a link on a calendar invite that opened a video-conferencing call. This is the demotion of the physical I referred to above:\n\nMeanwhile, new products like Facebook’s Horizon Workrooms and Microsoft’s Mesh for Microsoft Teams make it possible to hold meetings in virtual reality. While I have not used Microsoft’s offering, one of the things I found compelling about Horizon Workrooms was how it managed mixed reality: not only could you bring your computer into the virtual environment (via a daemon running on your computer that projected the screen into your virtual reality headset), meeting participants without virtual headsets simply appeared on video screens, no different than workers calling in to an in-person meeting in the physical world:\n\nI am very impressed — and my opinion is colored — by the experience of Horizon Workrooms. I now understand what CEO Mark Zuckerberg means when he talks about “presence”; there really is a tangible sense of being in the same room as everyone else, and not only in terms of focused discussion: something that is surprisingly familiar is noticing the person next to you not at all paying attention and instead doing email on their computer.\nAt the same time, it’s not an experience that you would want to use all of the time. For one, the tech isn’t quite good enough; the Quest 2, while a big leap in terms of a standalone device, is still too low resolution and has too limited of battery life to wear for long, and a good number of people still get dizzy after prolonged usage. The bigger problem, though, is that putting on the headset for a call is a bit of a pain; you have to unplug the headset, turn it on, log in, find the Horizon Workrooms app, and join the meeting, and while this only takes a couple of minutes, it’s just so much easier to click that link on your calendar and join a video call.\nWhat, though, if you already had the headset on?\nThink again over the last couple of years: most of those people working from home were hunched over a laptop screen; ideally one was able to connect an external monitor, but even that is relatively limited in size and resolution. A future VR headset, though, could contain as many monitors as you could possibly want — or your entire field of view could be one massive monitor. Moreover, the fact that a headset shifts your senses out of your physical environment is actually an advantage if said physical environment has nothing to do with your work.\nIn this world joining a meeting does not entail shifting your context from a computer to a headset, but simply clicking a button or entering a virtual door; now all of the advantages of virtual reality — the sense of presence in particular — comes for free. What will seem anachronistic is using a traditional laptop or desktop computer; those, like a headset, keep you stationary, without any of the benefits of virtual reality (of course not everyone will necessarily use a fully contained headset like an Oculus; those with high computing needs would use a headset tethered to their computer).\nPCs and the Enterprise Market\nHere is the most important thing: if virtual reality really is better for work, then that solves the chicken-and-egg problem.\nImplicit in assuming that augmented reality is more important than virtual reality is assuming that this new way of accessing the Internet will develop like mobile did. Smartphone makers like Apple, though, had a huge advantage: people already had and wanted mobile phones; selling a device that you were going to carry anyway, but which happened to be infinitely more capable for only a few hundred more dollars, was a recipe for success in the consumer market.\nPCs, though, didn’t have that advantage: the vast majority of the consumer market had no knowledge of or interest in computers; rather, most people encountered computers for the first time at work.

Rather these applications will be Internet-first, and thus by definition, Metaverse-first.\nMicrosoft’s Opportunity\nThis means that the company that is, in my opinion, the most well-placed to capitalize on the Metaverse opportunity is Microsoft. Satya Nadella brought about The End of Windows as the linchpin of Microsoft’s strategy, but that doesn’t mean that Microsoft abandoned the idea of owning the core application around which a workplace is organized; their online-first device-agnostic cloud operating system is Teams.\nIt is a mistake to think of Teams as simply Microsoft’s rip-off of Slack; while any demo from a Microsoft presentation is obviously an idealized scenario, this snippet from last week’s Microsoft Ignite keynote shows how much more ambitious Microsoft’s vision is:\n\nMicrosoft can accomplish this vision with Teams in large part because Microsoft makes so many of the component pieces; this gives the company a powerful selling proposition to businesses around the world whose focus is on their actual business, not on being systems integrators.

Microsoft’s success will require creating an opportunity for OEMs similar to the opportunity that was created by the PC. At the same time, this solution is also an advantageous one for the long-term Metaverse-as-Internet vision: Windows is the most open of the consumer platforms, and that applies to Microsoft’s current implementation of VR. The company would do well to hold onto this approach.\nMeta’s Challenge\nMeta née Facebook is integrated in a different direction: Meta is spending billions of dollars on not just software but also hardware, and while Workrooms is obviously an enterprise application, Meta has to date been very much a consumer company (Workplace notwithstanding). The analogy to the PC era, then, is Apple and the Mac, and that is a reason to be a bit bearish relative to Microsoft.\nMeta, however, has a big advantage that the original Mac did not: the Internet already exists. This is where Workroom’s integration of your computer into virtual reality is particularly clever: when I am using my computer in virtual reality, I have access to all of my applications, data, etc.; perhaps that, along with Workroom’s meeting capabilities, will be sufficient.\nMeta, though, should shoot for something more.

And, as I noted in the context of the name change, Meta is still founder-driven. That may give an execution and vision advantage that other companies can’t match. Again, though, that could mean too much focus on a consumer market that might take longer than Meta hopes to be convinced of why exactly they should buy a VR headset.\nApple and AR\nApple seems like it should be a strong competitor. The company is clearly the most advanced as far as hardware goes, particularly when it comes to powerful-yet-power-efficient chips, which is a big advantage in a power constrained environment. Moreover, Apple can leverage the fact it controls the phone, just as it does with the Apple Watch.\nHowever, I am bearish on Apple’s prospects in this space for three reasons:\n\nFirst, rumors suggest that Apple is focusing on augmented reality, not virtual reality; as I detailed above, though, I think that virtual reality will be the larger market, at least at first.\nSecond, Apple’s iPhone-centricity could be a liability, much as Microsoft’s Windows-centricity was a liability once mobile came along. It is very hard to fully embrace a new paradigm if the biggest part of your businesses is rooted in another; indeed, the fact that Apple is focused on augmented reality reflects an assumption that the world will continue to be one in which the physical has preeminence over the virtual.\nThird, because both virtual reality and augmented reality will be new-to-the-world interfaces, the importance of developers will likely be more important than in the case of the phone. People bought iPhones first, and developers followed; Apple may have trouble if the chicken-and-egg problem runs in the opposite direction.\n\nApple Watch is the counter to all of these objections: it’s a device for the physical world, it benefits from the iPhone, and Apple delivered the core customer propositions — notifications and fitness — on its own. Perhaps a better way to state my position is that Apple is likely well placed for augmented reality, but not virtual reality, but I have changed my mind about which is more important.\nThe Field\nIt’s hard to see any other hardware-based startups emerging as VR platforms; I think the best opportunity for a startup is riding on Microsoft’s coattails and offering an alternative operating system for the hardware that is produced for Windows. Valve is obviously already doing this with Steam, but there may be a place for a more general purpose alternative, probably based on Android (which, I suppose, Google could build, but the company seems awfully content these days).\nSnap and Niantic, meanwhile, are focused on augmented reality, but will be handicapped by the inability to effectively offload compute onto the phone in the same way Apple will be able to, and again, the trick will be getting consumers to care.\nRoblox, meanwhile, is arguably the Teams of the consumer space: it is a 2D-metaverse that is device-agnostic; the company is working to keep people connected even when they aren’t playing games, including buying Discord competitor Guilded. Discord, meanwhile, is a bit of a metaverse in its own right, with more connections to external applications; this could be a candidate for the aforementioned company that rides on the Microsoft ecosystem’s coattails.\nAgain, though, none of this is so different from the world as it exists today, because the Internet already exists (and yes, that includes crypto). That is one of the things I still stand by from The End of the Beginning: technology doesn’t move in step changes, but rather evolves on a spectrum towards more continuous computing. Name changes, whether that be from Facebook to Meta or from Internet to Metaverse, are a marker of that evolution, not a punctuated equilibrium.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.\nThese bullets points are quoted from Ball’s list ↩",

      "content_html": "<p>The obvious analogy to Facebook&#8217;s announcement that it is renaming itself Meta and re-organizing its financials to separate &#8220;Family of Apps&#8221; — Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp — from &#8220;Facebook Reality Labs&#8221; is Google&#8217;s 2015 reorganization to Alphabet, which separated &#8220;Google&#8221;, including the search engine, YouTube, and Google Cloud, from &#8220;Other Bets.&#8221; The headline for investors is just how much Facebook is spending on Reality Labs — $10 billion this year, and that amount is expected to grow — but next quarter&#8217;s financials will also emphasize just how good Facebook&#8217;s core business is; if it plays out like Alphabet, this could be a boon for the stock.</p>\n<p>At the same time, while the mechanics may be similar, it is the differences that suggest the implications of this transformation are much more meaningful. Start with the name: &#8220;Alphabet&#8221; didn&#8217;t really mean anything in particular, and that was the point; Larry Page said <a href=\"https://blog.google/alphabet/google-alphabet/\">in the announcement post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Meta&#8221;, on the other hand, is explicit: CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook is now a metaverse company, and the name reflects that. It is also focused: Alphabet included a host of ventures, many of which had no real connection to Google; Facebook Reality Labs is a collection of efforts, from virtual reality to augmented reality to <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/\">electromyography</a> systems, all in service to a singular vision where instead of looking at the Internet, we live in it.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference, though, is Zuckerberg: while Page and Sergey Brin, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/do-you-trust-larry-page/\">as I wrote at the time</a>, &#8220;may be abandoning day-to-day responsibilities at Google, [they have] no intention of abandoning Google’s profits&#8221; to pursue whatever new initiatives caught their eye, Zuckerberg quite clearly remains fully committed to both the &#8220;Family of Apps&#8221; and &#8220;Reality Labs&#8221;; more than that, Meta is, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse\">as Zuckerberg said in an interview with Stratechery</a>, a continuation of the same vision undergirding Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I think that this is going to unlock a lot of the product experiences that I&#8217;ve wanted to build since even before I started Facebook. From a business perspective, I think that this is going to unlock a massive amount of digital commerce, and strategically I think we&#8217;ll have hopefully an opportunity to shape the development of the next platform in order to make it more amenable to these ways that I think people will naturally want to interact.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another comparison is Microsoft: the Redmond company never changed its name, but under former CEO Steve Ballmer it might as well have been called the Windows company; that&#8217;s how you ended up with names like Windows Azure, a misnomer born of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/services-not-devices/\">a misguided strategy</a> that sought to leverage Microsoft&#8217;s thriving productivity business and burgeoning cloud offering to prop up the product that had made the company rich, famous, and powerful. Zuckerberg made a similar mistake last year, <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/\">forcing Oculus users to login with their Facebook account</a>, which not only upset Oculus users but also handcuffed products like Horizon Workrooms, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/enterprise-metaverses-horizon-workrooms-workrooms-facebook-problem/\">Facebook&#8217;s VR solution for business meetings</a>.</p>\n<p>Satya Nadella&#8217;s great triumph as CEO of Microsoft was <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/\">breaking Windows hold over the company</a>, freeing the company to not just emphasize Azure&#8217;s general purpose cloud offerings, but to also <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-slack-social-network/\">build a new OS centered on Teams</a> that was Internet-centric, and device agnostic. Indeed, that is why I don&#8217;t scoff at Nadella&#8217;s invocation of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/\">the enterprise metaverse</a>; sure, Microsoft has the HoloLens, but that is just one way to access a work environment that exists somewhere beyond any one device or any one app.</p>\n<p>Meta seems like Zuckerberg&#8217;s opportunity to make the same break: Facebook benefited from being <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/mobile-makes-facebook-just-an-app-thats-great-news/\">just an app</a> (until <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/\">it didn&#8217;t</a>), but until today Facebook was also the company, and as long as that was the case the metaverse vision was going to be fundamentally constrained by what already exists.</p>\n<p>There is a third comparison, though, and that is Apple generally, and Steve Jobs specifically. While Jobs&#8217; tenure in retrospect looks like a string of new innovative products after new innovative products, from the Mac to the iPhone, the latter was in many respects Jobs&#8217; opportunity to truly deliver on the vision he had for the former. The Mac was a computer built for end users, but it launched in an era dominated by enterprises; that is why it was initially a failure from a business perspective, which helped drive Jobs out of the company he had founded. Fast forward 23 years and the iPhone launched in an era where end users dominated the market; it was enterprise players like Microsoft that scrambled, and failed, to catch up.</p>\n<p>The analogy to Facebook is the company&#8217;s failure to build a phone; the company&#8217;s biggest problem is that it was simply too late — iPhone and Android were already firmly established by the 2013 launch of the Facebook First phone and Facebook Home Android launcher — but I also thought that Zuckerberg&#8217;s conception of what a phone should be was fundamentally flawed. One of the very first articles on Stratechery was <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/apps-people-jobs-to-be-done/\">Apps, People, and Jobs to Be Done</a>, where I took issue with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2013/04/facebookqa/\">Zuckerberg&#8217;s argument</a> that people, not apps, should be the organizing principle for mobile; I concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apps aren’t the center of the world. But neither are people. The reason why smartphones rule the world is because they do more jobs for more people in more places than anything in the history of mankind. Facebook Home makes jobs harder to do, in effect demoting them to the folders on my third screen [in favor of social].\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have long assumed that augmented reality would be a bigger opportunity than virtual reality precisely because <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/ces-2016/\">augmented reality fits in the same lane as the smartphone</a>; I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-problem-with-virtual-reality/\">The Problem with Facebook and Virtual Reality</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  That is the first challenge of virtual reality: it is a destination, both in terms of a place you go virtually, but also, critically, the end result of deliberative actions in the real world. One doesn’t experience virtual reality by accident: it is a choice, and often — like in the case of my PlayStation VR — a rather complicated one.</p>\n<p>  That is not necessarily a problem: going to see a movie is a choice, as is playing a video game on a console or PC. Both are very legitimate ways to make money: global box office revenue in 2017 was $40.6 billion U.S., and billions more were made on all the other distribution channels in a movie’s typical release window; video games have long since been an even bigger deal, generating $109 billion globally last year.</p>\n<p>  Still, that is an order of magnitude less than the amount of revenue generated by something like smartphones. Apple, for example, sold $158 billion worth of iPhones over the last year; the entire industry was worth around $478.7 billion in 2017. The disparity should not come as a surprise: unlike movies or video games, smartphones are an accompaniment on your way to a destination, not a destination in and of themselves.</p>\n<p>  That may seem counterintuitive at first: isn’t it a good thing to be the center of one’s attention? That center, though, can only ever be occupied by one thing, and the addressable market is constrained by time. Assume eight hours for sleep, eight for work, a couple of hours for, you know, actually navigating life, and that leaves at best six hours to fight for. That is why devices intended to augment life, not replace it, have always been more compelling: every moment one is awake is worth addressing.</p>\n<p>  In other words, the virtual reality market is fundamentally constrained by its very nature: because it is about the temporary exit from real life, not the addition to it, there simply isn’t nearly as much room for virtual reality as there is for any number of other tech products.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meta&#8217;s vision, to be clear, is that one ought to be able to access the metaverse from anywhere, including your phone, computer, AR glasses, and of course a VR headset. What is worth considering, though, are the ways in which the technological revolution <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/sequoia-productive-capital/\">I wrote about yesterday</a> are changing society; I think that the term &#8220;working from home&#8221;, for example, is another misnomer: for some number of people work is virtual, which means it can be done from anywhere — your home is just one of many options. And in that case, an escape from physical reality is actually the goal, not a burden; why wouldn&#8217;t the same attraction exist in terms of social interactions generally, particularly as more and more communities exist only on the Internet?</p>\n<p>Here Facebook the app was again a limitation: the product digitized offline relationships, which is why it grew so quickly; many of the challenges that have placed Zuckerberg in the hot seat currently stem from grafting on purely digital interactions and relationships to a product that was always more reality-rooted than its competitors. The metaverse, though, by its very definition is rooted in the digital world, and if the primary driver is to interact with people virtually, whether that be for work or for play, then Zuckerberg&#8217;s people-centric organizing principle — like Apple&#8217;s focus on the end-user — may be a viewpoint that was originally too early, and then right on time.</p>\n<p>This is all about as favorable a spin as you can put on Meta, of course; there is a lot of grumbling from investors this week about the effect the effort is having on Facebook&#8217;s margins, and my previously-voiced suspicion that Zuckerberg just wants to own a platform very much lines up with Facebook currently feeling the pain from its Apple-dependency in particular. And, needless to say, Facebook is dealing with plenty of other issues in the media and Washington D.C. that not only concern the &#8220;Family of Apps&#8221;, but also threaten the reception of whatever it is that &#8220;Reality Labs&#8221; ultimately produces.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg, though, is a founder, which both means he decides, thanks to his super-voting shares, and also that he has the credibility to pull investors along; more than that, though, is the clear founder ethos that Zuckerberg is bringing to Meta. Zuckerberg told me:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  One of the things that I&#8217;ve found in building the company so far is that you can&#8217;t reduce everything to a business case upfront. I think a lot of times the biggest opportunity is you kind of just need to care about them and think that something is going to be awesome and have some conviction and build it. One of the things that I&#8217;ve been surprised about a number of times in my career is when something that seemed really obvious to me and that I expected clearly someone else is going to go build this thing, that they just don&#8217;t. I think a lot of times things that seem like they&#8217;re obvious that they should be invested in by someone, it just doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>\n<p>  I care about this existing, not just virtual and augmented reality existing, but it getting built out in a way that really advances the state of human connection and enables people to be able to interact in a different way. That&#8217;s sort of what I&#8217;ve dedicated my life&#8217;s work to. I&#8217;m not sure, I don&#8217;t know that if we weren&#8217;t investing so much in this, that would happen or that it would happen as quickly, or that it would happen in the same way. I think that we are going to kind shift the direction of that.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meta exists because Zuckerberg believes it needs to exist, and he is devoted to making the metaverse a reality; it&#8217;s his call, for better or worse. In that it reminds me of an increasingly popular phrase on FinTwit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=house%20of%20zuck&#038;src=typed_query\">House of Zuck</a>. It has been adopted by a set of investors that are eternally bullish on Facebook not because of its results per se, but because of their conviction that those results come from Zuckerberg&#8217;s leadership. It is a belief that is being tested as never before.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Day 1 stock needs Day 1 investors, Day 2 folks may now leave</p>\n<p>&mdash; East (@east_cap) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/east_cap/status/1453076148066394115?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>Facebook has always been unique amongst the Big 5 tech companies because it is the one company <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/regulators-and-reality/\">that does not have a monopoly-like moat in the market in which it competes</a>; today it is also unique in that it is the only one of the five that is still founder-led. I don&#8217;t think that is a coincidence.</p>\n<p>The fact that Facebook is uniquely held responsible for the societal problems engendered by the Internet does, I suspect, stem from the fact that Zuckerberg is an obvious target. How many people concerned about anti-vax rhetoric, for example, can even name the person in charge of YouTube, a far more potent vector? Page and Brin were wise to step aside once Google was established, to make Google a less tempting target; the same with Jeff Bezos. Facebook doesn’t have that luxury. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/opinion/zuckerberg-facebook-ceo.html\">Kara Swisher made explicit</a> what seems obvious: the way for Facebook to escape its current predicament is for Zuckerberg to hand the reins to someone else.

Zuckerberg doesn&#8217;t have the luxury of a decade in the wilderness, but he has certainly undergone a trial by fire; Meta&#8217;s ultimate success, or lack thereof, will answer the question if that is enough.</p>\n<p><em>You can read an interview I conducted with Zuckerberg about Facebook&#8217;s plan for the metaverse <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse\">here</a>.</em></p>",

I’m not sure, I don’t know that if we weren’t investing so much in this, that would happen or that it would happen as quickly, or that it would happen in the same way. I think that we are going to kind shift the direction of that.\n\nMeta exists because Zuckerberg believes it needs to exist, and he is devoted to making the metaverse a reality; it’s his call, for better or worse. In that it reminds me of an increasingly popular phrase on FinTwit: House of Zuck. It has been adopted by a set of investors that are eternally bullish on Facebook not because of its results per se, but because of their conviction that those results come from Zuckerberg’s leadership. It is a belief that is being tested as never before.\n\n\nDay 1 stock needs Day 1 investors, Day 2 folks may now leave\n— East (@east_cap) October 26, 2021\n \nFacebook has always been unique amongst the Big 5 tech companies because it is the one company that does not have a monopoly-like moat in the market in which it competes; today it is also unique in that it is the only one of the five that is still founder-led. I don’t think that is a coincidence.\nThe fact that Facebook is uniquely held responsible for the societal problems engendered by the Internet does, I suspect, stem from the fact that Zuckerberg is an obvious target. How many people concerned about anti-vax rhetoric, for example, can even name the person in charge of YouTube, a far more potent vector? Page and Brin were wise to step aside once Google was established, to make Google a less tempting target; the same with Jeff Bezos. Facebook doesn’t have that luxury. Kara Swisher made explicit what seems obvious: the way for Facebook to escape its current predicament is for Zuckerberg to hand the reins to someone else. Only a founder, though, can admit, as Zuckerberg did on Facebook’s recent earnings call, that the company is losing ground with young people, and not just pivot the “Family of Apps”, but the entire company towards a future vision that establishes Meta as a dominant platform in its own right.\nThat’s also why I considered titling this article “House of Zuck”; that, more than ever, is what Meta née Facebook is. Today’s Facebook Connect keynote is entirely about a future that doesn’t yet exist; believing that it will happen rests on the degree to which you believe that Zuckerberg the founder can accomplish more than any mere manager.\nThis is where I come back to Jobs: it’s hard to remember now, but the Apple founder had some very rough edges; his exile from Apple was terrible for the company, but good for Jobs’ maturation into an executive with a founder’s vision and drive that could bring Apple to greater heights than ever before. Zuckerberg doesn’t have the luxury of a decade in the wilderness, but he has certainly undergone a trial by fire; Meta’s ultimate success, or lack thereof, will answer the question if that is enough.\nYou can read an interview I conducted with Zuckerberg about Facebook’s plan for the metaverse here.",

In this view the personal computer/on-premises server era was simply a stepping stone between two ends of a clearly defined range.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s arguable that concepts like <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/\">metaverses</a> represent one final step down this path, and the final unification of the cloud and interaction; I don&#8217;t think that means we aren&#8217;t in the deployment period technologically speaking though: continuous computing is here (even if it might become even more immersive).</p>\n<p><strong>Techno-Economic Paradigm</strong></p>\n<p>In line with the nature of continuous computing, the techno-economic paradigm is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/\">Everything as a Service</a>, a concept I wrote about in 2016:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Services sound a lot like software: both are intangible, both scale infinitely, and both are infinitely customizable. It follows that a services business model — payment in exchange for service rendered, without the transfer of ownership — is a much more natural fit for software than the transaction model characteristic of manufacturing. It better matches value generated and value received — customers only pay if they use it, and producers are rewarded for making their product indispensable — and more efficiently allocates fixed costs: occasional users may be charged nothing at all, while regular users who find your software differentiated pay more than the marginal cost of providing it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The services business model is obviously dominant in terms of software: all new software companies are SaaS companies, and old-line companies like Microsoft and Adobe have long since transformed their licensing-based business models to the SaaS business model. All of these businesses make huge investments in fixed costs (building the software), and reach profitability by leveraging the zero marginal cost nature of software and the Internet to scale as large as possible as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, all of these new companies operating with a SaaS model themselves depend on public clouds like AWS, which has the exact same model, just at even larger scale: gargantuan investments in fixed costs, made profitable by leveraging the zero marginal cost nature of software and the Internet to scale as large as possible as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just an enterprise story, though: huge consumer platforms like Facebook or Netflix are themselves services, operated on the same business model of massive investments in fixed costs, scaled via the zero marginal cost nature of the Internet. Of course the monetization may differ: Netflix charges a subscription, which aligns payment (continuous) with the delivery of value (continuous). Facebook monetizes via ads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of these ads are for subscription-based services</li>\n<li>Some of these ads are for other digital businesses like games based on the same economic principles</li>\n<li>Some of these ads are for e-commerce</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E-commerce might seem like an exception to the services narrative, but while you do get to keep the goods that are delivered, everything about how e-commerce functions is as a service. Shopify has made huge investments in fixed costs to provide a selling platform for goods that are stored in rented space in 3PL warehouses and delivered by companies like Fedex for a fee, which is another way of saying payment for services.</p>\n<p>Here again Amazon is the ultimate example of this model: the company has made massive investments in everything from its online store to its distribution centers to even its own planes and delivery vehicles, and an ever-increasing share of its e-commerce revenue comes from merchants effectively renting access to the entire stack; merchants are still selling goods, and consumers are still receiving them, but everything in the middle is a software-driven service with a software-derived business model.</p>\n<p>Local services are being impacted as well: Uber, Doordash, Instacart, etc. are only possible in a world of massive compute capacity and ubiquitous smartphones; this enables customers to order cars or food from anywhere, and drivers or delivery workers to know where to go and what to bring. This goes hand-in-hand with the COVID-driven rise in remote work: yes, only a portion of society has the luxury to work from anywhere (probably because they work in a digital services industry), but what is notable is the transformation of manual labor, from Amazon warehouses to Doordash delivery drivers, that has arisen to serve their needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Socio-Institutional Framework</strong></p>\n<p>This was the primary focus of my previous Article. Perez has long been puzzled by the seeming lack of response by governments to the new technological paradigm; I think that response is coming into sharp focus, but it is easily missed because it is rather dystopian:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What is worth noting, though, is that you can make the case that China has entered the Synergy phase in which government has aligned with technology to profoundly impact China’s citizens. That this entails mass surveillance, censorship, and propaganda doesn’t undo Perez’s thesis; it perhaps punctures her optimism.</p>\n<p>  There are signs a weaker, yet in some ways similar, form of synergy has happened in the U.S. as well; soon after the Dotcom Bubble came the Patriot Act, and while the political motivations were the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the implementation was very much about leveraging technology for government ends. The extent of this synergy only became clear in 2013 when the Snowden revelations exposed a vast web of surveillance conducted by tech and telecommunications companies in partnership with the NSA.</p>\n<p>  Then, over the last several years, there has been a concerted effort to push tech companies to increasingly limit misinformation on their networks, and post corrective information instead; it doesn’t take much squinting to re-label both efforts as censorship and propaganda. This is not, I would note, to pass judgment as to whether those efforts are right or wrong (although I am skeptical); merely to note that there may be more evidence of synergy between the government and tech than it seems. It’s all a bit dystopian, to be sure, but revolutions by their nature are unpredictable; it wasn’t a certainty that liberal democracy would triumph in the fourth revolution, much less the current one.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is also an argument to be made that the dramatic shift in monetary policy over the last 13 years — prompted by the Great Recession, but interestingly enough perfectly aligned with the smartphone era — is itself evidence of synergy: tech is inherently deflationary, which could be balancing out the inflationary potential of printing new money. This, needless to say, is a very complex topic, which is why I didn&#8217;t include it in my previous article; consider this paragraph as a point of speculation.</p>\n<h4>Financial Capital and Production Capital</h4>\n<p>One of the most important principles in Perez&#8217;s model is the difference between Financial Capital and Production Capital and the roles they play in the Installation period versus the Deployment period (just look at the name of the book!). Perez explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Financial capital is mobile by nature while production capital is basically tied to concrete products, both by installed equipment with specific operational capabilities and by linkages in networks of suppliers, customers or distributors in particular geographic locations. Financial capital can successfully invest in a firm or a project without much knowledge of what it does or how it does it. Its main question is potential profitability (sometimes even just the perception others may have about it). For production capital, knowledge about product, process and markets is the very foundation of potential success. The knowledge can be scientific and technical expertise or managerial experience, it can be innovative talent or entrepreneurial drive, but it will always be about specific areas and only partly mobile…</p>\n<p>  All these distinctions lead to a fundamental difference in level of commitment. Financial capital is footloose by nature; production capital has roots in an area of competence and even in a geographic region. Financial capital will flee danger; production capital has to face every storm by holding fast, ducking down or innovating its way forward or sideways. Yet, though the notion of progress and innovation is associated with production capital – and rightly so – ironically when it comes to radical change, incumbent production capital can become conservative and then it is the role of financial capital (whether from family, banks or ‘angels’) to enable the rise of the new entrepreneurs.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Financial capital is critical in the Installation period of a technological revolution. Because it is mobile and seeking a return it flows to new technologies that are just emerging; in the case of the current era that meant chips, then software, then services. Financial capital is also highly speculative, and provokes a frenzy that leads to a bubble, which is exactly what happened in the Dot Com era.</p>\n<p>Production capital, on the other hand, is harvested from profitable businesses that re-invest their earnings to improve their products and expand their markets during the Deployment period. This has clearly been happening with the largest tech companies: one of the best investments one could have made over the last decade would have been stock in Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, not because they needed investor capital, but because they were so generating such exceptional returns from reinvesting their own profits.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the fact that the big 5 tech companies were so clearly powered by production capital is one of the reasons why I have always been skeptical that we are still stuck in the Turning Point; at the same time, it is not as if the venture capital industry had disappeared.</p>\n<h4>Financial Capital = Venture Capital</h4>\n<p>Venture capital is another name for Financial capital; Perez writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  As far as truly new ventures are concerned, innovators may have brilliant ideas for which they are willing to take huge risks, devoting their whole lives to bringing their projects to reality, but if finance is not forthcoming they can do nothing.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is how I described venture capital in 2015&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/venture-capital-and-the-internets-impact/\">Venture Capital and the Internet’s Impact</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the case of startups, during the 45 years after Arthur Rock founded the first venture capital partnership in 1961, the vast majority of new firms needed significant funding from day one. Hardware startups of course needed specialized equipment, the funds to make prototypes, and then to set up actual manufacturing lines, but software startups, particularly those with any sort of online component, also needed to make significant hardware investments into servers, software that ran on said servers, and a staff to manage them. This was where the venture capitalists’ unique skill-set came into play: they identified the startups worthy of funding through little more than a PowerPoint and a person, and brought to bear the level of upfront capital necessary to make that startup a reality.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The point of that article, however, was to explain how AWS — a service — was transforming venture capital; now new products could be built in someone&#8217;s bedroom, leading to the rise of angels writing much smaller checks to much smaller teams achieving much larger impact much more quickly than ever before. This made a venture capitalist&#8217;s job easier in the short term — now they were writing checks based on existing products and growth metrics, instead of PowerPoints — but in the long run it meant that venture capital was becoming commoditized.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The story doesn’t end there: the trouble for venture capitalists is that they are getting squeezed from the top of the funding hierarchy as well: a new class of growth investors, many of them made up of traditional limited partners like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, are approaching unicorn companies on a portfolio basis…Sure, this is relatively dumb money, but that’s where those angel and incubator relationships come in: if startups increasingly feel they have the relationships and advice they need, then growth funding is basically a commodity, so why not take dumb cheap money sooner rather than later?</p>\n<p>  Interestingly, just as in every other commodity market, the greatest defense for venture capitalists turns out to be brand: firms like Benchmark, Sequoia, or Andreessen Horowitz can buy into firms at superior prices because it matters to the startup to have them on their cap table. Moreover, Andreessen Horowitz in particular has been very open about their goal to offer startups far more than money, including dedicated recruiting teams, marketing teams, and probably most usefully an active business development team. Expect the venture capitalist return power curve to grow even steeper.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Brand, though, can only resist commoditization for so long; a16z in particular has dramatically accelerated its growth, and now the most famous brand name of all is going even further.</p>\n<h4>Sequoia&#8217;s Transformation</h4>\n<p>Sequoia Partner Roelof Botha wrote yesterday on <a href=\"https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-sequoia-fund-patient-capital-for-building-enduring-companies-9ed7bcd6c7da\">Medium</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Innovations in venture capital haven’t kept pace with the companies we serve. Our industry is still beholden to a rigid 10-year fund cycle pioneered in the 1970s. As chips shrank and software flew to the cloud, venture capital kept operating on the business equivalent of floppy disks. Once upon a time the 10-year fund cycle made sense. But the assumptions it’s based on no longer hold true, curtailing meaningful relationships prematurely and misaligning companies and their investment partners. The best founders want to make a lasting impact in the world. Their ambition isn’t confined to a 10-year period. Neither is ours…</p>\n<p>  Today, we are excited to announce our boldest innovation yet to help founders build enduring companies for the 21st century. In our U.S./Europe business, we are breaking with the traditional organization based on fund cycles and restructuring Sequoia Capital around a singular, permanent structure: The Sequoia Fund.</p>\n<p>  Moving forward, our LPs will invest into The Sequoia Fund, an open-ended liquid portfolio made up of public positions in a selection of our enduring companies. The Sequoia Fund will in turn allocate capital to a series of closed-end sub funds for venture investments at every stage from inception to IPO. Proceeds from these venture investments will flow back into The Sequoia Fund in a continuous feedback loop. Investments will no longer have “expiration dates.” Our sole focus will be to grow value for our companies and limited partners over the long run.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This announcement, in Perez terms, is as clear as could be: Sequoia is transforming itself from financial capital to production capital. Instead of LP&#8217;s investing in funds that make speculative investments in risky endeavors, Sequoia wants to keep long-term positions in companies that have proven business models and are embarking on the decade (or longer) process of improving their products and expanding their markets to the entire world.</p>\n<p>This also, I suspect, represents the formation of a sort of &#8220;Silicon Valley Inc.&#8221;; while the big 5 can entirely self-fund, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/daily-update-box-updates-s-1-look-great-instagram-passes-300-million-microsoft-acquires-hockeyapp/\">the nature of the SaaS business model</a> is such that companies with proven product-market fit are better off losing more money up-front rather than less:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers, once acquired, are like annuities that make money years into the future, but the cost to acquire them has to be paid up front.</li>\n<li>The core software product represents a huge fixed cost investment that is leveraged by scaling to as many customers as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The combination of these two factors means that SaaS companies take longer to self-fund, even if their models are proven; what Sequoia can do with their model is invest in an entire portfolio of these companies and hold onto them indefinitely, effectively recycling money from mature companies into nascent ones, much as Apple or Microsoft invests profits from their current products into the development of new ones. On an individual company level it looks like venture/financial capital; as a collective it is much more akin to production capital, especially once you realize that many of these companies, thanks to angels and AWS, are already fairly de-risked.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while Sequoia&#8217;s announcement feels so momentous because of their long history in the Valley, institutions like Tiger Capital are already playing the exact same game; the era of production capital is firmly upon us, which means we are clearly in the Deployment period of Perez&#8217;s model.</p>\n<h4>Growth and Crypto</h4>\n<p>In Perez&#8217;s model the Growth element in the Deployment period means &#8220;converging growth of most industries using [the new] paradigm&#8221;; that seems inconsistent with a reality where tech continues to provide a huge amount of growth relative to the rest of the economy.</p>\n<p>I think, though, that is a problem of definition: we still have a habit of calling everything that runs on a SaaS model a tech company, even if the actual industry or service being rendered isn&#8217;t about tech at all. Is Warby Parker a tech company? Is Carvana? Is DoorDash? The list goes on-and-on: new companies are created using technology, but of course they are! Calling everything a tech company is like calling a shopping mall a car company; sure, it was enabled by and undergirded by the automobile, but what in that era wasn&#8217;t? To return to <em>The End of the Beginning</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Indeed, this is exactly what we see in consumer startups in particular: few companies are pure “tech” companies seeking to disrupt the dominant cloud and mobile players; rather, they take their presence as an assumption, and seek to transform society in ways that were previously impossible when computing was a destination, not a given. That is exactly what happened with the automobile: its existence stopped being interesting in its own right, while the implications of its existence changed everything.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That leaves the question of crypto; given its oppositional nature to the current paradigm — decentralization, encryption, and ownership — it is clearly something completely new; moreover, the capital chasing returns in crypto is clearly financial capital, not production capital.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s certainly possible for a new paradigm to emerge alongside an existing paradigm; Perez notes on multiple instances her model is stylized, and details multiple periods of overlap. What is notable, though, is that crypto draws talent from the same pool that drives the IT revolution, and it&#8217;s unclear what the impact of this drain will be on the current paradigm. The optimistic take is that the shift to remote work will dramatically increase the available talent pool to tech-companies-that-are-actually-just-companies, and it&#8217;s one I share: the opportunity now is in new markets, not new tech, and open source software, along with public clouds, provides a strong foundation for any new company.</p>\n<p>That suggests that crypto will continue to exist in a bit of a parallel universe, which makes sense; it already has its own currencies, after all. That is another way of saying I think that crypto is still very early in its lifecycle; 2017 wasn&#8217;t the big crash, nor will the next one be — remember that tech had its own internal boom-and-bust cycles in the three decades between the introduction of the Intel processor and the Dotcom bubble. Nor is this a bearish take: those three decades were exceptionally profitable for everyone involved — including Sequoia, which was founded in 1972. Perhaps its successor, the one that shifts to providing productive capital for crypto companies decades from now, has already been born.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-7907\"><p >Do read that piece first, if you haven&#8217;t, and <a href=\"http://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html\">Jerry Neumann&#8217;s overview of Perez&#8217;s theory</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/sequoia-productive-capital/#rf1-7907\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",

It better matches value generated and value received — customers only pay if they use it, and producers are rewarded for making their product indispensable — and more efficiently allocates fixed costs: occasional users may be charged nothing at all, while regular users who find your software differentiated pay more than the marginal cost of providing it.\n\nThe services business model is obviously dominant in terms of software: all new software companies are SaaS companies, and old-line companies like Microsoft and Adobe have long since transformed their licensing-based business models to the SaaS business model. All of these businesses make huge investments in fixed costs (building the software), and reach profitability by leveraging the zero marginal cost nature of software and the Internet to scale as large as possible as quickly as possible.\nMeanwhile, all of these new companies operating with a SaaS model themselves depend on public clouds like AWS, which has the exact same model, just at even larger scale: gargantuan investments in fixed costs, made profitable by leveraging the zero marginal cost nature of software and the Internet to scale as large as possible as quickly as possible.\nThis isn’t just an enterprise story, though: huge consumer platforms like Facebook or Netflix are themselves services, operated on the same business model of massive investments in fixed costs, scaled via the zero marginal cost nature of the Internet. Of course the monetization may differ: Netflix charges a subscription, which aligns payment (continuous) with the delivery of value (continuous). Facebook monetizes via ads:\n\nSome of these ads are for subscription-based services\nSome of these ads are for other digital businesses like games based on the same economic principles\nSome of these ads are for e-commerce\n\nE-commerce might seem like an exception to the services narrative, but while you do get to keep the goods that are delivered, everything about how e-commerce functions is as a service. Shopify has made huge investments in fixed costs to provide a selling platform for goods that are stored in rented space in 3PL warehouses and delivered by companies like Fedex for a fee, which is another way of saying payment for services.\nHere again Amazon is the ultimate example of this model: the company has made massive investments in everything from its online store to its distribution centers to even its own planes and delivery vehicles, and an ever-increasing share of its e-commerce revenue comes from merchants effectively renting access to the entire stack; merchants are still selling goods, and consumers are still receiving them, but everything in the middle is a software-driven service with a software-derived business model.\nLocal services are being impacted as well: Uber, Doordash, Instacart, etc. are only possible in a world of massive compute capacity and ubiquitous smartphones; this enables customers to order cars or food from anywhere, and drivers or delivery workers to know where to go and what to bring. This goes hand-in-hand with the COVID-driven rise in remote work: yes, only a portion of society has the luxury to work from anywhere (probably because they work in a digital services industry), but what is notable is the transformation of manual labor, from Amazon warehouses to Doordash delivery drivers, that has arisen to serve their needs.\nSocio-Institutional Framework\nThis was the primary focus of my previous Article. Perez has long been puzzled by the seeming lack of response by governments to the new technological paradigm; I think that response is coming into sharp focus, but it is easily missed because it is rather dystopian:\n\n  What is worth noting, though, is that you can make the case that China has entered the Synergy phase in which government has aligned with technology to profoundly impact China’s citizens. That this entails mass surveillance, censorship, and propaganda doesn’t undo Perez’s thesis; it perhaps punctures her optimism.\n  There are signs a weaker, yet in some ways similar, form of synergy has happened in the U.S. as well; soon after the Dotcom Bubble came the Patriot Act, and while the political motivations were the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the implementation was very much about leveraging technology for government ends. The extent of this synergy only became clear in 2013 when the Snowden revelations exposed a vast web of surveillance conducted by tech and telecommunications companies in partnership with the NSA.\n  Then, over the last several years, there has been a concerted effort to push tech companies to increasingly limit misinformation on their networks, and post corrective information instead; it doesn’t take much squinting to re-label both efforts as censorship and propaganda. This is not, I would note, to pass judgment as to whether those efforts are right or wrong (although I am skeptical); merely to note that there may be more evidence of synergy between the government and tech than it seems. It’s all a bit dystopian, to be sure, but revolutions by their nature are unpredictable; it wasn’t a certainty that liberal democracy would triumph in the fourth revolution, much less the current one.\n\nThere is also an argument to be made that the dramatic shift in monetary policy over the last 13 years — prompted by the Great Recession, but interestingly enough perfectly aligned with the smartphone era — is itself evidence of synergy: tech is inherently deflationary, which could be balancing out the inflationary potential of printing new money. This, needless to say, is a very complex topic, which is why I didn’t include it in my previous article; consider this paragraph as a point of speculation.\nFinancial Capital and Production Capital\nOne of the most important principles in Perez’s model is the difference between Financial Capital and Production Capital and the roles they play in the Installation period versus the Deployment period (just look at the name of the book!). Perez explains:\n\n  Financial capital is mobile by nature while production capital is basically tied to concrete products, both by installed equipment with specific operational capabilities and by linkages in networks of suppliers, customers or distributors in particular geographic locations. Financial capital can successfully invest in a firm or a project without much knowledge of what it does or how it does it. Its main question is potential profitability (sometimes even just the perception others may have about it). For production capital, knowledge about product, process and markets is the very foundation of potential success. The knowledge can be scientific and technical expertise or managerial experience, it can be innovative talent or entrepreneurial drive, but it will always be about specific areas and only partly mobile…\n  All these distinctions lead to a fundamental difference in level of commitment. Financial capital is footloose by nature; production capital has roots in an area of competence and even in a geographic region. Financial capital will flee danger; production capital has to face every storm by holding fast, ducking down or innovating its way forward or sideways. Yet, though the notion of progress and innovation is associated with production capital – and rightly so – ironically when it comes to radical change, incumbent production capital can become conservative and then it is the role of financial capital (whether from family, banks or ‘angels’) to enable the rise of the new entrepreneurs.\n\nFinancial capital is critical in the Installation period of a technological revolution. Because it is mobile and seeking a return it flows to new technologies that are just emerging; in the case of the current era that meant chips, then software, then services. Financial capital is also highly speculative, and provokes a frenzy that leads to a bubble, which is exactly what happened in the Dot Com era.\nProduction capital, on the other hand, is harvested from profitable businesses that re-invest their earnings to improve their products and expand their markets during the Deployment period. This has clearly been happening with the largest tech companies: one of the best investments one could have made over the last decade would have been stock in Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, not because they needed investor capital, but because they were so generating such exceptional returns from reinvesting their own profits.\nIndeed, the fact that the big 5 tech companies were so clearly powered by production capital is one of the reasons why I have always been skeptical that we are still stuck in the Turning Point; at the same time, it is not as if the venture capital industry had disappeared.\nFinancial Capital = Venture Capital\nVenture capital is another name for Financial capital; Perez writes:\n\n  As far as truly new ventures are concerned, innovators may have brilliant ideas for which they are willing to take huge risks, devoting their whole lives to bringing their projects to reality, but if finance is not forthcoming they can do nothing.\n\nThis is how I described venture capital in 2015’s Venture Capital and the Internet’s Impact:\n\n  In the case of startups, during the 45 years after Arthur Rock founded the first venture capital partnership in 1961, the vast majority of new firms needed significant funding from day one. Hardware startups of course needed specialized equipment, the funds to make prototypes, and then to set up actual manufacturing lines, but software startups, particularly those with any sort of online component, also needed to make significant hardware investments into servers, software that ran on said servers, and a staff to manage them. This was where the venture capitalists’ unique skill-set came into play: they identified the startups worthy of funding through little more than a PowerPoint and a person, and brought to bear the level of upfront capital necessary to make that startup a reality.\n\nThe point of that article, however, was to explain how AWS — a service — was transforming venture capital; now new products could be built in someone’s bedroom, leading to the rise of angels writing much smaller checks to much smaller teams achieving much larger impact much more quickly than ever before. This made a venture capitalist’s job easier in the short term — now they were writing checks based on existing products and growth metrics, instead of PowerPoints — but in the long run it meant that venture capital was becoming commoditized.\n\n  The story doesn’t end there: the trouble for venture capitalists is that they are getting squeezed from the top of the funding hierarchy as well: a new class of growth investors, many of them made up of traditional limited partners like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, are approaching unicorn companies on a portfolio basis…Sure, this is relatively dumb money, but that’s where those angel and incubator relationships come in: if startups increasingly feel they have the relationships and advice they need, then growth funding is basically a commodity, so why not take dumb cheap money sooner rather than later?\n  Interestingly, just as in every other commodity market, the greatest defense for venture capitalists turns out to be brand: firms like Benchmark, Sequoia, or Andreessen Horowitz can buy into firms at superior prices because it matters to the startup to have them on their cap table. Moreover, Andreessen Horowitz in particular has been very open about their goal to offer startups far more than money, including dedicated recruiting teams, marketing teams, and probably most usefully an active business development team. Expect the venture capitalist return power curve to grow even steeper.\n\nBrand, though, can only resist commoditization for so long; a16z in particular has dramatically accelerated its growth, and now the most famous brand name of all is going even further.\nSequoia’s Transformation\nSequoia Partner Roelof Botha wrote yesterday on Medium:\n\n  Innovations in venture capital haven’t kept pace with the companies we serve. Our industry is still beholden to a rigid 10-year fund cycle pioneered in the 1970s. As chips shrank and software flew to the cloud, venture capital kept operating on the business equivalent of floppy disks. Once upon a time the 10-year fund cycle made sense. But the assumptions it’s based on no longer hold true, curtailing meaningful relationships prematurely and misaligning companies and their investment partners. The best founders want to make a lasting impact in the world. Their ambition isn’t confined to a 10-year period. Neither is ours…\n  Today, we are excited to announce our boldest innovation yet to help founders build enduring companies for the 21st century. In our U.S./Europe business, we are breaking with the traditional organization based on fund cycles and restructuring Sequoia Capital around a singular, permanent structure: The Sequoia Fund.\n  Moving forward, our LPs will invest into The Sequoia Fund, an open-ended liquid portfolio made up of public positions in a selection of our enduring companies. The Sequoia Fund will in turn allocate capital to a series of closed-end sub funds for venture investments at every stage from inception to IPO. Proceeds from these venture investments will flow back into The Sequoia Fund in a continuous feedback loop. Investments will no longer have “expiration dates.” Our sole focus will be to grow value for our companies and limited partners over the long run.\n\nThis announcement, in Perez terms, is as clear as could be: Sequoia is transforming itself from financial capital to production capital. Instead of LP’s investing in funds that make speculative investments in risky endeavors, Sequoia wants to keep long-term positions in companies that have proven business models and are embarking on the decade (or longer) process of improving their products and expanding their markets to the entire world.\nThis also, I suspect, represents the formation of a sort of “Silicon Valley Inc.”; while the big 5 can entirely self-fund, the nature of the SaaS business model is such that companies with proven product-market fit are better off losing more money up-front rather than less:\n\nCustomers, once acquired, are like annuities that make money years into the future, but the cost to acquire them has to be paid up front.\nThe core software product represents a huge fixed cost investment that is leveraged by scaling to as many customers as possible.\n\nThe combination of these two factors means that SaaS companies take longer to self-fund, even if their models are proven; what Sequoia can do with their model is invest in an entire portfolio of these companies and hold onto them indefinitely, effectively recycling money from mature companies into nascent ones, much as Apple or Microsoft invests profits from their current products into the development of new ones. On an individual company level it looks like venture/financial capital; as a collective it is much more akin to production capital, especially once you realize that many of these companies, thanks to angels and AWS, are already fairly de-risked.\nMoreover, while Sequoia’s announcement feels so momentous because of their long history in the Valley, institutions like Tiger Capital are already playing the exact same game; the era of production capital is firmly upon us, which means we are clearly in the Deployment period of Perez’s model.\nGrowth and Crypto\nIn Perez’s model the Growth element in the Deployment period means “converging growth of most industries using [the new] paradigm”; that seems inconsistent with a reality where tech continues to provide a huge amount of growth relative to the rest of the economy.\nI think, though, that is a problem of definition: we still have a habit of calling everything that runs on a SaaS model a tech company, even if the actual industry or service being rendered isn’t about tech at all. Is Warby Parker a tech company? Is Carvana? Is DoorDash? The list goes on-and-on: new companies are created using technology, but of course they are! Calling everything a tech company is like calling a shopping mall a car company; sure, it was enabled by and undergirded by the automobile, but what in that era wasn’t? To return to The End of the Beginning:\n\n  Indeed, this is exactly what we see in consumer startups in particular: few companies are pure “tech” companies seeking to disrupt the dominant cloud and mobile players; rather, they take their presence as an assumption, and seek to transform society in ways that were previously impossible when computing was a destination, not a given. That is exactly what happened with the automobile: its existence stopped being interesting in its own right, while the implications of its existence changed everything.\n\nThat leaves the question of crypto; given its oppositional nature to the current paradigm — decentralization, encryption, and ownership — it is clearly something completely new; moreover, the capital chasing returns in crypto is clearly financial capital, not production capital.\nIt’s certainly possible for a new paradigm to emerge alongside an existing paradigm; Perez notes on multiple instances her model is stylized, and details multiple periods of overlap. What is notable, though, is that crypto draws talent from the same pool that drives the IT revolution, and it’s unclear what the impact of this drain will be on the current paradigm. The optimistic take is that the shift to remote work will dramatically increase the available talent pool to tech-companies-that-are-actually-just-companies, and it’s one I share: the opportunity now is in new markets, not new tech, and open source software, along with public clouds, provides a strong foundation for any new company.\nThat suggests that crypto will continue to exist in a bit of a parallel universe, which makes sense; it already has its own currencies, after all. That is another way of saying I think that crypto is still very early in its lifecycle; 2017 wasn’t the big crash, nor will the next one be — remember that tech had its own internal boom-and-bust cycles in the three decades between the introduction of the Intel processor and the Dotcom bubble. Nor is this a bearish take: those three decades were exceptionally profitable for everyone involved — including Sequoia, which was founded in 1972. Perhaps its successor, the one that shifts to providing productive capital for crypto companies decades from now, has already been born.\nDo read that piece first, if you haven’t, and Jerry Neumann’s overview of Perez’s theory. ↩",

The process of installation of each new techno-economic paradigm in society begins with a battle against the power of the old, which is ingrained in the established production structure and embedded in the socio-cultural environment and in the institutional framework. Only when that battle has been practically won can the paradigm really diffuse across the whole economy of the core nations and later across the world…</p>\n<p>  In very broad terms, each surge goes through two periods of a very different nature, each lasting about three decades.</p>\n<p>  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-3.png?resize=640%2C504&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Two different periods in each great surge\" width=\"640\" height=\"504\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7802\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-3.png?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-3.png?resize=1024%2C806&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-3.png?resize=768%2C604&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-3.png?resize=801%2C630&amp;ssl=1 801w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>  As shown in Figure 4.1, the first half can be termed the installation period. It is the time when the new technologies irrupt in a maturing economy and advance like a bulldozer disrupting the established fabric and articulating new industrial networks, setting up new infrastructures and spreading new and superior ways of doing things. At the beginning of that period, the revolution is a small fact and a big promise; at the end, the new paradigm is a significant force, having overcome the resistance of the old paradigm and being ready to serve as propeller of widespread growth.</p>\n<p>  The second half is the deployment period, when the fabric of the whole economy is rewoven and reshaped by the modernizing power of the triumphant paradigm, which then becomes normal best practice, enabling the full unfolding of its wealth generating potential.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>What made Perez&#8217;s observation so trenchant in 2002 is that part in the middle: the turning point.</p>\n<h4>The Post-Dotcom Era</h4>\n<p>While the Installation Period begins with irruption as new technology emerges in pursuit of real world applications, it eventual transitions into a full-blown frenzy as speculative capital pursues increasingly fantastical commercial applications.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-2.png?resize=640%2C442&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Recurring phases of each great surge\" width=\"640\" height=\"442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7803\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-2.png?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-2.png?resize=1024%2C707&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-2.png?resize=768%2C530&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/perez-2.png?resize=912%2C630&amp;ssl=1 912w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Reality, though, catches up, and the bubble pops.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This financial frenzy is a powerful force in propagating the technological revolution, in particular its infrastructure, and enhancing – even exaggerating – the superiority of the new products, industries and generic technologies. The ostentation of success pushes the logic of the new paradigm to the fore and makes it into the contemporary ideal of vitality and dynamism. It also contributes to institutional change, at least concerning the ‘destruction’ half of creative destruction.</p>\n<p>  At the same time, as mentioned before, all this excitement divides society, widening the gap between rich and poor and making it less and less tenable in social terms. The economy also becomes unsustainable, due to the appearance of two growing imbalances. One is the mismatch between the profile of demand and that of potential supply. The very process by which intense investment was made possible by concentrating income at the upper end of the spectrum becomes an obstacle for the expansion of production of any particular product and for the attainment of full economies of scale.  The other is the rift between paper values and real values. So the system is structurally unstable and cannot grow indefinitely along that path.</p>\n<p>  With the collapse comes recession – sometimes depression – bringing financial capital back to reality. This, together with mounting social pressure, creates the conditions for institutional restructuring. In this atmosphere of urgency many of the social innovations, which gradually emerged during the period of installation, are likely to be brought together with new regulation in the financial and other spheres, to create a favorable context for recoupling and full unfolding of the growth potential. This crucial recomposition happens at the turning point which leaves behind the turbulent times of installation and paradigm transition to enter the ‘golden age’ that can follow, depending on the institutional and social choices made.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This certainly seems to describe the Dotcom Bubble, which was not only destructive to speculators directly but the economy broadly, even as its excesses, particularly in terms of broadband build-up, funded the infrastructure that would fuel the Internet over the next two decades. And, by extension, those two decades would seem to be the Golden Age of the &#8220;Deployment Period.&#8221; That certainly seems to be the case with technological dispersion: today over four billion people have access to the Internet, and thanks to the global nature of the web, those in developing countries can consume and create on the same platforms as the most well off.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the &#8220;Capital&#8221; part of Perez&#8217;s theory seems to fit as well: some of the best returns over the last fifteen years have been in established public companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook — &#8220;Production Capital&#8221;, in Perez&#8217;s nomenclature. Venture capital, meanwhile, which is theoretically speculative &#8220;Financial Capital&#8221;, has increasingly become professionalized and standardized, thanks in part to the rise of cloud platforms <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/cloudflares-disruption/\">like AWS</a>; building a new SaaS company to take on another old-world vertical certainly takes hard work, but the playbook is fairly well-known.</p>\n<p>This was my thinking behind 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/\">The End of the Beginning</a>; I wasn&#8217;t <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning-follow-up-technological-revolutions-and-financial-capital-venture-versus-productive-capital/\">thinking of Perez when I wrote that</a>, to be honest, even though I reached for the automobile example. It just seemed clear to me that the post Dotcom Bubble era had reached its natural endpoint as far as market structure was concerned; whatever came next would look significantly different.</p>\n<p>Perez disagrees.</p>\n<h4>The Imminent Golden Age</h4>\n<p>While the introduction to <em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em> makes the case that the Dotcom Bubble was the Turning Point, Perez now thinks we are still waiting for the Golden Age — and that there may be another crash in the future (Perez now includes the Great Recession as part of the current revolution&#8217;s Turning Point).</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I respect your view.

The first thing we have to understand is that every Golden Age has had to do with social-political choices made by governments, because capitalism really only becomes legitimate when the greed of some is for the benefit of the many.</p>\n<p>  I think in order to tell you what needs to happen next time I have to give you an example from the past, because otherwise we don&#8217;t learn anything from history, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to understand how revolutions happen before. The mass production revolution brought the post-War boom. Now what happened then? If we look at the 1930s, we have some similarities with today. We see xenophobia, we see a lot of people angry and following at that time fascism and communism, now all sorts of extremisms right and left, leaders that really offer heaven even though they cannot delivery, but the whole thing is that people are angry and disappointed.</p>\n<p>  But you also have something else which is very important, which is that there is an enormous technological potential which is not being used. Not enough investment is going in the possible innovations because there is not enough demand, and demand is normally created by some policies. But it has to be policies that are adequate for that particular revolution. So what was the previous revolution? It was about mass production. So what was the direction in which it was tilted?</p>\n<p>  Well, first of all it was the World War. And with the World War it was obvious that producing a lot of weapons made a lot of good business sense. They became cheaper and better and so on. But then at the end of the war, governments did something very important: they created a set of policies that favored suburbanization. Before the automobile you had railways, so you only had stations, and the land in-between was very cheap, it had no way of being used. But once you have the automobile you can build cheap mass-produced houses to put lots of electrical appliances inside and the car at the door. And at the same time governments made the welfare state so that workers could buy those houses. So you have home ownership and consumerism, that&#8217;s one of the directions, and the other direction was the Cold War of course, so that you had innovation going in the two directions.</p>\n<p>  If we had stayed in what was visible in the 30s, it was very difficult to imagine this Golden Age that came after the war. The same thing is happening to us now. In order to get the technologies to go in the right direction, you&#8217;ve got to tilt the playing field, and I hold that the most effective way of doing that today is tilting it towards &#8216;Green&#8217;.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Perez&#8217;s view on how a focus on &#8220;Green&#8221; policies could fuel a Golden Age are well fleshed-out in papers like <a href=\"http://beyondthetechrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BTTR_WP_2018-1.pdf\">A Smart Green &#8216;European Way of Life&#8217;: the Path for Growth, Jobs and Wellbeing</a>; one insight that I find very compelling is that the demand that drives job growth is less about the technology itself and more about the new lifestyle that the technology enables (just like suburbanization drove the previous revolution).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that Perez has a somewhat darker interpretation of the 1930&#8217;s in <em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em> (<em>emphasis mine</em>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Regarding recovery in the 1930s, one cannot look at the USA only.

Perez noted in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The mass-production revolution, which marked most of the institutions of the twentieth century, underlay the centralized governments and massive consumption patterns of the four great modes of growth that were set up to take advantage of those technologies: the Keynesian democracies, Nazi-fascism, Soviet socialism and State developmentalism in the so-called ‘Third World,’ each with very wide-ranging specificities.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Synergies are not always golden.</p>\n<h4>The China Model</h4>\n<p>Another observation from Perez is that new technological revolutions create the conditions for newcomers to &#8220;leapfrog&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In periods of paradigm shift there is a window of opportunity for real catching up as well as for forging ahead. Belgium, France and the USA caught up in the installation period of the second surge; Germany and the USA forged ahead in that of the third.

The only mention is in the postscript:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Yet, in the globalized world of the present paradigm, demand is also global. The best promise of massive market expansion would seem to be in the incorporation of more and more countries to global growth, investment, production and consumption. Growth in the larger countries of the developing world, together with China, Russia and the ex-socialist group of Eastern Europe, could serve as a first tier to pull the others forward. It is quite obvious that these potentially huge markets are a very long way from saturation.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was a view reflective of the era in which it was written, in which it was assumed that the Internet, in conjunction with globalization, would liberalize and ultimately democratize China. In 2000, President Bill Clinton, upon the occasion of the establishment of Permanent Normal Relations with China said <a href=\"https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/Full_Text_of_Clintons_Speech_on_China_Trade_Bi.htm\">in a speech</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When China joins the W.T.O., by 2005 it will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, making the tools of communication even cheaper, better, and more widely available. We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China.</p>\n<p>  Now there’s no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. (Chuckles.) Good luck! (Laughter.) That’s sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall. (Laughter.) But I would argue to you that their effort to do that just proves how real these changes are and how much they threaten the status quo. It’s not an argument for slowing down the effort to bring China into the world, it’s an argument for accelerating that effort. In the knowledge economy, economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Things obviously didn&#8217;t work out that way; if anything the Internet has <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/\">allowed China to push its values onto Americans</a>. What is worth noting, though, is that you can make the case that China has entered the Synergy phase in which government has aligned with technology to profoundly impact China&#8217;s citizens. That this entails mass surveillance, censorship, and propaganda doesn&#8217;t undo Perez&#8217;s thesis; it perhaps punctures her optimism.</p>\n<p>There are signs a weaker, yet in some ways similar, form of synergy has happened in the U.S. as well; soon after the Dotcom Bubble came the Patriot Act, and while the political motivations were the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the implementation was very much about leveraging technology for government ends. The extent of this synergy only became clear in 2013 when the Snowden revelations exposed a vast web of surveillance conducted by tech and telecommunications companies in partnership with the NSA.</p>\n<p>Then, over the last several years, there has been a concerted effort to push tech companies to increasingly limit misinformation on their networks, and post corrective information instead; it doesn&#8217;t take much squinting to re-label both efforts as censorship and propaganda. This is not, I would note, to pass judgment as to whether those efforts are right or wrong (although <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-files-continued-misinformation-and-vaccinations-fact-checking-and-the-unknown/\">I am skeptical</a>); merely to note that there may be more evidence of synergy between the government and tech than it seems. It&#8217;s all a bit dystopian, to be sure, but revolutions by their nature are unpredictable; it wasn&#8217;t a certainty that liberal democracy would triumph in the fourth revolution, much less the current one.</p>\n<h4>A Crypto Revolution?</h4>\n<p>As the tweet above makes clear, Perez relishes debate about her theories; I am one of many writers on the Internet who have had the distinct pleasure of getting an email out of the blue from Perez, and having a conversation where she pushes and prods to understand the other&#8217;s point of view, confident it will make her theses stronger.</p>\n<p>And, in that spirit, I have to confess I&#8217;m not sure if this rebuttal to Perez&#8217;s current position — my sense that we are in the maturation phase of the technological revolution, complete with government synergy — is correct or not. Perez has noted that COVID-19 could end what she thinks is the elongated turning point era, much like World War II ended the elongated turning point era of the previous revolution (at least in the U.S.). It is notable, for example, that the tech industry has also been an essential element in various government lockdown strategies during the COVID pandemic, most obviously by making it possible for the economy to continue to function while people work from home, and also in enabling a work-from-home lifestyle via e-commerce and food delivery services, with all of the commensurate jobs entailed in providing these services. That is a fundamental change to society that is only getting started — perhaps a new Golden Era is in fact imminent.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is notable that crypto, the most obvious candidate for the next technological revolution is not — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kwDMMBPOhw\">contra Perez</a> — an obvious extension of the current era. The overarching story of Stratechery has been the rise and consolidation of the aforementioned Big 5 tech companies, and the entire premise of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a> is the inevitability of centralization in a world of frictionless abundance. Crypto, though, is about the introduction of scarcity; its payoff is decentralization, at the cost, at least for now, of convenience and speed.</p>\n<p>Perez writes in <em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em> about what the Maturity phase looks like:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This is the twilight of the golden age, though it shines with false splendor. It is the drive to maturity of the paradigm and to the gradual saturation of markets. The last technology systems and the last products in each of them have very short life cycles, since accumulated experience leads to very rapid learning and saturation curves. Gradually the paradigm is taken to its ultimate consequences until it shows up its limitations.</p>\n<p>  Yet, all the signs of prosperity and success are still around. Those who reaped the full benefits of the ‘golden age’ (or of the gilded one) continue to hold on to their belief in the virtues of the system and to proclaim eternal and unstoppable progress, in a complacent blindness, which could be called the ‘Great Society syndrome’. But the unfulfilled promises had been piling up, while most people nurtured the expectation of personal and social advance. The result is an increasing socio-political split…this is a time when deep questions about the system are being asked in many quarters; the climate is favorable for politics and ideological confrontations to come to the fore. The social ferment can become intense and is sometimes quelled with social reforms.</p>\n<p>  Meanwhile, in the world of big business, markets are saturating and technologies maturing, therefore profits begin to feel the productivity constriction. Ways are being sought for propping them up, which often involve concentration through mergers or acquisitions, as well as export drives and migration of activities to less-saturated markets abroad. Their relative success makes firms amass even more money without profitable investment outlets. The search for technological solutions lifts the implicit ban on truly new technologies outside the logic of the now exhausted paradigm. The stage is set for the decline of the whole mode of growth and for the next technological revolution.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That seems awfully descriptive of the current era, no? Products that break through reach saturation in record time (see TikTok reaching a billion users in three years, or DTC companies that seem to max out in only a couple of years), while the future of established companies seems to be quagmire in legislators and the courts, even as profits continue to pile up without obvious places to invest. And if the government&#8217;s response to the revolution has been disappointing, that also may be <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/\">because of the revolution itself</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent the dystopian picture above is correct — that the real synergy has been between centralized governments and centralized tech companies, to the alarm of both <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/\">those abroad</a> and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-political-problems/\">in the U.S.</a> — the greater the motivation there is to make the speculative investments that drive the next paradigm, especially if that paradigm operates in direct opposition to the current one. To be sure this framework does imply that crypto is full of scams and on its way to inflating a spectacular bubble, the aftermath of which will be painful for many, but that is both expected and increasingly borne out by the facts as well. What will matter for the future is how much infrastructure — particularly wallet installation — can be built-out in the meantime.</p>\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth my suspicion is that the current Installation period for crypto — if that is indeed where we are — has a long ways to run, which is another way of saying most of the economy will remain in the current paradigm for a while longer. The time from the Intel microprocessor to the Dotcom Bubble bursting was 30 years (and, it should be noted, there were a lot of smaller, more localized bubbles along the way); Satoshi Nakamoto only published his paper in 2008. Thirteen years after 1971 was 1984, the year the Mac was introduced; the browser was another 9 years away. It&#8217;s one thing to see the future coming; it&#8217;s something else entirely to know the timing. On that Perez and I can certainly agree.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/technological-revolutions-follow-up-crypto-and-cheap-energy-the-stratechery-2-schedule/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-7798\"><p >This list is transcribed from the second Table 2.1 — there are two — on page 11 of 2014 paperback edition of <em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-death-and-birth-of-technological-revolutions/#rf1-7798\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "What was especially remarkable about Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital was its timing: 2002 was the middle of the cold winter that followed the Dotcom Bubble, and here was Perez arguing that the IT revolution and the Internet were not in fact dead ideas, but in the middle of a natural transition to a new Golden Age.\nNote: the following is a woefully incomplete summary of what is a brilliant — and very readable — book. Jerry Neumann has written an excellent overview of Perez’s theory at Reaction Wheel; I highly recommend reading that first if you are unfamiliar with Perez’s work.\nPerez’s thesis was based on over 200 years of history and the patterns she identified in four previous technological revolutions:1\n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in 1771, with the opening of Arkwright’s mill in Cromford\nThe Age of Steam and Railways began in the United Kingdom in 1829, with the test of the ‘Rocket’ steam engine for the Liverpool-Manchester railway\nThe Age of Steel, Electricity and Heavy Engineering began in the United States in 1875, with the opening of the Carnegie Bessemer steel plant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nThe Age of Oil, the Automobile, and Mass Production began in the United States in 1908, with the production of the first Ford Model-T in Detroit, Michigan\nThe Age of Information and Telecommunications began in the United States in 1971, with the announcement of the Intel microprocessor in Santa Clara, California\n\nPerez’s argument was that the four technological revolutions that proceeded the Age of Information and Telecommunications followed a similar cycle:\n\nHowever, this process is usually disjointed; Perez writes:\n\n  In real life, the trajectory of a technological revolution is not as smooth and continuous as the stylized curve presented in Figure 3.1. The process of installation of each new techno-economic paradigm in society begins with a battle against the power of the old, which is ingrained in the established production structure and embedded in the socio-cultural environment and in the institutional framework. Only when that battle has been practically won can the paradigm really diffuse across the whole economy of the core nations and later across the world…\n  In very broad terms, each surge goes through two periods of a very different nature, each lasting about three decades.\n  \n  As shown in Figure 4.1, the first half can be termed the installation period. It is the time when the new technologies irrupt in a maturing economy and advance like a bulldozer disrupting the established fabric and articulating new industrial networks, setting up new infrastructures and spreading new and superior ways of doing things. At the beginning of that period, the revolution is a small fact and a big promise; at the end, the new paradigm is a significant force, having overcome the resistance of the old paradigm and being ready to serve as propeller of widespread growth.\n  The second half is the deployment period, when the fabric of the whole economy is rewoven and reshaped by the modernizing power of the triumphant paradigm, which then becomes normal best practice, enabling the full unfolding of its wealth generating potential.\n\nWhat made Perez’s observation so trenchant in 2002 is that part in the middle: the turning point.\nThe Post-Dotcom Era\nWhile the Installation Period begins with irruption as new technology emerges in pursuit of real world applications, it eventual transitions into a full-blown frenzy as speculative capital pursues increasingly fantastical commercial applications.\n\nReality, though, catches up, and the bubble pops.\n\n  This financial frenzy is a powerful force in propagating the technological revolution, in particular its infrastructure, and enhancing – even exaggerating – the superiority of the new products, industries and generic technologies. The ostentation of success pushes the logic of the new paradigm to the fore and makes it into the contemporary ideal of vitality and dynamism. It also contributes to institutional change, at least concerning the ‘destruction’ half of creative destruction.\n  At the same time, as mentioned before, all this excitement divides society, widening the gap between rich and poor and making it less and less tenable in social terms. The economy also becomes unsustainable, due to the appearance of two growing imbalances. One is the mismatch between the profile of demand and that of potential supply. The very process by which intense investment was made possible by concentrating income at the upper end of the spectrum becomes an obstacle for the expansion of production of any particular product and for the attainment of full economies of scale.  The other is the rift between paper values and real values. So the system is structurally unstable and cannot grow indefinitely along that path.\n  With the collapse comes recession – sometimes depression – bringing financial capital back to reality. This, together with mounting social pressure, creates the conditions for institutional restructuring. In this atmosphere of urgency many of the social innovations, which gradually emerged during the period of installation, are likely to be brought together with new regulation in the financial and other spheres, to create a favorable context for recoupling and full unfolding of the growth potential. This crucial recomposition happens at the turning point which leaves behind the turbulent times of installation and paradigm transition to enter the ‘golden age’ that can follow, depending on the institutional and social choices made.\n\nThis certainly seems to describe the Dotcom Bubble, which was not only destructive to speculators directly but the economy broadly, even as its excesses, particularly in terms of broadband build-up, funded the infrastructure that would fuel the Internet over the next two decades. And, by extension, those two decades would seem to be the Golden Age of the “Deployment Period.” That certainly seems to be the case with technological dispersion: today over four billion people have access to the Internet, and thanks to the global nature of the web, those in developing countries can consume and create on the same platforms as the most well off.\nMoreover, the “Capital” part of Perez’s theory seems to fit as well: some of the best returns over the last fifteen years have been in established public companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook — “Production Capital”, in Perez’s nomenclature. Venture capital, meanwhile, which is theoretically speculative “Financial Capital”, has increasingly become professionalized and standardized, thanks in part to the rise of cloud platforms like AWS; building a new SaaS company to take on another old-world vertical certainly takes hard work, but the playbook is fairly well-known.\nThis was my thinking behind 2020’s The End of the Beginning; I wasn’t thinking of Perez when I wrote that, to be honest, even though I reached for the automobile example. It just seemed clear to me that the post Dotcom Bubble era had reached its natural endpoint as far as market structure was concerned; whatever came next would look significantly different.\nPerez disagrees.\nThe Imminent Golden Age\nWhile the introduction to Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital makes the case that the Dotcom Bubble was the Turning Point, Perez now thinks we are still waiting for the Golden Age — and that there may be another crash in the future (Perez now includes the Great Recession as part of the current revolution’s Turning Point).\n\n\nI respect your view. Theories belong to the public. But I see the present as the 1930s, the turning point of the IT surge. We have had 2 frenzies and we have not yet had a golden age. The power of AI, IoT, 3D, robots, blockchain is there to be shaped https://t.co/FybfqgLJLM\n— Carlota Perez (@CarlotaPrzPerez) March 31, 2019\n \nPerez’s link is to the Financial Times’ Tech Tonic podcast; the pertinent part starts at the 3:48 mark:\n\n  The important thing is that the previous revolutions had the Golden Age after the recession that follows the crash. And we could now perhaps have a global sustainable Golden Age. I think it is perfectly possible with the current technologies.\n  What would be necessary to bring that Golden Age about? How do we need to tilt the playing field to make that happen?\n  Well “tilt the playing field” is the word. The first thing we have to understand is that every Golden Age has had to do with social-political choices made by governments, because capitalism really only becomes legitimate when the greed of some is for the benefit of the many.\n  I think in order to tell you what needs to happen next time I have to give you an example from the past, because otherwise we don’t learn anything from history, and that’s why it’s important to understand how revolutions happen before. The mass production revolution brought the post-War boom. Now what happened then? If we look at the 1930s, we have some similarities with today. We see xenophobia, we see a lot of people angry and following at that time fascism and communism, now all sorts of extremisms right and left, leaders that really offer heaven even though they cannot delivery, but the whole thing is that people are angry and disappointed.\n  But you also have something else which is very important, which is that there is an enormous technological potential which is not being used. Not enough investment is going in the possible innovations because there is not enough demand, and demand is normally created by some policies. But it has to be policies that are adequate for that particular revolution. So what was the previous revolution? It was about mass production. So what was the direction in which it was tilted?\n  Well, first of all it was the World War. And with the World War it was obvious that producing a lot of weapons made a lot of good business sense. They became cheaper and better and so on. But then at the end of the war, governments did something very important: they created a set of policies that favored suburbanization. Before the automobile you had railways, so you only had stations, and the land in-between was very cheap, it had no way of being used. But once you have the automobile you can build cheap mass-produced houses to put lots of electrical appliances inside and the car at the door. And at the same time governments made the welfare state so that workers could buy those houses. So you have home ownership and consumerism, that’s one of the directions, and the other direction was the Cold War of course, so that you had innovation going in the two directions.\n  If we had stayed in what was visible in the 30s, it was very difficult to imagine this Golden Age that came after the war. The same thing is happening to us now. In order to get the technologies to go in the right direction, you’ve got to tilt the playing field, and I hold that the most effective way of doing that today is tilting it towards ‘Green’.\n\nPerez’s view on how a focus on “Green” policies could fuel a Golden Age are well fleshed-out in papers like A Smart Green ‘European Way of Life’: the Path for Growth, Jobs and Wellbeing; one insight that I find very compelling is that the demand that drives job growth is less about the technology itself and more about the new lifestyle that the technology enables (just like suburbanization drove the previous revolution).\nIt’s worth noting, though, that Perez has a somewhat darker interpretation of the 1930’s in Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital (emphasis mine):\n\n  Regarding recovery in the 1930s, one cannot look at the USA only. In Germany, with Hitler’s rise to power, the institutional framework was reoriented to facilitate the development of mass production (and later of mass destruction and genocide). The war economy that began after 1933 in Germany could be seen as a synergy phase of a sort. Fortunately, the Nazis failed to conquer Europe and lost the war; otherwise, National Socialist Germany might have been the center of a longer-lasting fascist world. At that same time, the Soviet economy too was developing very fast with another mode of growth that was also capable of intensively deploying mass production. This wide range of options for the deployment of that particular paradigm — including the Keynesian democracies that will have the USA as their core — is an indication of how much is at stake and how much is decided about the future of each country and of the world at the turning point of each surge.\n\nThis isn’t a throwaway observation; Perez’s chart of technological revolutions is clear that the U.S. and Europe were on different timelines:\n\nThe implication of this observation is that the “Synergy” phase is amoral; it is not guaranteed that the alignment of government with the new technological revolution and its resultant impact on people leads to a “better” outcome as far as liberal democracy is concerned. Perez noted in a footnote:\n\n  The mass-production revolution, which marked most of the institutions of the twentieth century, underlay the centralized governments and massive consumption patterns of the four great modes of growth that were set up to take advantage of those technologies: the Keynesian democracies, Nazi-fascism, Soviet socialism and State developmentalism in the so-called ‘Third World,’ each with very wide-ranging specificities.\n\nSynergies are not always golden.\nThe China Model\nAnother observation from Perez is that new technological revolutions create the conditions for newcomers to “leapfrog”:\n\n  In periods of paradigm shift there is a window of opportunity for real catching up as well as for forging ahead. Belgium, France and the USA caught up in the installation period of the second surge; Germany and the USA forged ahead in that of the third. Most of Europe, Japan and the Soviet Union, caught up in the fourth (though the latter fell dramatically behind with the fifth).\n\nThis is where the absence of China from Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital is notable. The only mention is in the postscript:\n\n  Yet, in the globalized world of the present paradigm, demand is also global. The best promise of massive market expansion would seem to be in the incorporation of more and more countries to global growth, investment, production and consumption. Growth in the larger countries of the developing world, together with China, Russia and the ex-socialist group of Eastern Europe, could serve as a first tier to pull the others forward. It is quite obvious that these potentially huge markets are a very long way from saturation.\n\nThis was a view reflective of the era in which it was written, in which it was assumed that the Internet, in conjunction with globalization, would liberalize and ultimately democratize China.

The extent of this synergy only became clear in 2013 when the Snowden revelations exposed a vast web of surveillance conducted by tech and telecommunications companies in partnership with the NSA.\nThen, over the last several years, there has been a concerted effort to push tech companies to increasingly limit misinformation on their networks, and post corrective information instead; it doesn’t take much squinting to re-label both efforts as censorship and propaganda. This is not, I would note, to pass judgment as to whether those efforts are right or wrong (although I am skeptical); merely to note that there may be more evidence of synergy between the government and tech than it seems. It’s all a bit dystopian, to be sure, but revolutions by their nature are unpredictable; it wasn’t a certainty that liberal democracy would triumph in the fourth revolution, much less the current one.\nA Crypto Revolution?\nAs the tweet above makes clear, Perez relishes debate about her theories; I am one of many writers on the Internet who have had the distinct pleasure of getting an email out of the blue from Perez, and having a conversation where she pushes and prods to understand the other’s point of view, confident it will make her theses stronger.\nAnd, in that spirit, I have to confess I’m not sure if this rebuttal to Perez’s current position — my sense that we are in the maturation phase of the technological revolution, complete with government synergy — is correct or not. Perez has noted that COVID-19 could end what she thinks is the elongated turning point era, much like World War II ended the elongated turning point era of the previous revolution (at least in the U.S.). It is notable, for example, that the tech industry has also been an essential element in various government lockdown strategies during the COVID pandemic, most obviously by making it possible for the economy to continue to function while people work from home, and also in enabling a work-from-home lifestyle via e-commerce and food delivery services, with all of the commensurate jobs entailed in providing these services. That is a fundamental change to society that is only getting started — perhaps a new Golden Era is in fact imminent.\nAt the same time, it is notable that crypto, the most obvious candidate for the next technological revolution is not — contra Perez — an obvious extension of the current era. The overarching story of Stratechery has been the rise and consolidation of the aforementioned Big 5 tech companies, and the entire premise of Aggregation Theory is the inevitability of centralization in a world of frictionless abundance. Crypto, though, is about the introduction of scarcity; its payoff is decentralization, at the cost, at least for now, of convenience and speed.\nPerez writes in Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital about what the Maturity phase looks like:\n\n  This is the twilight of the golden age, though it shines with false splendor. It is the drive to maturity of the paradigm and to the gradual saturation of markets. The last technology systems and the last products in each of them have very short life cycles, since accumulated experience leads to very rapid learning and saturation curves. Gradually the paradigm is taken to its ultimate consequences until it shows up its limitations.\n  Yet, all the signs of prosperity and success are still around. Those who reaped the full benefits of the ‘golden age’ (or of the gilded one) continue to hold on to their belief in the virtues of the system and to proclaim eternal and unstoppable progress, in a complacent blindness, which could be called the ‘Great Society syndrome’. But the unfulfilled promises had been piling up, while most people nurtured the expectation of personal and social advance. The result is an increasing socio-political split…this is a time when deep questions about the system are being asked in many quarters; the climate is favorable for politics and ideological confrontations to come to the fore. The social ferment can become intense and is sometimes quelled with social reforms.\n  Meanwhile, in the world of big business, markets are saturating and technologies maturing, therefore profits begin to feel the productivity constriction. Ways are being sought for propping them up, which often involve concentration through mergers or acquisitions, as well as export drives and migration of activities to less-saturated markets abroad. Their relative success makes firms amass even more money without profitable investment outlets. The search for technological solutions lifts the implicit ban on truly new technologies outside the logic of the now exhausted paradigm. The stage is set for the decline of the whole mode of growth and for the next technological revolution.\n\nThat seems awfully descriptive of the current era, no? Products that break through reach saturation in record time (see TikTok reaching a billion users in three years, or DTC companies that seem to max out in only a couple of years), while the future of established companies seems to be quagmire in legislators and the courts, even as profits continue to pile up without obvious places to invest. And if the government’s response to the revolution has been disappointing, that also may be because of the revolution itself.\nMoreover, to the extent the dystopian picture above is correct — that the real synergy has been between centralized governments and centralized tech companies, to the alarm of both those abroad and in the U.S. — the greater the motivation there is to make the speculative investments that drive the next paradigm, especially if that paradigm operates in direct opposition to the current one. To be sure this framework does imply that crypto is full of scams and on its way to inflating a spectacular bubble, the aftermath of which will be painful for many, but that is both expected and increasingly borne out by the facts as well. What will matter for the future is how much infrastructure — particularly wallet installation — can be built-out in the meantime.\nFor what it’s worth my suspicion is that the current Installation period for crypto — if that is indeed where we are — has a long ways to run, which is another way of saying most of the economy will remain in the current paradigm for a while longer. The time from the Intel microprocessor to the Dotcom Bubble bursting was 30 years (and, it should be noted, there were a lot of smaller, more localized bubbles along the way); Satoshi Nakamoto only published his paper in 2008. Thirteen years after 1971 was 1984, the year the Mac was introduced; the browser was another 9 years away. It’s one thing to see the future coming; it’s something else entirely to know the timing. On that Perez and I can certainly agree.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.\nThis list is transcribed from the second Table 2.1 — there are two — on page 11 of 2014 paperback edition of Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital ↩",

This does, on one hand, provide for endless amounts of content, much of which, frankly, I would like to move on from; it also means that writing about one aspect of Facebook is fraught with risk: just because you defend one aspect, or attack another, does not mean one is making a comment on the entirety of the corporate beast. Word limits, though, are a thing — yes, even on the web — which means that one can never cover all of one&#8217;s bases in any one individual article.<sup id=\"rf1-7756\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-political-problems/#fn1-7756\" title=\"This is where I am jealous of those who do nothing but attack Facebook; no nuance is, if nothing else, succinct.\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>So consider this piece self-service, of sorts: this Article will be what I link to in future posts with the caveat, &#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about Facebook political issues today; if you want my big-picture take follow this link.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Which will take you here.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A quick aside about timing: this post is being written the day after Frances Haugen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOnpVQnv5Cw\">appeared before Congress</a>; I&#8217;m not writing about her testimony specifically, as I felt it covered very little new ground. <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-down-the-whistleblower-facebook-power/\">Saying as much</a>, though, did seem to prompt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1445539995201130501\">a lot of misunderstanding</a> and, frustratingly, allegations of bad faith, which, optimistically, might have been alleviated by a link to an article like this one.</p>\n<p>What I did want to do is — word limit be damned — write a post about Facebook&#8217;s political problems, as I perceive them, in their entirety. I do think the media gets a lot of things wrong about Facebook, not because there aren&#8217;t problems, but because the problems are more profound than the issue of the day. So here&#8217;s my best shot.</p>\n<h4>Facebook&#8217;s Benefit</h4>\n<p>This is perhaps an odd place to start, but it cuts to the core of why I do see real benefits to Facebook&#8217;s existence in the world, and is an important part of the trade-off calculations I make in the sections that follow.</p>\n<p>I believe that the economy of the future will, if we don&#8217;t stifle it along the way, look considerably different than <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/\">the post World War II order</a> dominated by large multinational corporations whose differentiation was predicated <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/technology-changing-world-pg-edition/\">on distribution</a>. Instead the future looks <a href=\"https://exponent.fm/episode-012-the-internet-rainforest/\">more like a rainforest</a>, with platforms that span the globe and millions of niche businesses that sit on top.</p>\n<p>I am, given my career, biased in this regard, but the rise of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">platforms like Shopify</a>, Etsy, Substack, and the App Store is evidence that new careers can be built and untold niches filled when the entire world is your addressable market. The challenge in a worldwide market, though, is finding the customers who are interested in the niche being filled; this is where Facebook&#8217;s ad offering is very much a platform in its own right.</p>\n<p>Facebook, via its integration with a host of third party sites and apps, makes it possible for those sites and apps to collectively understand and target prospective customers with the same sort of proficiency that first-data powerhouses like Google and Amazon do, and they don&#8217;t need to hold or understand any third-party data to do so. It is difficult to overstate what a big deal this is: suddenly a Shopify merchant can compete with Amazon, a D2C startup with Unilever, or a blog with the New York Times.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Facebook&#8217;s platform, unlike many of its competitors, is entirely automated and auction-driven; that means that small businesses have the same shot at customers as their far larger competitors do. Facebook is also very adept at simplifying the process (in exchange for more margin, of course): simply specify how much a customer is worth to you, and Facebook will deliver that customer. It&#8217;s an advertising platform that truly levels the playing field, and I think it is a very good thing for the world.</p>\n<h4>Perceived Problem One: Privacy</h4>\n<p>The flipside of Facebook&#8217;s advertising platform is the reality that the company absolutely does ingest huge amounts of data. It is worth noting, though, that a big chunk of the most private human readable data is content that users give Facebook themselves when they use the site; Facebook combines that with all of the data it collects in all of those connected apps and sites — which are primarily about measuring conversions — in its <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/data-factories/\">Data Factory</a> to create machine-learning driven profiles that undergird its advertising. What Facebook does not do is sell user data, not only because data undergirds its advertising business, but also because nearly all of that data would be unintelligible and worthless to any entity other than Facebook.</p>\n<p>As I noted in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/privacy-fundamentalism/\">Privacy Fundamentalism</a>, it is tempting to imagine this data as being something akin to a file of your life just laying around for anyone to peruse; Apple has <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/privacy-labels-and-lookalike-audiences/\">implied precisely this</a> with some of its recent ads. The reality, though, is far more mundane: the nature of computers and the Internet is the spewing of data everywhere, and it is only in aggregate, in a data factory, than any insight from this collection of vectors can be derived, and only then in the context of a larger application like targeted advertising conducted at massive scale. It is exceedingly unlikely that Facebook could even make the data about any one individual readable by a human, and there is no incentive to do so; not only do third party apps and sites have no need nor desire for individual level data, neither do advertisers — Facebook&#8217;s entire value to both is as a matchmaker at scale.</p>\n<p>To my mind, the reality of data on Facebook is well worth the trade-off for the value Facebook&#8217;s advertising delivers to niche-focused businesses. Moreover, I feel much better about Facebook as a data mediator than about modular advertising stacks where data really is bought and sold. I do understand that lots of folks disagree with me on this point, but again, everything is a trade-off, and I think this one is worth it.</p>\n<h4>Perceived Problem Two: Competition</h4>\n<p>The core of my <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/\">Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet</a> is distinguishing between platforms and Aggregators; platforms are extremely valuable, because of the opportunities they enable, but are also more subject to abuse, because companies taking advantages of those opportunities are beholden to the platform. Aggregators, on the other hand, dominate their markets by controlling demand; suppliers are not locked in, but are rather seeking end users, who themselves can visit another website or open another app at any time. The societal value of Aggregators is lower than Platforms, but the extent to which they can inflict harm is more limited as well — competition really is just a click away.</p>\n<p>To that end, the only extent to which Facebook is a potential antitrust concern is in terms of advertising, thanks to its massive amount of proprietary data and highly advanced data factory. At the same time, Facebook&#8217;s auction driven format ensures that Facebook is not gouging advertisers, and the effectively infinite potential inventory in digital means that competitors are not locked out from building competing products; the only scarcity is audience attention. Moreover, tradeoffs matter here as well: Facebook having extremely effective data is good for businesses on its platform, and there are privacy concerns with forcing Facebook to share.</p>\n<p>On the consumer side, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/regulators-and-reality/\">I simply don&#8217;t see any anticompetitive concerns at all</a>. Consumers are not locked into a single communications app, but can and do multi-home, and can switch between competing services with a swipe. Facebook&#8217;s challenge is in continuing to keep users opening and using its apps, and there is plenty of evidence the company is struggling to do just that.</p>\n<p>A decade ago Facebook responded to this challenge by savvily buying upcoming communications apps like Instagram and WhatsApp; I do think that this reduced competition in the sector, particularly from an advertising perspective, and I do think <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/\">there is a case</a> for regulators to look much more critically at Aggregators buying other would-be Aggregators. That noted, in 2021 Facebook — even with Instagram and WhatsApp — faces more competition than ever before; the market worked, and regulators are very much on guard for similar purchases. Facebook is going to have to keep users with what it has, or builds.</p>\n<h4>Political Problem One: Facebook&#8217;s Competence</h4>\n<p>These first three points, taken together, paint a picture of an exceptionally well-run company and a very attractive business; there is a reason why Facebook is worth around a trillion dollars. At the same time, it is that exceptional competence that starts to explain Facebook&#8217;s current political predicament.</p>\n<p>Andrew Bosworth, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/microsofts-surface-event-facebook-cto-changes/\">Facebook&#8217;s New CTO</a>, wrote an internal memo in 2016 about Facebook&#8217;s commitment to growth that later leaked <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data\">to BuzzFeed</a>; it is essential to understanding Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly.</p>\n<p>  We connect people.</p>\n<p>  That can be good if they make it positive. Maybe someone finds love. Maybe it even saves the life of someone on the brink of suicide.</p>\n<p>  So we connect more people</p>\n<p>  That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.</p>\n<p>  And still we connect people.</p>\n<p>  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is &#42;de facto&#42; good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.</p>\n<p>  That isn’t something we are doing for ourselves. Or for our stock price (ha!). It is literally just what we do. We connect people. Period.</p>\n<p>  That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.</p>\n<p>  The natural state of the world is not connected. It is not unified. It is fragmented by borders, languages, and increasingly by different products. The best products don’t win. The ones everyone use win.</p>\n<p>  I know a lot of people don’t want to hear this. Most of us have the luxury of working in the warm glow of building products consumers love. But make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here. If you joined the company because it is doing great work, that’s why we get to do that great work. We do have great products but we still wouldn’t be half our size without pushing the envelope on growth. Nothing makes Facebook as valuable as having your friends on it, and no product decisions have gotten as many friends on as the ones made in growth. Not photo tagging. Not news feed. Not messenger. Nothing.</p>\n<p>  In almost all of our work, we have to answer hard questions about what we believe. We have to justify the metrics and make sure they aren’t losing out on a bigger picture. But connecting people. That’s our imperative. Because that’s what we do. We connect people.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the seventeen years since Facebook was founded the number of people using the Internet has grown from around a billion people to around 4.5 billion people; in developed countries the Internet is close to being universal, but developing countries are steadily catching up:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage#/media/File:Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_ITU.svg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-1.png?resize=640%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Worldwide Internet users over time\" width=\"640\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7759\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-1.png?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-1.png?resize=1024%2C819&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-1.png?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-1.png?resize=788%2C630&amp;ssl=1 788w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Of those 4.5 billion people, 3.5 billion use at at least one Facebook service on a monthly basis; 2.8 billion use at least one on a daily basis. That is exactly the sort of competence I was referring to above. As Bosworth notes, though, Facebook&#8217;s growth isn&#8217;t just about competence, but about a single-minded determination to do everything possible to make Facebook synonymous with the Internet.</p>\n<p>Here is the problem, though: it is not at all certain that the Internet is good for society. I believe it is — I just articulated a positive vision for the democratization enabled by Facebook advertising, to take but one small example — but there are obviously massive downsides as well. Moreover, many of those downsides seem to spring directly from the fact that people are connected: it&#8217;s not simply that it is trivial to find people who think the same as you, no matter how mistaken or depraved you might be, but it&#8217;s also trivial to find, observe, and fight with those who simply have a different set of values or circumstances. The end result feels like an acceleration of tribalism and polarization; it&#8217;s not only easy   to see and like your friends, but even easier to see and hate your enemies with your friends.</p>\n<p>This is, as I noted, an Internet problem — as Facebook is happy to tell you — but the truth is that Facebook, thanks to its uber-competent focus and execution on growth, effectively made the Internet problem a Facebook problem. Sure, you can make the case that had Facebook not pursued growth at all costs there would be another social network in its place — and frankly, I believe that Twitter gets off far too easy in discussions about deleterious impacts on society — but the reality is that Facebook did win, and just because some of its spoils are rotten doesn&#8217;t absolve the company of responsibility. If you are going to onboard all of humanity, you are going to get all of humanity&#8217;s problems.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Facebook pursued this growth without questioning if the obstacles it faced — the fact that &#8220;The natural state of the world is not connected. It is not unified.&#8221; — perhaps functioned as useful buffers; instead the company, particularly founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, was blinded by <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/manifestos-and-monopolies/\">a Messianic impulse</a> to create the conditions for global governance. Zuckerberg wrote in 2017&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/3707971095882612/\">Building Global Community</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  History is the story of how we&#8217;ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers — from tribes to cities to nations. At each step, we built social infrastructure like communities, media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn&#8217;t on our own. Today we are close to taking our next step. Our greatest opportunities are now global — like spreading prosperity and freedom, promoting peace and understanding, lifting people out of poverty, and accelerating science. Our greatest challenges also need global responses — like ending terrorism, fighting climate change, and preventing pandemics. Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.</p>\n<p>  This is especially important right now. Facebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community. When we began, this idea was not controversial. Every year, the world got more connected and this was seen as a positive trend. Yet now, across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection. There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone, and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.</p>\n<p>  This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact. I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology: &#8220;We always overestimate what we can do in two years, and we underestimate what we can do in ten years.&#8221; We may not have the power to create the world we want immediately, but we can all start working on the long term today. In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>What is particularly striking about this excerpt is the jump between the second paragraph, when Zuckerberg nods towards &#8220;questions&#8221; about reversing course, and the third paragraph which makes clear those questions were never seriously considered. And how could they be — &#8220;Connecting people. That’s our imperative. Because that’s what we do. We connect people.&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s combination of competence and drive ensured Internet problems were Facebook problems, and Zuckerberg&#8217;s missionary zeal didn&#8217;t give space to consider what might go wrong.</p>\n<p>This is the first, and perhaps most important, political problem Facebook has: the Internet causes real problems, and Facebook willingly made itself responsible for those problems, with no real understanding that the problems even existed.</p>\n<h4>Political Problem Two: Facebook&#8217;s Scapegoating</h4>\n<p>While I just linked Bosworth&#8217;s 2016 memo and Zuckerberg&#8217;s 2017 manifesto, it&#8217;s important to note that the latter was something new: Facebook explicitly committing itself to use its power to enact change. Before that nothing mattered but growth, which produced a very curious dynamic: Facebook had tremendous power but by-and-large declined to exercise it. This created the conditions for Donald Trump, which I explained in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/\">The Voters Decide</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Given their power over what users see Facebook could, if it chose, be the most potent political force in the world. Until, of course, said meddling was uncovered, at which point the service, having so significantly betrayed trust, would lose a substantial number of users and thus its lucrative and privileged place in advertising, leading to a plunge in market value. In short, there are no incentives for Facebook to explicitly favor any type of content beyond that which drives deeper engagement; all evidence suggests that is exactly what the service does.</p>\n<p>  Said reticence, though, creates a curious dynamic in politics in particular: there is no one dominant force when it comes to the dispersal of political information, and that includes the parties described in the previous section. Remember, in a Facebook world, information suppliers are modularized and commoditized as most people get their news from their feed.</p>\n<p>  This has two implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All news sources are competing on an equal footing; those controlled or bought by a party are not inherently privileged.</li>\n<li>The likelihood any particular message will “break out” is based not on who is propagating said message but on how many users are receptive to hearing it.

Moreover, it&#8217;s a dynamic that is even greater when combined: Trump famously used Facebook advertising <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/facebook-confirms-trumps-ads-bested-clintons-during-presidential-bid\">to far greater effect</a> than the Clinton campaign. And, at the same time, the New York Times, itself demoted to another attention seeker in a Facebook world, famously spent <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/\">huge amounts of time on Clinton&#8217;s emails</a>.</p>\n<p>What seems clear in retrospect is that the latter two entities made peace (and avoided introspection) by making Facebook the scapegoat for Trump&#8217;s election.

TikTok&#8217;s algorithm is far more addictive than Facebook&#8217;s, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-algorithm-sex-drugs-minors-11631052944\">dangerous for minors</a>, and YouTube has played perhaps the leading role in the spread of anti-vaccine information, but it is Facebook that gets all of the blame.</p>\n<h4>Political Problem Three: Facebook&#8217;s Power</h4>\n<p>There is another, more subtle problem related to the previous point: that Facebook power, which was latent in 2016, and which Zuckerberg made a bid to leverage for a utopian outcome in 2017, is increasingly irresistible to the powers that be. It has been fascinating watching the parade of Congressional hearings where Facebook has been harangued endlessly for not doing enough about misinformation by Democrats, while Republicans demand that Facebook stop censoring; both threaten regulation if the company doesn&#8217;t do better. Left unacknowledged by the left is that the company dramatically scaled up the number of people and money devoted to controlling what was allowed on the platform, and what was not; the right, meanwhile, apparently didn&#8217;t notice that <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/zuckerbergs-choice-zuckerbergs-power-zuckerbergs-conviction/\">Zuckerberg consistently stood up for Trump&#8217;s right to the platform</a>.<sup id=\"rf2-7756\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-political-problems/#fn2-7756\" title=\"More on January 6 below\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the same time, this too is a consequence of Facebook&#8217;s success with growth: centralized power is, as James Madison wrote in <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed47.asp\">Federalist No. 47</a>, inevitably leveraged for political gain:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.

In other words, to argue that it is not in Facebook&#8217;s interest as an ad platform to have angry political discussions doesn&#8217;t change the reality that having people interact more will entail more angry political discussions, amongst every other discussion that humans are liable to have.</p>\n<p>This also makes the case for why I do think the world would be better off were Facebook a much smaller company: its political problems — both for the company and for the world — are irrevocably tied to its size. Unfortunately the only means we have to break a company up — antitrust — don&#8217;t really apply; Facebook presents a societal problem, not a competitive one. Moreover, per political problem three, politicians don&#8217;t want a smaller Facebook; they want a compliant one.</p>\n<p>And so, the most likely outcome is that Facebook simply doubles down on information control, perhaps with some regulation that is far more likely to hinder new startups — stricter limits on data, for example, or increasing liability for user-generated content — than it is to materially harm Facebook. Not much will change, at least in the short term.</p>\n<h4>Politics and Internet 3.0</h4>\n<p>The capture of Facebook, though, will have consequences, in much the same vein as January&#8217;s industry-wide move against Trump; from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/\">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It turns out that when it comes to Information Technology, very little is settled; after decades of developing the Internet and realizing its economic potential, the entire world is waking up to the reality that the Internet is not simply a new medium, but a new maker of reality…</p>\n<p>  It is difficult to believe that the discussion of these implications will be reserved for posts on niche sites like Stratechery; the printing press transformed Europe from a continent of city-states loosely tied together by the Catholic Church, to a continent of nation-states with their own state churches. To the extent the Internet is as meaningful a shift — and I think it is! — is inversely correlated to how far along we are in the transformation that will follow — which is to say we have only gotten started. And, after last week, the world is awake to the stakes; politics — not economics — will decide, and be decided by, the Internet.</p>\n<p>  Here technology itself will return to the forefront: if the priority for an increasing number of citizens, companies, and countries is to escape centralization, then the answer will not be competing centralized entities, but rather a return to open protocols (crypto projects are one manifestation of this, but not the only ones). This is the only way to match and perhaps surpass the R&amp;D advantages enjoyed by centralized tech companies; open technologies can be worked on collectively, and forked individually, gaining both the benefits of scale and inevitability of sovereignty and self-determination.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The freedom of open source and the self-determination of crypto have always been attractive both technically and philosophically. Centralized platforms like Facebook, though, were just so <em>easy</em>. That, though, is why these political shifts matter: I understand the skepticism about crypto in particular, but I think critics who see only the scams or are focused on the challenges miss the fact that countries want to be sovereign and individuals want to be free. The more that U.S. tech companies are consumed by U.S. politics the more motivation there will be to pull the future forward.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-7756\"><p >This is where I am jealous of those who do nothing but attack Facebook; no nuance is, if nothing else, succinct.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-political-problems/#rf1-7756\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2-7756\"><p >More on January 6 below&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-political-problems/#rf2-7756\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 2.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>",
      "content_text": "Stratechery provides analysis of the strategy and business side of technology and media, and the impact of technology on society.\nSo begins my about page, and there is no company that expands to fill the space afforded by that description quite like Facebook. This does, on one hand, provide for endless amounts of content, much of which, frankly, I would like to move on from; it also means that writing about one aspect of Facebook is fraught with risk: just because you defend one aspect, or attack another, does not mean one is making a comment on the entirety of the corporate beast. Word limits, though, are a thing — yes, even on the web — which means that one can never cover all of one’s bases in any one individual article.1\nSo consider this piece self-service, of sorts: this Article will be what I link to in future posts with the caveat, “I’m not talking about Facebook political issues today; if you want my big-picture take follow this link.”\nWhich will take you here.\n\nA quick aside about timing: this post is being written the day after Frances Haugen appeared before Congress; I’m not writing about her testimony specifically, as I felt it covered very little new ground. Saying as much, though, did seem to prompt a lot of misunderstanding and, frustratingly, allegations of bad faith, which, optimistically, might have been alleviated by a link to an article like this one.\nWhat I did want to do is — word limit be damned — write a post about Facebook’s political problems, as I perceive them, in their entirety. I do think the media gets a lot of things wrong about Facebook, not because there aren’t problems, but because the problems are more profound than the issue of the day. So here’s my best shot.\nFacebook’s Benefit\nThis is perhaps an odd place to start, but it cuts to the core of why I do see real benefits to Facebook’s existence in the world, and is an important part of the trade-off calculations I make in the sections that follow.\nI believe that the economy of the future will, if we don’t stifle it along the way, look considerably different than the post World War II order dominated by large multinational corporations whose differentiation was predicated on distribution. Instead the future looks more like a rainforest, with platforms that span the globe and millions of niche businesses that sit on top.\nI am, given my career, biased in this regard, but the rise of platforms like Shopify, Etsy, Substack, and the App Store is evidence that new careers can be built and untold niches filled when the entire world is your addressable market. The challenge in a worldwide market, though, is finding the customers who are interested in the niche being filled; this is where Facebook’s ad offering is very much a platform in its own right.\nFacebook, via its integration with a host of third party sites and apps, makes it possible for those sites and apps to collectively understand and target prospective customers with the same sort of proficiency that first-data powerhouses like Google and Amazon do, and they don’t need to hold or understand any third-party data to do so. It is difficult to overstate what a big deal this is: suddenly a Shopify merchant can compete with Amazon, a D2C startup with Unilever, or a blog with the New York Times.\nMoreover, Facebook’s platform, unlike many of its competitors, is entirely automated and auction-driven; that means that small businesses have the same shot at customers as their far larger competitors do. Facebook is also very adept at simplifying the process (in exchange for more margin, of course): simply specify how much a customer is worth to you, and Facebook will deliver that customer. It’s an advertising platform that truly levels the playing field, and I think it is a very good thing for the world.\nPerceived Problem One: Privacy\nThe flipside of Facebook’s advertising platform is the reality that the company absolutely does ingest huge amounts of data. It is worth noting, though, that a big chunk of the most private human readable data is content that users give Facebook themselves when they use the site; Facebook combines that with all of the data it collects in all of those connected apps and sites — which are primarily about measuring conversions — in its Data Factory to create machine-learning driven profiles that undergird its advertising. What Facebook does not do is sell user data, not only because data undergirds its advertising business, but also because nearly all of that data would be unintelligible and worthless to any entity other than Facebook.\nAs I noted in Privacy Fundamentalism, it is tempting to imagine this data as being something akin to a file of your life just laying around for anyone to peruse; Apple has implied precisely this with some of its recent ads. The reality, though, is far more mundane: the nature of computers and the Internet is the spewing of data everywhere, and it is only in aggregate, in a data factory, than any insight from this collection of vectors can be derived, and only then in the context of a larger application like targeted advertising conducted at massive scale. It is exceedingly unlikely that Facebook could even make the data about any one individual readable by a human, and there is no incentive to do so; not only do third party apps and sites have no need nor desire for individual level data, neither do advertisers — Facebook’s entire value to both is as a matchmaker at scale.\nTo my mind, the reality of data on Facebook is well worth the trade-off for the value Facebook’s advertising delivers to niche-focused businesses. Moreover, I feel much better about Facebook as a data mediator than about modular advertising stacks where data really is bought and sold. I do understand that lots of folks disagree with me on this point, but again, everything is a trade-off, and I think this one is worth it.\nPerceived Problem Two: Competition\nThe core of my Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet is distinguishing between platforms and Aggregators; platforms are extremely valuable, because of the opportunities they enable, but are also more subject to abuse, because companies taking advantages of those opportunities are beholden to the platform. Aggregators, on the other hand, dominate their markets by controlling demand; suppliers are not locked in, but are rather seeking end users, who themselves can visit another website or open another app at any time. The societal value of Aggregators is lower than Platforms, but the extent to which they can inflict harm is more limited as well — competition really is just a click away.\nTo that end, the only extent to which Facebook is a potential antitrust concern is in terms of advertising, thanks to its massive amount of proprietary data and highly advanced data factory. At the same time, Facebook’s auction driven format ensures that Facebook is not gouging advertisers, and the effectively infinite potential inventory in digital means that competitors are not locked out from building competing products; the only scarcity is audience attention. Moreover, tradeoffs matter here as well: Facebook having extremely effective data is good for businesses on its platform, and there are privacy concerns with forcing Facebook to share.\nOn the consumer side, I simply don’t see any anticompetitive concerns at all. Consumers are not locked into a single communications app, but can and do multi-home, and can switch between competing services with a swipe. Facebook’s challenge is in continuing to keep users opening and using its apps, and there is plenty of evidence the company is struggling to do just that.\nA decade ago Facebook responded to this challenge by savvily buying upcoming communications apps like Instagram and WhatsApp; I do think that this reduced competition in the sector, particularly from an advertising perspective, and I do think there is a case for regulators to look much more critically at Aggregators buying other would-be Aggregators. That noted, in 2021 Facebook — even with Instagram and WhatsApp — faces more competition than ever before; the market worked, and regulators are very much on guard for similar purchases. Facebook is going to have to keep users with what it has, or builds.\nPolitical Problem One: Facebook’s Competence\nThese first three points, taken together, paint a picture of an exceptionally well-run company and a very attractive business; there is a reason why Facebook is worth around a trillion dollars. At the same time, it is that exceptional competence that starts to explain Facebook’s current political predicament.\nAndrew Bosworth, Facebook’s New CTO, wrote an internal memo in 2016 about Facebook’s commitment to growth that later leaked to BuzzFeed; it is essential to understanding Facebook:\n\n  We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly.\n  We connect people.\n  That can be good if they make it positive. Maybe someone finds love. Maybe it even saves the life of someone on the brink of suicide.\n  So we connect more people\n  That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.\n  And still we connect people.\n  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.\n  That isn’t something we are doing for ourselves. Or for our stock price (ha!). It is literally just what we do. We connect people. Period.\n  That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.\n  The natural state of the world is not connected. It is not unified. It is fragmented by borders, languages, and increasingly by different products. The best products don’t win. The ones everyone use win.\n  I know a lot of people don’t want to hear this. Most of us have the luxury of working in the warm glow of building products consumers love. But make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here. If you joined the company because it is doing great work, that’s why we get to do that great work. We do have great products but we still wouldn’t be half our size without pushing the envelope on growth. Nothing makes Facebook as valuable as having your friends on it, and no product decisions have gotten as many friends on as the ones made in growth. Not photo tagging. Not news feed. Not messenger. Nothing.\n  In almost all of our work, we have to answer hard questions about what we believe. We have to justify the metrics and make sure they aren’t losing out on a bigger picture. But connecting people. That’s our imperative. Because that’s what we do. We connect people.\n\nIn the seventeen years since Facebook was founded the number of people using the Internet has grown from around a billion people to around 4.5 billion people; in developed countries the Internet is close to being universal, but developing countries are steadily catching up:\n\nOf those 4.5 billion people, 3.5 billion use at at least one Facebook service on a monthly basis; 2.8 billion use at least one on a daily basis. That is exactly the sort of competence I was referring to above. As Bosworth notes, though, Facebook’s growth isn’t just about competence, but about a single-minded determination to do everything possible to make Facebook synonymous with the Internet.\nHere is the problem, though: it is not at all certain that the Internet is good for society. I believe it is — I just articulated a positive vision for the democratization enabled by Facebook advertising, to take but one small example — but there are obviously massive downsides as well. Moreover, many of those downsides seem to spring directly from the fact that people are connected: it’s not simply that it is trivial to find people who think the same as you, no matter how mistaken or depraved you might be, but it’s also trivial to find, observe, and fight with those who simply have a different set of values or circumstances. The end result feels like an acceleration of tribalism and polarization; it’s not only easy   to see and like your friends, but even easier to see and hate your enemies with your friends.\nThis is, as I noted, an Internet problem — as Facebook is happy to tell you — but the truth is that Facebook, thanks to its uber-competent focus and execution on growth, effectively made the Internet problem a Facebook problem. Sure, you can make the case that had Facebook not pursued growth at all costs there would be another social network in its place — and frankly, I believe that Twitter gets off far too easy in discussions about deleterious impacts on society — but the reality is that Facebook did win, and just because some of its spoils are rotten doesn’t absolve the company of responsibility. If you are going to onboard all of humanity, you are going to get all of humanity’s problems.\nSecondly, Facebook pursued this growth without questioning if the obstacles it faced — the fact that “The natural state of the world is not connected. It is not unified.” — perhaps functioned as useful buffers; instead the company, particularly founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, was blinded by a Messianic impulse to create the conditions for global governance. Zuckerberg wrote in 2017’s Building Global Community:\n\n  History is the story of how we’ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers — from tribes to cities to nations. At each step, we built social infrastructure like communities, media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn’t on our own. Today we are close to taking our next step. Our greatest opportunities are now global — like spreading prosperity and freedom, promoting peace and understanding, lifting people out of poverty, and accelerating science. Our greatest challenges also need global responses — like ending terrorism, fighting climate change, and preventing pandemics. Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.\n  This is especially important right now. Facebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community. When we began, this idea was not controversial. Every year, the world got more connected and this was seen as a positive trend. Yet now, across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection. There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone, and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\n  This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact. I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology: “We always overestimate what we can do in two years, and we underestimate what we can do in ten years.” We may not have the power to create the world we want immediately, but we can all start working on the long term today. In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.\n\nWhat is particularly striking about this excerpt is the jump between the second paragraph, when Zuckerberg nods towards “questions” about reversing course, and the third paragraph which makes clear those questions were never seriously considered. And how could they be — “Connecting people. That’s our imperative. Because that’s what we do. We connect people.” Facebook’s combination of competence and drive ensured Internet problems were Facebook problems, and Zuckerberg’s missionary zeal didn’t give space to consider what might go wrong.\nThis is the first, and perhaps most important, political problem Facebook has: the Internet causes real problems, and Facebook willingly made itself responsible for those problems, with no real understanding that the problems even existed.\nPolitical Problem Two: Facebook’s Scapegoating\nWhile I just linked Bosworth’s 2016 memo and Zuckerberg’s 2017 manifesto, it’s important to note that the latter was something new: Facebook explicitly committing itself to use its power to enact change. Before that nothing mattered but growth, which produced a very curious dynamic: Facebook had tremendous power but by-and-large declined to exercise it. This created the conditions for Donald Trump, which I explained in The Voters Decide:\n\n  Given their power over what users see Facebook could, if it chose, be the most potent political force in the world. Until, of course, said meddling was uncovered, at which point the service, having so significantly betrayed trust, would lose a substantial number of users and thus its lucrative and privileged place in advertising, leading to a plunge in market value. In short, there are no incentives for Facebook to explicitly favor any type of content beyond that which drives deeper engagement; all evidence suggests that is exactly what the service does.\n  Said reticence, though, creates a curious dynamic in politics in particular: there is no one dominant force when it comes to the dispersal of political information, and that includes the parties described in the previous section. Remember, in a Facebook world, information suppliers are modularized and commoditized as most people get their news from their feed.\n  This has two implications:\n\nAll news sources are competing on an equal footing; those controlled or bought by a party are not inherently privileged.\nThe likelihood any particular message will “break out” is based not on who is propagating said message but on how many users are receptive to hearing it. The power has shifted from the supply side to the demand side.\n\n  \n  This is a big problem for the parties as described in The Party Decides. Remember, in Noel and company’s description party actors care more about their policy preferences than they do voter preferences, but in an aggregated world it is voters aka users who decide which issues get traction and which don’t. And, by extension, the most successful politicians in an aggregated world are not those who serve the party but rather those who tell voters what they most want to hear.\n\nThese dynamics were in many respects the same as the advertising dynamics I described above: on Facebook both small companies and large companies have an equal shot at customers, and both Party insiders and complete outsiders have an equal shot at voters. Moreover, it’s a dynamic that is even greater when combined: Trump famously used Facebook advertising to far greater effect than the Clinton campaign. And, at the same time, the New York Times, itself demoted to another attention seeker in a Facebook world, famously spent huge amounts of time on Clinton’s emails.\nWhat seems clear in retrospect is that the latter two entities made peace (and avoided introspection) by making Facebook the scapegoat for Trump’s election. This was true in a way — Facebook created the conditions for someone like Trump to win — but the furor that followed suggested something much more explicit: within days the conversation was about Fake News and Russian influence being the key factors, not campaign mistakes and questionable coverage decisions, and certainly not the fundamental way that the media environment had changed.\nThat enmity has clearly persisted: what is striking about Facebook’s political problems in the United States is how they are not consistent across the world. Sure, Facebook fights its battles, with publishers in particular, but they’re mostly about money; it is in the U.S. where Facebook is, at least on one side of the aisle, uniquely despised, and held solely responsible for the Internet’s inherent issues. TikTok’s algorithm is far more addictive than Facebook’s, and dangerous for minors, and YouTube has played perhaps the leading role in the spread of anti-vaccine information, but it is Facebook that gets all of the blame.\nPolitical Problem Three: Facebook’s Power\nThere is another, more subtle problem related to the previous point: that Facebook power, which was latent in 2016, and which Zuckerberg made a bid to leverage for a utopian outcome in 2017, is increasingly irresistible to the powers that be. It has been fascinating watching the parade of Congressional hearings where Facebook has been harangued endlessly for not doing enough about misinformation by Democrats, while Republicans demand that Facebook stop censoring; both threaten regulation if the company doesn’t do better.

Moreover, per political problem three, politicians don’t want a smaller Facebook; they want a compliant one.\nAnd so, the most likely outcome is that Facebook simply doubles down on information control, perhaps with some regulation that is far more likely to hinder new startups — stricter limits on data, for example, or increasing liability for user-generated content — than it is to materially harm Facebook. Not much will change, at least in the short term.\nPolitics and Internet 3.0\nThe capture of Facebook, though, will have consequences, in much the same vein as January’s industry-wide move against Trump; from Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History:\n\n  It turns out that when it comes to Information Technology, very little is settled; after decades of developing the Internet and realizing its economic potential, the entire world is waking up to the reality that the Internet is not simply a new medium, but a new maker of reality…\n  It is difficult to believe that the discussion of these implications will be reserved for posts on niche sites like Stratechery; the printing press transformed Europe from a continent of city-states loosely tied together by the Catholic Church, to a continent of nation-states with their own state churches. To the extent the Internet is as meaningful a shift — and I think it is! — is inversely correlated to how far along we are in the transformation that will follow — which is to say we have only gotten started. And, after last week, the world is awake to the stakes; politics — not economics — will decide, and be decided by, the Internet.\n  Here technology itself will return to the forefront: if the priority for an increasing number of citizens, companies, and countries is to escape centralization, then the answer will not be competing centralized entities, but rather a return to open protocols (crypto projects are one manifestation of this, but not the only ones). This is the only way to match and perhaps surpass the R&D advantages enjoyed by centralized tech companies; open technologies can be worked on collectively, and forked individually, gaining both the benefits of scale and inevitability of sovereignty and self-determination.\n\nThe freedom of open source and the self-determination of crypto have always been attractive both technically and philosophically. Centralized platforms like Facebook, though, were just so easy. That, though, is why these political shifts matter: I understand the skepticism about crypto in particular, but I think critics who see only the scams or are focused on the challenges miss the fact that countries want to be sovereign and individuals want to be free. The more that U.S. tech companies are consumed by U.S. politics the more motivation there will be to pull the future forward.\nThis is where I am jealous of those who do nothing but attack Facebook; no nuance is, if nothing else, succinct. ↩More on January 6 below ↩",

However, the reality is that cable is both stronger than ever and poised for growth; the reasons why are instructive to not just tech industry observers, but to tech companies themselves.</p>\n<h4>The Creation of Cable</h4>\n<p>Robert J. Tarlton was 29 years old, married with a son, when he volunteered to fight in World War II; thanks to the fact he owned a shop in Lansford, Pennsylvania that sold radios, he ended up repairing them all across the European Theater, learning about not just reception but also transmission. After the war Tarlton re-opened his shop, when Motorola, one of his primary suppliers, came out with a new television.</p>\n<p>Tarlton was intrigued, but he had a geography problem; the nearest television station was in Philadelphia, 71 miles away; in the middle lie the Pocono Mountains, and mountains aren&#8217;t good for reception:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=640%2C519&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Lansford is separated from Philadelphia by the Pocono Mountains\" width=\"640\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8952\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=1024%2C830&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=768%2C622&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?resize=778%2C630&amp;ssl=1 778w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>It turned out, though, that some people living in Summit Hill, the next community over, could get the Philadelphia broadcast signal; that&#8217;s where Tarlton sold his first television sets. Of course Tarlton couldn&#8217;t demonstrate this new-fangled contraption; his shop was in Lansford, not Summit Hill. However, it was <em>close</em> to Summit Hill: what if Tarlton could place an antenna further up the mountain in Summit Hill and run a cable to his shop? Tarlton explained in <a href=\"https://www.cablecenter.org/the-barco-library/the-hauser-oral-history-project/t-v-listings/robert-tarlton-penn-state-collection\">an interview in 1986</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Lansford is an elongated town. It&#8217;s about a mile and a half long and there are about eight parallel streets bisected with cross streets about every 500 feet. There are no curves; everything is all laid out in a nice symmetrical pattern. Our business place was about three streets from the edge of Summit Hill and Lansford sits on kind of a slope. The edge of Lansford inclines from about a thousand feet above sea level to about fifteen hundred feet above sea level in Summit Hill. So to get television into our store, my father and I put an antenna partly up the mountain. No, we didn&#8217;t go all the way up, but we put up an antenna, kind of a crude arrangement, and then from tree to tree we strung a twin lead that was used in those days as a transmission line. We ran this twin lead, crossed a few streets, and into our store. And we had television.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The basic twin lead was barely functional, but that didn&#8217;t stop everyone from demanding a television with a haphazard wire to their house; Tarlton realized that new coaxial cable amplifiers designed for a single property could be chained together, re-amplifying the signal so it could reach multiple properties. After getting all of the other electronics retailers on board — Tarlton knew that a clear signal would sell more TV sets, but that everyone needed to use the same system — the first commercial cable system was born, and it sold itself. Tarlton reflected:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  You didn&#8217;t have to advertise. You had to keep your door locked because the people were clamoring for service. They wanted cable service. You certainly didn&#8217;t have to advertise.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>People couldn&#8217;t get enough TV; Tarlton explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Cable is dependent upon advances in technology because people who originally saw one channel wanted to see the second channel, wanted to see the third, and after you had five, they wanted more. So it was a case of more begets more. At one time three channels seemed to be quite sufficient but when we added one more channel, it created a new interest in the cable system. People then had variety. They had alternatives. At one time later five channels seemed enough. As a matter of fact, a man who is often quoted, former FCC Commissioner Ken Cox, said that five channels was enough, and that&#8217;s quite a story in itself. The engineers were able to continually refine equipment to add more channels…All these technical advances‑‑continuing advances, automatic gain control, automatic temperature compensation, etc. have made cable what it is today.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the most important technological developments was satellite: now cable systems could get signals both more reliably and from far further away; this actually flipped geography on its head. Tarlton said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  At that time we went to the highest possible point to look to the transmitter. Today with satellites, we go to the lowest possible point because we don&#8217;t want the interference from other signals. So it is ironic that we have changed so much from what we used to do.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Within these snippets is everything that makes the cable business so compelling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cable is in high demand because it provides the means to get what customers most highly value.</li>\n<li>Cable works best both technologically and financially when it has a geographic monopoly.</li>\n<li>Cable creates demand for new supply; technological advances enable more supply, which creates more demand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s that last bit about satellites being better on lower ground that stands out to me, though: as long as you control the wires into people&#8217;s houses you can and should be pragmatic about everything else.</p>\n<h4>Cable&#8217;s Evolution</h4>\n<p>Tarlton would go on to work for a company called Jerrold Electronics, which pivoted its entire business to create equipment for cities that wanted to emulate Lansford&#8217;s system; Tarlton would lead the installation of cable systems across the United States, which for the first two decades of cable mostly retransmitted broadcast television.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned satellite, though, led to the creation of national TV stations, first HBO, and then WTCG, an independent television station in Atlanta, Georgia, owned by Ted Turner. Turner realized he could buy programming at local rates, but sell advertising at national rates via cable operators eager to feed their customers&#8217; hunger for more stations. Turner soon launched a cable only channel devoted to nothing but news; he called it the Cable News Network — CNN for short (WTCG would later be renamed TBS).</p>\n<p>Jerrold Electronics, meanwhile, spun off one of the cable systems it built in Tupelo, Mississippi to an entrepreneur named Ralph Roberts; Roberts proceeded to systematically buy up community cable systems across the country, moving the company&#8217;s headquarters to Philadelphia and renaming it to Comcast Corporation (Roberts would eventually hand the business off to his son, Brian). Consolidation in the provision of cable service proceeded in conjunction with consolidation in the production of content, an inevitable outcome of the virtuous cycle I noted above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cable companies acquired customers who wanted access to content</li>\n<li>Studios created content that customers demanded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more customers that a cable company served, the stronger their negotiating position with content providers; the more studios and types of content that a content provider controlled the stronger their negotiating position with cable providers. The end result were a few dominant cable providers (Comcast, Charter, Cox, Altice, Mediacom) and a few dominant content companies (Disney, Viacom, NBC Universal, Time Warner, Fox), tussling back-and-forth over a very profitable pie.</p>\n<p>Then came Netflix, and tech industry crowing about cord cutting.</p>\n<p>Netflix and other streaming services were obviously bad for television: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/\">they did the same job but in a completely different way</a>, leveraging the Internet to provide content on-demand, unconstrained by the linear nature of television that was a relic of cable&#8217;s origin with broadcast TV. Here, though, cable&#8217;s ownership of the wires was an effective hedge: the same wires that delivered linear TV delivered packet-based Internet content.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this didn&#8217;t simply mean that cable&#8217;s TV losses were made up for by Internet service: Internet service was much higher margin because companies like Comcast didn&#8217;t need to negotiate with a limited number of content providers; everything on the Internet was free. This has meant that the fortunes of cable companies has boomed over the last decade, even as cord-cutting has cut the cable TV business by about a third.</p>\n<p>Cable companies today, though, are yet another category down from their pandemic highs, thanks to fear that the broadband growth story is mostly over; fiber offers better performance, 5G opens the door to wireless in the home, and anyone who doesn&#8217;t have broadband now is probably never going to get it. I think, though, this underrates the strategic positioning of cable companies, and ignores the industry&#8217;s demonstrated ability to adapt to new strategic environments.</p>\n<h4>The Wireless Opportunity</h4>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204826704577074103860244794\">Wall Street Journal</a> in 2011:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Verizon Wireless will pay $3.6 billion to buy wireless spectrum licenses from a group of cable-television companies, bringing an end to their years-long flirtation with setting up its own cellphone service. The sellers—Comcast Time Warner Cable Inc. and Bright House Networks—acquired the spectrum in a government auction in 2006 and now will turn it over to the country&#8217;s biggest wireless carrier at more than a 50% markup. While cable companies have dabbled with wireless, the spectrum has largely sat around unused, prompting years of speculation about the industry&#8217;s intentions…</p>\n<p>  Under the deal, Verizon Wireless will be able to sell its service in the cable companies&#8217; stores. The carrier, in turn, will be able to sell the cable companies&#8217; broadband, video and voice services in its stores. Verizon&#8217;s FiOS service only reaches 14% of U.S. households, according to Bernstein Research. In four years&#8217; time, the cable companies will have the option to buy service on Verizon&#8217;s network on a wholesale basis and then resell it under their own brand.</p>\n<p>  The joint marketing arrangement &#8220;amounts to a partnership between formerly mortal enemies,&#8221; wrote Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in a research note.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moffett would later partner with Michael Nathanson to form their own independent research firm (called <a href=\"https://www.moffettnathanson.com/?Section=Media%20/Telecom\">MoffettNathanson</a>, natch); Moffett released an updated report last month that explained how that Verizon deal ended up playing out:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When Comcast and Time Warner Cable sold their AWS-1 spectrum to Verizon back in 2011, they believed at the time that they were walking away from ever becoming facilities-based wireless players. They therefore viewed it as imperative that the sale come with an MVNO agreement with Verizon to compensate for that forfeiture. They got precisely what they wanted, an MVNO contract with Verizon that was described at the time as &#8220;<em>perpetual and irrevocable</em>&#8220;…</p>\n<p>  It took another six years after that transaction before Comcast finally launched Xfinity Mobile in mid-2017. Charter [which merged with Time Warner Cable, acquiring the latter&#8217;s MVNO rights] followed suit a year later…in four short years, the Cable operators have become the fastest growing wireless providers in the country, accounting for nearly 30% of wireless industry net additions. Cable&#8217;s 7.7 million mobile lines represent ~2.5% of the U.S. mobile phone market (including prepaid and postpaid phones).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Moffett notes, this growth is particularly impressive given that most cable companies couldn&#8217;t feasibly offer family plans under the terms of the original deal, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-wireless-plan-faces-hurdle-1438299616\">which was negotiated before such a concept even existed</a>; the deal has been re-negotiated, though, and almost certainly to the cable companies&#8217; advantage: if Verizon is going to lose customers to an MVNO, it would surely prefer said MVNO be on their network; this means that the cable companies have negotiating leverage.</p>\n<p>What, though, makes the cable companies such effective MVNOs? One of the most interesting parts of Moffett&#8217;s note was proprietary data about the amount of data used by cellular subscribers; it turns out that cable MVNO customers are far more likely to consume data over WiFi, perhaps because of cable company out-of-home WiFi hot spots. This could become even more favorable in the future as cable companies build out Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) service, particularly in dense areas where cable companies have wires from which to hang CBRS transmitters. Moffett writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In a perfect world, Cable will offload traffic onto their own facilities where doing so is cheap (high density, high use locations) and leave to Verizon the burden of carrying traffic where doing so is/would be expensive. Because the MVNO agreement is &#8220;perpetual and irrevocable,&#8221; and is based on <em>average</em> prices (i.e., the same price everywhere, whether easy or hard to reach), Cable is presented with a perfect ROI arbitrage; they can take the high ROI parts of the network for themselves, and leave the low ROI parts of the network to their MVNO host… all without sacrificing <em>anything</em> with respect to their national coverage footprint.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>One can understand why Verizon gave the cable companies these rights in 2011; the phone company desperately needed spectrum, and besides, everyone knew that MVNOs could never be economically competitive with their wholesale providers, who were the ones that actually made the investments in the network.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing, though: cable companies had their own massive build-out, one that was both much older in its origins and, because it connected the house, actually carried more data. This was to the benefit of Verizon and other cellular providers, of course: a Verizon iPhone uses WiFi at home just as much as a Comcast iPhone does; here, though, it was cable that had internet economics on its side: there is no competitive harm in giving equal access to an abundant resource; it is cellular access that is scarce, which means that the cable companies&#8217; MVNO deal, in conjunction with their out-of-home Internet access options, gives them a meaningful advantage.</p>\n<h4>Customer Acquisition</h4>\n<p>Moffett spends less time on customer acquisition; anecdotally speaking, it&#8217;s clear that Charter&#8217;s Spectrum, which provides the cable service I consume (via the excellent <a href=\"https://getchannels.com/\">Channels</a> application), is pushing wireless service hard: phones are front-and-center in their stores, and Spectrum wireless commercials fill local inventory. Moreover, this is a well-trodden playbook: cable companies came to dominate the fixed line phone service business simply because it was easier to get your TV, Internet, and phone all in the same place (and of those, the most important was TV, and now Internet); it&#8217;s always easier to upsell an existing subscriber than it is to acquire a new one.</p>\n<p>Of course cable companies long handled customer acquisition for content creators — that was the cable bundle in a nutshell. What is interesting is how this customer acquisition capability is attractive to the companies undoing that bundle: Netflix, for example, put its service on Comcast&#8217;s set-top boxes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/5/12096380/comcast-to-let-netflix-onto-its-x1-platform-which-is-a-very-big-deal\">in 2016</a>, and made a deal for Comcast to sell its service <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-to-bundle-rival-netflix-in-plans-1523624402\">in 2018</a>. I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/netflixs-earnings-and-the-video-value-chain-the-conditions-of-aggregation-comcast-and-netflix-and-the-new-bundle/\">a Daily Update</a> at the time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Netflix, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/netflix-goes-global-iphone-worry/\">laddering up</a> again: the company doesn&#8217;t actually need a billing relationship with end users, it just needs ever more end users (along with the data about what they watch) to spread its fixed content costs more widely; the company said in its <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.com/static-files/419958ac-5fd7-4bcd-9fb1-ebca445a9016\">shareholder letter</a> that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    These relationships allow our partners to attract more customers and to upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while we benefit from more reach, awareness and often, less friction in the signup and payment process. We believe that the lower churn in these bundles offsets the lower Netflix ASP.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  What is particularly interesting is that this arrangement moves the industry closer to the endgame I predicted in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/\">The Great Unbundling</a>…\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Endgame&#8221; was a bit strong: that Article was, as the title says, about unbundling; one of my arguments was that the traditional cable TV bundle would become primarily anchored on live sports and news, while most scripted content went to streaming. That is very much the case today (TBS, for example, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/tnt-tbs-scripted-programming-development-scrapped-warner-bros-discovery-1235241348/\">is abandoning scripted content</a>, while becoming ever more reliant on sports). What was a mistake was insinuating that this was the &#8220;end&#8221;; after all, as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling\">Jim Barksdale famously observed</a>, the next step after unbundling is bundling.</p>\n<p>To that end, Netflix + Xfinity TV service was a bundle of sorts, but the real takeaway was that Comcast was fine with being simply an Internet provider (which ended up helping with TV margins, since cable companies mostly gave up on fighting to keep cord cutters). Shortly after the Netflix deal Comcast launched <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-xfinity-flex-internet-customers-free-4k-streaming\">Xfinity Flex</a>, a free 4K streaming box for Internet-only subscribers that included a storefront for buying streaming services (which would be billed by Comcast). You can even subscribe to digital MVPDs <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/youtube-tv-launches-on-xfinity-flex\">like YouTube TV</a>!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-xfinity-flex-internet-customers-free-4k-streaming\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=640%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The free Xfinity Flex streaming box\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8951\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=1024%2C609&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?resize=1060%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1060w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cable-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first takeaway of an offering like Xfinity Flex ties into the wireless point: cable companies already have a billing relationship with the customer — because they provide the most essential utility for accessing what is most important to said customer — which makes them particularly effective at customer acquisition. That is why Netflix, YouTube, etc. are all willing to pay a revenue share for the help.</p>\n<h4>The Great Rebundling?</h4>\n<p>The second takeaway, though, is that the cable companies are better suited than almost anyone else to rebundle for real. Imagine a &#8220;streaming bundle&#8221; that includes Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, etc., available for a price that is less than the sum of its parts. Sounds too good to be true, right? After all, this kind of sounds like what Apple was envisioning for Apple TV (the app) before Netflix spoiled the fun; I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-should-buy-netflix/\">Apple Should Buy Netflix</a> in 2016:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple’s desire to be “the one place to access all of your television” implies the demotion of Netflix to just another content provider, right alongside its rival HBO and the far more desperate networks who lack any sort of customer relationship at all. It is directly counter to the strategy that has gotten Netflix this far — owning the customer relationship by delivering a superior customer experience — and while Apple may wish to pursue the same strategy, the company has no leverage to do so. Not only is the Apple TV just another black box that connects to your TV (that is also the most expensive), it also, conveniently for Netflix, has a (relatively) open app platform: Netflix can deliver their content on their terms on Apple’s hardware, and there isn’t much Apple can do about it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Six years on and Netflix is in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/netflix-earnings-netflixs-struggling-growth-drivers-netflix-to-explore-advertising/\">a much different place</a>, not only struggling for new customers but also dealing with elevated churn. Owning the customer may be less important than simply having more customers, particularly if those customers are much less likely to churn. After all, that&#8217;s one of the advantages of a bundle: instead of your streaming service needing to produce compelling content every single month, you can work as a team to keep customers on board with the bundle.</p>\n<p>The key point about a bundle, <a href=\"https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling\">as longtime YouTube executive and Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra has written</a>, is that <a href=\"https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling/myth-4-6\">it minimizes SuperFan overlap while maximizing CasualFan overlap</a>; in other words, effective bundles have more disparate content that you are vaguely interested in, instead of a relatively small amount of focused content that you care about intensely. This makes the bundle concept even more compelling to new entrants in the streaming wars, who may not have as large of libraries as Netflix, and certainly don&#8217;t have as many subscribers over which to spread their content costs.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the fact that the streaming services have largely done their damage to traditional TV, leaving the cable TV bundle as the sports and news bundle, means it is actually viable to create a lower-priced bundle than what was previously available (if you don&#8217;t want sports). After all, you&#8217;re not cannibalizing TV, but rather bringing together what has long since been broken off (unbundling then bundling!).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This isn&#8217;t something that is going to happen overnight: despite the fact that <a href=\"https://cdixon.org/2012/07/08/how-bundling-benefits-sellers-and-buyers\">bundles are good for everyone</a> it is hard to get independents into a bundle as long as they are growing; Netflix&#8217;s recent struggles are encouraging in this regard, particularly if other streaming services start to face similar headwinds. Moreover, cable companies are not the only entities that will seek to pull something like this off: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Roku already make money from revenue shares on streaming subscriptions they sell; all of them sell devices that can be used as interfaces for selling a bundle. And, of course, there are more Internet providers than just the cable companies: there is fiber, wireless, and even Starlink.</p>\n<p>The breadth of the cable company bundle, though, is unmatched: not only might it include streaming services, but also linear TV; more than that, this is the company selling you Internet access, and increasingly wireless phone service. That gives even more latitude for discounts, and perks like no data caps on streamed content, not just at home but also on your phone.</p>\n<p>All of these advantages go back to Robert J. Tarlton and Lansford, Pennsylvania. A recurring point on Stratechery this past year has been the durability and long-term potential inherent in technology rooted in physical space. I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/\">Digital Advertising in 2022</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Real power in technology comes from rooting the digital in something physical: for Amazon that is its fulfillment centers and logistics on the e-commerce side, and its data centers on the cloud side. For Microsoft it is its data centers and its global sales organization and multi-year relationships with basically every enterprise on earth. For Apple it is the iPhone, and for Google is is Android and its mutually beneficial relationship with Apple (this is less secure than Android, but that is why Google is paying an estimated $15 billion annually — and growing — to keep its position). Facebook benefited tremendously from being just an app, but the freedom of movement that entailed meant taking a dependency on iOS and Android, and Apple has exploited that dependency in part, if not yet in full.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>For cable companies, power comes from a wire; it would certainly be ironic if the cord-cutting trumpeted by tech resulted in cable having even more leverage over customers and their wallets than the pre-Internet era.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Beyond Aggregation: Amazon as a Service</title>\n\t\t<link>https://stratechery.com/2022/beyond-aggregation-amazon-as-a-service/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 14:29:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stratechery.com/?p=8865</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Amazon's new Buy With Prime announced the arrival of Amazon Logistics as a Service, and is a big red flag for Shopify.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five months and $134 billion in market cap ago (before the stock slipped by 68%), Bloomberg Businessweek purported to explain <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-23/shopify-amazon-retail-rivalry-heats-up-with-covid-sparked-online-shopping-booma\">How Shopify Outfoxed Amazon to Become the Everywhere Store</a>. One of the key parts of the story was how Shopify pulled one over on Amazon seven years ago:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  An even more critical event came a few months after the IPO. Amazon also operated a service that let independent merchants run their websites, called Webstore. Bang &amp; Olufsen, Fruit of the Loom, and Lacoste were among the 80,000 or so companies that used it to run their online shops. If he wanted to, Bezos surely had the resources and engineering prowess to crush Shopify and steal its momentum.</p>\n<p>  But Amazon execs from that time admit that the Webstore service wasn’t very good, and its sales were dwarfed by all the rich opportunities the company was seeing in its global marketplace, where customers shop on Amazon.com, not on merchant websites…In late 2015, in one of Bezos’ periodic purges of underachieving businesses, he agreed to close Webstore. Then, in a rare strategic mistake that’s likely to go down in the annals of corporate blunders, Amazon sent its customers to Shopify and proclaimed publicly that the Canadian company was its preferred partner for the Webstore diaspora. In exchange, Shopify agreed to offer Amazon Pay to its merchants and let them easily list their products on Amazon’s marketplace. Shopify also paid Amazon $1 million—a financial arrangement that’s never been previously reported.</p>\n<p>  Bezos and his colleagues believed that supporting small retailers and their online shops was never going to be a large, profitable business. They were wrong—small online retailers generated about $153 billion in sales in 2020, according to AMI Partners. “Shopify made us look like fools,” says the former Amazon executive.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If only we could all make such excellent mistakes; Amazon&#8217;s move looks like a strategic masterstroke.</p>\n<h4>Shopify&#8217;s Revenue Streams</h4>\n<p>Three major things have changed, will change, or should change about Shopify&#8217;s business in the years since the company made that deal with Amazon.</p>\n<p>What has changed is the composition of Shopify&#8217;s business. While the company started out with a SaaS model, the business has transformed into a commission-based one:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=640%2C389&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify&#039;s two revenue streams\" width=\"640\" height=\"389\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8866\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=1024%2C623&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?resize=1035%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1035w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AaaS-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;Subscription Solutions&#8221; are Shopify&#8217;s platform fees, including the cost to use the platform (or upgrade to the company&#8217;s Pro offering), commissions from the sales of themes and apps, and domain name registration. &#8220;Merchant Solutions&#8221;, meanwhile, are all of the fees that are generated from ongoing sales; the largest part of this are payment processing fees from Shopify Payments, but other fees include advertising revenue, referral fees, Shopify Shipping, etc.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the shipping part that is line for big changes: while Shopify first announced the Shopify Fulfillment Network <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">back in 2019</a>, it is only recently that the company has committed to actually building out important pieces of said network on its own, the better to compete with Amazon&#8217;s full-scale offering.</p>\n<p>As for what <em>should</em> change, I argued <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/\">back in February</a> that Shopify needed to build out an advertising network; this recommendation is more pertinent than ever, in large part because the second item on this list might be in big trouble.</p>\n<h4>Buy With Prime</h4>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-coming-to-other-online-sites-11650556838\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Amazon.com Inc. is extending some of the offerings of its popular Prime membership program to merchants off its platform with a new service that embeds the online retailing giant’s payment and fulfillment options onto third-party sites. Called Buy with Prime, the service will allow merchants to show the Prime logo and offer Amazon’s speedy delivery options on products listed on their own websites…</p>\n<p>  The company said the Buy with Prime offer will be rolled out by invitation only through 2022 for those who already sell on Amazon and use the company’s fulfillment services. Later, Amazon plans to extend Buy with Prime to other merchants, including those that don’t sell on its platform. Participating merchants will use the Prime logo and display expected delivery dates on eligible products. Checkout will go through Amazon Pay and the company’s fulfillment network. Amazon will also manage free returns for eligible orders.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a move that you could see coming for a long time; back in 2016 I wrote an article called <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/\">The Amazon Tax</a> that explained that the best way to understand Amazon as a whole was to understand Amazon Web Services (AWS):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The “primitives” model modularized Amazon’s infrastructure, effectively transforming raw data center components into storage, computing, databases, etc. which could be used on an ad-hoc basis not only by Amazon’s internal teams but also outside developers:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=640%2C461&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The AWS Layer\" width=\"640\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2073\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=1024%2C738&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?resize=874%2C630&amp;ssl=1 874w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-274.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  This AWS layer in the middle has several key characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS has massive fixed costs but benefits tremendously from economies of scale</li>\n<li>The cost to build AWS was justified because the first and best customer is Amazon’s e-commerce business</li>\n<li>AWS’s focus on “primitives” meant it could be sold as-is to developers beyond Amazon, increasing the returns to scale and, by extension, deepening AWS’ moat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  This last point was a win-win: developers would have access to enterprise-level computing resources with zero up-front investment; Amazon, meanwhile, would get that much more scale for a set of products for which they would be the first and best customer.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I noted in that article, the AWS model was being increasingly applied to e-commerce as Amazon shifted from being a retailer to being a services provider:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Prime is a super experience with superior prices and superior selection, and it too feeds into a scale play. The result is a business that looks like this:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=640%2C461&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The Transformation of Amazon’s E-Commerce Business\" width=\"640\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2072\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=1024%2C738&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?resize=874%2C630&amp;ssl=1 874w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?w=1876&amp;ssl=1 1876w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stratechery-Year-One-275.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  That is, of course, the same structure as AWS — and it shares similar characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E-commerce distribution has massive fixed costs but benefits tremendously from economies of scale</li>\n<li>The cost to build-out Amazon’s fulfillment centers was justified because the first and best customer is Amazon’s e-commerce business</li>\n<li>That last bullet point may seem odd, but in fact 40% of Amazon’s sales (on a unit basis) are sold by 3rd-party merchants; most of these merchants leverage Fulfilled-by-Amazon, which means their goods are stored in Amazon’s fulfillment centers and covered by Prime. This increases the return to scale for Amazon’s fulfillment centers, increases the value of Prime, and deepens Amazon’s moat</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My prediction in that Article was that Amazon&#8217;s burgeoning logistics business would eventually follow the same path:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It seems increasingly clear that Amazon intends to repeat the model when it comes to logistics…how might this play out? Well, start with the fact that Amazon itself would be this logistics network’s first-and-best customer, just as was the case with AWS. This justifies the massive expenditure necessary to build out a logistics network that competes with UPS, Fedex, et al, and most outlets are framing these moves as a way for Amazon to rein in shipping costs and improve reliability, especially around the holidays.</p>\n<p>  However, I think it is a mistake to think that Amazon will stop there: just as they have with AWS and e-commerce distribution I expect the company to offer its logistics network to third parties, which will increase the returns to scale, and, by extension, deepen Amazon’s eventual moat\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today Amazon&#8217;s logistics is massive and fully integrated from the fulfillment center to the doorstep, even though it only serves Amazon; the obvious next step is opening it up to non-Amazon retailers, and that is exactly what is happening.</p>\n<h4>Beyond Aggregation</h4>\n<p>At first glance, this might seem like a bit of a surprise; after all, Stratechery is well known for describing <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>, which is predicated on controlling demand. In the case of Amazon that has meant controlling the website where customers order goods — Amazon.com — even if those goods were sold by 3rd-party merchants. Why would Amazon give that up?</p>\n<p>The reasoning is straightforward: while Amazon has had Aggregator characteristics, the company&#8217;s business model and differentiation has always been rooted in the real world, which, by extension, means it is not an Aggregator at all. I noted in 2017&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/\">Defining Aggregators</a> that Aggregators benefit from zero marginal costs, which only describes a certain set of digital businesses like Google and Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Companies traditionally have had to incur (up to) three types of marginal costs when it comes to serving users/customers directly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of goods sold (COGS), that is, the cost of producing an item or providing a service</li>\n<li>Distribution costs, that is the cost of getting an item to the customer (usually via retail) or facilitating the provision of a service (usually via real estate)</li>\n<li>Transaction costs, that is the cost of executing a transaction for a good or service, providing customer service, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  Aggregators incur none of these costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The goods “sold” by an Aggregator are digital and thus have zero marginal costs (they may, of course, have significant fixed costs)</li>\n<li>These digital goods are delivered via the Internet, which results in zero distribution costs</li>\n<li>Transactions are handled automatically through automatic account management, credit card payments, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  This characteristic means that businesses like Apple hardware and Amazon’s traditional retail operations are not Aggregators; both bear significant costs in serving the marginal customer (and, in the case of Amazon in particular, have achieved such scale that the service’s relative cost of distribution is actually a moat).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s control of demand has been — and will continue to be — a tremendous advantage; Amazon not only has power over its suppliers, but it also gets all of the relevant data from consumers, which it can feed into a self-contained ad platform that is untouched by regulation from either governments or Apple.</p>\n<p>At the same time, limiting a business to customer touchpoints that you control means limiting your overall addressable market. This may not matter in markets where there are network effects (which means you appeal to everyone) and you are an Aggregator dealing with zero marginal costs (and thus can realistically cover every consumer); in the case of e-commerce, though, Amazon will never be the only option, particularly given <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">The Anti-Amazon Alliance</a> working hard to reach consumers.</p>\n<p>A core part of the Anti-Amazon Alliance are companies that have invested in brands that attract customers on their own; these companies don&#8217;t need to be on Amazon fighting to be the answer to generic search terms, but can rather drive customers to their own Shopify-powered websites both organically and via paid advertising (Facebook is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/\">a huge player</a> in the Anti-Amazon Alliance). Still, every customer that visits these websites has an Amazon-driven expectation in terms of shipping; Shippo CEO Laura Behrens Wu told me in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/an-update-on-the-founder-series-shopify-partners-with-shippo-an-interview-with-shippo-founder-laura-behrens-wu/\">a Stratechery interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Consumers have those expectations from Amazon that shipping should be free, it should be two days, and whatever those are expectations are, returns should be free. That is still carried over when I’m buying on this branded website. If the expectations are not met, consumers decide to buy somewhere else…Merchants are constantly trying to play catch up, whatever Amazon is doing they need to follow suit.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now Amazon has — or soon will have, in the case of Shopify-only merchants — a solution: the best way to get an Amazon-like shipping experience is to ship via Amazon. And, in contrast to the crappy Webstore product, you can keep using Shopify and its ecosystem for your website. Amazon may have given away business to Shopify in 2015, but that doesn&#8217;t much matter if said business ends up being a commoditized complement to Amazon&#8217;s true differentiation in logistics. That business, thanks to the sheer expense necessary to build it out, has a nearly impregnable moat that is not only attractive to all of the businesses competing to be consumer touchpoints — thus increasing Amazon&#8217;s addressable market — but is also one that sees its moat deepen the larger it becomes.</p>\n<h4>Shopify&#8217;s Predicament and Amazon&#8217;s Opportunity</h4>\n<p>The reason this announcement is so damaging to Shopify goes back to the transformation in the company&#8217;s revenue I charted above: Amazon&#8217;s shipping solution requires the customer to pay with Amazon; I love Shop Pay&#8217;s checkout process, but it&#8217;s not as if I don&#8217;t have an Amazon account with all of my relevant details already included, and I absolutely trust Amazon&#8217;s shipping more than I do whatever option some Shopify merchant offers me. If I had a choice I&#8217;m taking the Amazon option every time.</p>\n<p>Granted, I may not be representative; I&#8217;m a bit of a special case <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-relentless-jeff-bezos/\">given where I live</a>. What is worth noting, though, is that every transaction that Amazon processes is one <em>not</em> processed by Shopify, which again, is the company&#8217;s primary revenue driver. Moreover, the more volume that Amazon processes, the more difficult it will be for Shopify to get their own shipping solution to scale. This endangers the company&#8217;s current major initiative.</p>\n<p>That is why <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/\">I think the company needs to think more deeply than ever about advertising</a>: the implication of Amazon being willing to be a services provider and not necessarily an Aggregator is that Amazon is surrendering some number of customer touchpoints to competitors; to put it another way, Amazon is actually making competitive customer touchpoints better — touchpoints that Shopify controls. Shopify ought to leverage that control.</p>\n<p>That noted, there is a potential wrench in this plan: if Shopify doesn&#8217;t own payment processing, will they have sufficient data to build a competitive conversion-data-driven advertising product? Amazon — and Apple — would likely argue that that data is Amazon&#8217;s, but the merchant will obviously know what is going on (by the same token, will Amazon be able to tie this off-platform conversion data back to its own advertising product? It&#8217;s not clear what would stop them).</p>\n<p>Shopify has two additional saving graces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the fact that Amazon will be able to collect data is a big reason for many merchants not to use Amazon&#8217;s new offering. Shopify&#8217;s offering will always be differentiated in this regard.</li>\n<li>Second, as the announcement noted, this is going to take Amazon a year or two to fully roll out, and lots of stuff can change in the meantime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, while AWS has always been excellent at serving external customers — which it did before Amazon.com ever actually moved over — Amazon&#8217;s off-Amazon.com merchant offerings have never been particularly successful (including the aforementioned Webstores).</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I think it&#8217;s meaningful that &#8220;Buy With Prime&#8221; is the first major initiative of new CEO Andy Jassy&#8217;s regime; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an accident that it is so clearly inspired by AWS. AWS&#8217;s strength is its focus on infrastructure at scale; successfully moving e-commerce beyond aggregation to the same type of service business model would put his stamp on the company in a meaningful way, and, contra that quote in Bloomberg Businessweek, mark Jassy as nobody&#8217;s fool.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Back to the Future of Twitter</title>\n\t\t<link>https://stratechery.com/2022/back-to-the-future-of-twitter/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2022 15:21:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stratechery.com/?p=8837</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Twitter should go private and return to its pre-2012 approach of being a centralized service with third-party clients.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk wrote in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922045641/tm2212748d1_sc13da.htm#ex-b_001\">a letter to Twitter&#8217;s board</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.</p>\n<p>  However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.

Does Musk have the cash available to buy Twitter, and would the Twitter board accept his offer (no on the latter, but more on this below)?</p>\n<p>The most interesting question of all, though, is the last paragraph: what potential does Musk see, and could he unlock it?

That raises the question, though, what is Twitter: is it a website or an app, or something different?</p>\n<p>The answer, of course, is &#8220;All of the above&#8221;, but it&#8217;s worth being clear about the different pieces that make up Twitter; &#8220;Jin&#8221; made this illustration <a href=\"https://medium.com/interviewnoodle/twitter-system-architecture-8dafce16aec4\">on Medium</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/interviewnoodle/twitter-system-architecture-8dafce16aec4\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-1.png?resize=640%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Twitter&#039;s architecture\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8838\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-1.png?resize=1024%2C604&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-1.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-1.png?resize=768%2C453&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-1.png?resize=1068%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1068w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Twitter is actually a host of microservices, including a user service (for listing a user&#8217;s timeline), a graph service (for tracking your network), a posting service (for posting new tweets), a profile service (for user profiles), a timeline service (for presenting your timeline), etc.; the architecture to tie all of these together and operate at scale all around the world is suitably complex.</p>\n<p>The key thing to note, though, is that only the green boxes in the diagram above are actually user-facing; a dramatically simplified version of Twitter, that condenses all of those internal services to a big blue &#8220;Twitter&#8221; box and focuses on the green interfaces might look something like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-2.png?resize=640%2C511&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A dramatic over-simplification of Twitter&#039;s architecture\" width=\"640\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8840\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-2.png?resize=1024%2C817&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-2.png?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-2.png?resize=768%2C613&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-2.png?resize=790%2C630&amp;ssl=1 790w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twitter-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Again, this is a dramatic oversimplification, but the important takeaway is that the user-facing parts of Twitter are distinct from — and, frankly, not very pertinent to — the core Twitter service.</p>\n<h4>Twitter&#8217;s API Drama</h4>\n<p>The general idea behind a services architecture is that various functionalities are exposed via application programming interfaces, more commonly known as APIs; a &#8220;client&#8221; will leverage these APIs to build an end user experience. There is no requirement that these clients be owned or managed by the centralized service, and for the first several years of Twitter&#8217;s existence, that is exactly how the service operated: Twitter the company ran the service and the Twitter.com website, while third-parties built clients that let you access Twitter first on the desktop and then on smartphones.</p>\n<p>Mobile was an absolute boon for Twitter: the public messaging service, modeled on SMS, was a natural fit for a smartphone screen, and the immediacy of Twitter updates was perfectly suited to a device that was always connected to the Internet. The explosion in mobile usage, though, led to a situation where Twitter didn&#8217;t actually control the user experience for a huge portion of its users. This actually led to a ton of innovation: Twitterrific, for example, the earliest third party client, came up with the Twitter bird, the term &#8220;tweet&#8221; for a Twitter message, and early paradigms around replies and conversations. It also led to problems, the solutions to which fundamentally changed Twitter&#8217;s potential as a business.</p>\n<p>The first problem that came from Twitter the service relying on third party clients is that the company, which descended into politics and backstabbing from the board level on down almost immediately, was drifting along without a business model; the obvious candidate was advertising, but the easiest way to implement advertising was to control the user interface (and thus insert ads — ads, including promoted tweets, are another distinct service from Twitter itself). Thus Twitter bought Tweetie, widely regarded as the best Twitter mobile client (I was a user), in April 2010, and rebranded and relaunched it as the official Twitter for iPhone app a month later.</p>\n<p>The second problem is that starting in 2010, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Bill Gross (who invented search advertising) started trying to build his own Twitter monetization product called TweetUp; when Twitter acquired Tweetie and made clear they were going to monetize it via advertising, Gross started buying up multiple other third party Twitter clients with the idea of creating a competing network of clients that would monetize independently. Twitter responded in the short term by kicking several of Gross&#8217;s clients off of the platform for dubious terms-of-service violations, and in the long term by killing the 3rd party API for everyone. Clients could keep the users they had but could only add 100,000 more users — ever.</p>\n<p>The net result of these two decisions was that Twitter, its architecture notwithstanding, would be a unified entity where Twitter the company controlled every aspect of the experience, and that that experience would be monetized via advertising.</p>\n<h4>Twitter&#8217;s Reality</h4>\n<p>Twitter has, over 19 different funding rounds (including pre-IPO, IPO, and post-IPO), raised $4.4 billion in funding; meanwhile the company has lost a cumulative $861 million in its lifetime as a public company (i.e. excluding pre-IPO losses). During that time the company has held 33 earnings calls; the company reported a profit in only 14 of them.</p>\n<p>Given this financial performance it is kind of amazing that the company was valued at $30 billion the day before Musk&#8217;s investment was revealed; such is the value of Twitter&#8217;s social graph and its cultural impact: despite there being no evidence that Twitter can even be sustainably profitable, much less return billions of dollars to shareholders, hope springs eternal that the company is on the verge of unlocking its potential. At the same time, these three factors — Twitter&#8217;s financials, its social graph, and its cultural impact — get at why Musk&#8217;s offer to take Twitter private is so intriguing.</p>\n<p>Start with the financials: Twitter&#8217;s business stinks. Yes, you can make an argument that this is due to mismanagement and poor execution — who enjoys seeing a stale promoted tweet about something that happened weeks ago?<sup id=\"rf1-8837\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/back-to-the-future-of-twitter/#fn1-8837\" title=\"A friend sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1507369880995221507?s=20&#038;t=zgb8z5yVvmOQh03qrqwNAg&quot;&gt;this promoted tweet&lt;/a&gt; on April 15, almost a full month since Kentucky had been eliminated from March Madness, and well over a week after the entire tournament had ended\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> — but <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/twitter-has-a-new-ceo-what-about-a-new-business-model/\">I have also made the argument</a> that Twitter just isn&#8217;t well suited to direct response advertising in particular:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Think about the contrast between Twitter and Instagram; both are unique amongst social networks in that they follow a broadcast model: tweets on Twitter and photos on Instagram are public by default, and anyone can follow anyone. The default medium, though, is fundamentally different: Twitter has photos and videos, but the heart of the service is text (and links). Instagram, on the other hand, is nothing but photos and video (and link in bio).</p>\n<p>  The implications of this are vast. Sure, you may follow your friends on both, but on Twitter you will also follow news breakers, analysts, insightful anons, joke tellers, and shit posters. The goal is to mainline information, and Twitter’s speed and information density are unparalleled by anything in the world. On Instagram, though, you might follow brands and influencers, and your chief interaction with your friends is stories about their Turkey Day exploits. It’s about aspiration, not information, and the former makes a lot more sense for effective advertising.</p>\n<p>  It’s more than just the medium though; it’s about the user’s mental state as well. Instagram is leisurely and an escape, something you do when you’re procrastinating; Twitter is intense and combative, and far more likely to be tied to something happening in the physical world, whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/twitter-has-a-new-ceo-what-about-a-new-business-model/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=640%2C373&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Instagram is a lean-back experience; on Twitter you lean forward\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8120\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?w=857&amp;ssl=1 857w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-1.png?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  This matters for advertising, particularly advertising that depends on a direct response: when you are leaning back and relaxed why not click through to that Shopify site to buy that knick-knack you didn’t even know you needed, or try out that mobile game? When you are leaning forward, though, you don’t have either the time or the inclination.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article made the argument for Twitter to move towards more of a subscription offering; that may be the wrong idea, but the bigger takeaway is that what Twitter has been trying to build for years just isn&#8217;t working, and the challenges aren&#8217;t just bad management. To put it another way, when it comes to Twitter&#8217;s business, there really isn&#8217;t much to lose, but Twitter could only risk losing what there is if it were a private company, free from the glare of public markets who, for very justifiable reasons, give Twitter&#8217;s management a very short leash.</p>\n<p>What is valuable is that social graph: while Facebook understands who you know, Twitter, more than any other company, understands what its users are interested in. That is, in theory, much more valuable; said value is diminished by the fact that Twitter just doesn&#8217;t have that many users, relatively speaking; the users it has, though, are extremely influential, particularly given the important of Twitter in media, tech, and finance. For this group Twitter is completely irreplaceable: there is no other medium with a similar density of information or interest-driven network effects.</p>\n<p>This, by extension, drives Twitter&#8217;s cultural impact: no, most people don&#8217;t get their news off of Twitter; the places they get their news, though, are driven by Twitter. Moreover, Twitter not only sets the agenda for media organizations, it also harmonizes coverage, thanks to a dynamic where writers, unmoored from geographic constraints or underlying business realities of their publications, end up writing for other writers on Twitter, oftentimes radicalizing each other in plain sight of their readership. Twitter itself is part of this harmonization, going so far as to censor politically impactful stories in the weeks before an election; it&#8217;s no surprise that when Musk says he wants to impose a stronger free speech ethos that the reaction is fierce and littered with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy\">motte-and-baileys</a> (&#8220;actually we just care about limiting abuse and spam!&#8221;).</p>\n<h4>Back to the Future</h4>\n<p>This is all build-up to my proposal for what Musk — or any other bidder for Twitter, for that matter — ought to do with a newly private Twitter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, Twitter&#8217;s current fully integrated model is a financial failure.</li>\n<li>Second, Twitter&#8217;s social graph is extremely valuable.</li>\n<li>Third, Twitter&#8217;s cultural impact is very large, and very controversial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given this, Musk (who I will use as a stand-in for any future CEO of Twitter) should start by splitting Twitter into two companies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One company would be the core Twitter service, including the social graph.</li>\n<li>The other company would be all of the Twitter apps and the advertising business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TwitterAppCo would contract with TwitterServiceCo to continue to receive access to the Twitter service and social graph; currently Twitter earns around $13/user/year in advertising, so you could imagine a price of say $7.50/user/year, or perhaps $0.75/user/month. TwitterAppCo would be free to pursue the same business model and moderation policies that Twitter is pursuing today (I can imagine Musk sticking with TwitterServiceCo, and the employees upset about said control being a part of TwitterAppCo).</p>\n<p>However, that relationship would not be exclusive: TwitterServiceCo would open up its API to any other company that might be interested in building their own client experience; each company would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay for the right to get access to the Twitter service and social graph.</li>\n<li>Monetize in whatever way they see fit (i.e. they could pursue a subscription model).</li>\n<li>Implement their own moderation policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This last point would cut a whole host of Gordian Knots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market competition would settle the question about whether or not stringent moderation is an important factor in success; some client experiences would be heavily moderated, and some wouldn&#8217;t be moderated at all.</li>\n<li>The fact that everyone gets access to the same Twitter service and social graph solves the cold start problem for alternative networks; the reason why Twitter alternatives always fail is because Twitter&#8217;s network effect is so important.</li>\n<li>TwitterServiceCo could wash its hands of difficult moderation decisions or tricky cultural issues; the U.S. might have a whole host of Twitter client options, while Europe might be more stringent, and India more stringent still. Heck, this model could even accommodate a highly-censored China client (although this is highly unlikely).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I strongly suspect that a dramatic increase in competition amongst Twitter client services would benefit TwitterServiceCo, growing its market in a way that hasn&#8217;t happened in years. What is most exciting, though, is the potential development of new kinds of services that don&#8217;t look like Twitter at all.</p>\n<p>Step back a moment and think about the fundamental infrastructure of the Internet: we have a media protocol in HTTP/web, and a communications protocol in SMTP/email; what is missing is a notifications protocol. And yet, at the same time, if there is one lesson from mobile, it is just how important notifications are; a secondary consideration is how important identity is. If you can know how to reach someone, and have the means to do so, you are set, whether you be a critical service, an advertiser, or anything in-between. Twitter has the potential to fill that role: the ability to route short messages to a knowable endpoint accessible via a centralized directory has far more utility than political signaling and infighting. And yet, thanks to Twitter&#8217;s early decisions and lack of leadership, the latter is all the service is good for; no wonder user growth and financial results have stagnated!</p>\n<p>A truly open TwitterServiceCo has the potential to be a new protocol for the Internet — the notifications and identity protocol; unlike every other protocol, though, this one would be owned by a private company. That would be insanely valuable, but it is a value that will never be realized as long as Twitter is a public company led by <a href=\"https://om.co/2022/04/15/musk-or-not-twitter-ceo-needs-to-go/\">a weak CEO and ineffective board</a> driving an integrated business predicated on a business model that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<h4>Twitter&#8217;s Reluctance</h4>\n<p>The surest evidence of the Twitter board&#8217;s lack of imagination and ineffectiveness is that their response to Musk&#8217;s proposal is to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/twitter-elon-musk-poison-pill-7a62f6d6-b77a-4481-a2e3-5a7081557a84.html\">further dilute existing shareholders as a means of denying Musk control</a>. This is, in my estimation, clearly against the interest of Twitter shareholders (which, for what it&#8217;s worth, don&#8217;t in any meaningful way <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1515377028295389186\">include Twitter&#8217;s board members</a>); given Twitter&#8217;s performance over the last decade, though, this isn&#8217;t really a surprise.</p>\n<p>Indeed, when you consider the fact that Twitter&#8217;s board members not only don&#8217;t own much of Twitter, but famously, barely use Twitter at all, it is easy to wonder if the actual goal is not financial results but rather harnessing that immense cultural impact. This suspicion only intensifies when you consider that the bidder in this case is one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time: if there was one person in the world who could realize Twitter&#8217;s latent value, wouldn&#8217;t Musk be at the top of the list? And yet he is anathema, not for his business acumen, but despite it.</p>\n<p>This, more than anything, makes me even more sure that my proposal for competition amongst Twitter client companies is essential: not only do I think that more competition would lead to dramatically more innovation, but it would also solve the problem of who decides what we see by undoing the centralization of that power and subjecting decisions to market forces. That this is unacceptable to some says more about their ultimate motivations than anything else.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/what-about-bluesky-moderation-and-control-whats-next-for-twitter/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-8837\"><p >A friend sent me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1507369880995221507?s=20&#038;t=zgb8z5yVvmOQh03qrqwNAg\">this promoted tweet</a> on April 15, almost a full month since Kentucky had been eliminated from March Madness, and well over a week after the entire tournament had ended&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/back-to-the-future-of-twitter/#rf1-8837\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content</title>\n\t\t<link>https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 14:46:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stratechery.com/?p=8799</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Machine-learning generated content has major implications on the Metaverse, because it brings the marginal cost of production to zero.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23012123/openai-clip-dalle-2-ai-text-to-image-generator-testing\">OpenAI released DALL-E 2</a>, which produces (or edits) images based on textual prompts;

some excerpts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Dall-E 2 is a new AI system from OpenAI that can take simple text descriptions like &#8220;A koala dunking a basketball&#8221; and turn them into photorealistic images that have never existed before. DALL-E 2 can also realistically edit and re-touch photos…</p>\n<p>  DALL-E was created by training a neural network on images and their text descriptions. Through deep learning it not only understands individual objects like koala bears and motorcycles, but learns from relationships between objects, and when you ask DALL-E for an image of a &#8220;koala bear riding a motorcycle&#8221;, it knows how to create that or anything else with a relationship to another object or action.</p>\n<p>  The DALL-E research has three main outcomes: first, it can help people express themselves visually in ways they may not have been able to before. Second, an AI-generated image can tell us a lot about whether the system understands us, or is just repeating what it&#8217;s been taught. Third, DALL-E helps humans understand how AI systems see and understand our world. This is a critical part of developing AI that&#8217;s useful and safe…</p>\n<p>  What&#8217;s exciting about the approach used to train DALL-E is that it can take what it learned from a variety of other labeled images and then apply it to a new image. Given a picture of a monkey, DALL-E can infer what it would look like doing something it has never done before, like paying its taxes while wearing a funny hat. DALL-E is an example of how imaginative humans and clever systems can work together to make new things, amplifying our creative potential.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That last line may raise some eyebrows: at first glance DALL-E looks poised to compete with artists and illustrators; there is another point of view, though, where DALL-E points towards a major missing piece in a metaverse future.</p>\n<h4>Games and Medium Evolution</h4>\n<p>Games have long been on the forefront of technological development, and that is certainly the case in terms of medium. The first computer games were little more than text:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot from Oregon Trail\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8804\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-5.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Images followed, usually of the bitmap variety; I remember playing a lot of &#8220;Where in the world is Carmen San Diego&#8221; at the library:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-1.png?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot from &quot;Where in the world is Carmen San Diego&quot;\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8805\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-1.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dall-e-1.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Soon games included motion as you navigated a sprite through a 2D world; 3D followed, and most of the last 25 years has been about making 3D games ever more realistic. Nearly all of those games, though, are 3D images on 2D screens; virtual reality offers the illusion of being inside the game itself.</p>\n<p>Still, this evolution has had challenges: creating ever more realistic 3D games means creating ever more realistic image textures to decorate all of those polygons; this problem is only magnified in virtual reality. This is one of the reasons even open-world games are ultimately limited in scope, and gameplay is largely deterministic: it is through knowing where you are going, and all of your options to get there, that developers can create all of the assets necessary to deliver an immersive experience.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that games can&#8217;t have random elements, above and beyond <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike\">roguelike</a> games that are procedurally generated: the most obvious way to deliver an element of unpredictability is for humans to play each other, albeit in well-defined and controlled environments.</p>\n<h4>Social and User-Generated Content</h4>\n<p>Social networking has undergone a similar medium evolution as games, with a two-decade delay. The earliest forms of social networking on the web were text-based bulletin boards and USENET groups; then came widespread e-mail, AOL chatrooms, and forums. Facebook arrived on the scene in the mid-2000s; one of the things that helped it explode in popularity was the addition of images. Instagram was an image-only social network that soon added video, which is all that TikTok is. And, over the last couple of years in particular, video conferencing through apps like Zoom or Facetime have delivered 3D images on 2D screens.</p>\n<p>Still, medium has always mattered less for social networking, just because the social part of it was so inherently interesting. Humans like communicating with other humans, even if that requires dialing up a random BBS to download messages, composing a reply, and dialing back in to send it. Games may be mostly deterministic, but humans are full of surprises.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this means that social networking is much cheaper: instead of the platform having to generate all of the content, users generate all of the content themselves. This makes it harder to get a new platform off of the ground, because you need users to attract users, but it also makes said platform far stickier than any game (or, to put it another way, the stickiest games have a network effect of their own).</p>\n<h4>Feeds and Algorithms</h4>\n<p>The first iterations of social networking had no particular algorithmic component other than time: newer posts were at the top (or bottom). That changed with Facebook&#8217;s introduction of the News Feed in 2006. Now instead of visiting all of your friends&#8217; pages you could simply browse the feed, which from the very beginning made decisions about what content to include, and in what order.</p>\n<p>Over time the News Feed evolved from a relatively straightforward algorithm to one driven by machine learning, with results so inscrutable that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23004326/facebook-news-feed-downranking-integrity-bug\">it took Facebook six months to fix a recent rankings bug</a>. The impact has been massive: not just Facebook but also Instagram saw huge increases in engagement and increased growth the better their algorithmically-driven feeds became; it was also great for monetization, as the same sort of signals that decided what content you saw also influenced what ads you were presented.</p>\n<p>However, the reason why this discussion of algorithmically-driven feeds is in a different section than social networking is because the ultimate example of their power isn&#8217;t a social network at all: it&#8217;s TikTok. TikTok, of course, is all user-generated content, but the crucial distinction from Facebook is that you aren&#8217;t limited to content from your network: TikTok pulls in the videos it thinks you specifically are most interested in from across its entire network. I explained why this was a blindspot for Facebook <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/\">in 2020</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What is interesting to point out is why it was inevitable that Facebook missed this: first, Facebook views itself first-and-foremost as a social network, so it is disinclined to see that as a liability. Second, that view was reinforced by the way in which Facebook took on Snapchat. The point of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-audacity-of-copying-well/\">The Audacity of Copying Well</a> is that Facebook leveraged Instagram’s social network to halt Snapchat’s growth, which only reinforced that the network was Facebook’s greatest asset, making the TikTok blindspot even larger.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>TikTok combines the zero cost nature of user-generated content with a purely algorithmic feed that is divorced from your network; there is a network effect, in that TikTok needs lots of content to choose from, but it doesn&#8217;t need your specific network.</p>\n<h4>The Machine Learning Metaverse</h4>\n<p>I get that <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/metaverses/\">metaverses</a> were so 2021, but it strikes me that the examples from science fiction, including <em>Snow Crash</em> and <em>Ready Player One</em>, were very game-like in their implementation. Their virtual worlds were created by visionary corporations or, in the case of the latter, a visionary developer who also included a deterministic game for ultimate ownership of the virtual world. Yes, third parties could and did build experiences with strong social components, most famously Da5id&#8217;s Black Sun club in <em>Snow Crash</em>, but the core mechanic — and the core economics — were closer to a multi-player game than anything else.</p>\n<p>That, though, is exceptionally challenging in the real world: remember, creating games, particularly their art, is expensive, and the expense increases the more immersive the experience is. Social media, on the other hand, is cheap because it uses user-generated content, but that content is generally stuck on more basic mediums — text, pictures, and only recently video. Of course that content doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be limited to your network — an algorithm can deliver anything on the network to any user.</p>\n<p>What is fascinating about DALL-E is that it points to a future where these three trends can be combined. DALL-E, at the end of the day, is ultimately a product of human-generated content, just like its GPT-3 cousin. The latter, of course, is about text, while DALL-E is about images. Notice, though, that progression from text to images; it follows that machine learning-generated video is next. This will likely take several years, of course; video is a much more difficult problem, and responsive 3D environments more difficult yet, but this is a path the industry has trod before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game developers pushed the limits on text, then images, then video, then 3D</li>\n<li>Social media drives content creation costs to zero first on text, then images, then video</li>\n<li>Machine learning models can now create text and images for zero marginal cost</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs.</p>\n<h4>Zero Marginal Content</h4>\n<p>There is another way to think about DALL-E and GPT and similar machine learning models, and it goes back to my longstanding contention that the Internet is a transformational technology matched only by the printing press. What made the latter revolutionary was that it drastically reduced the marginal cost of consumption; from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/\">The Internet and the Third Estate</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Meanwhile, the economics of printing books was fundamentally different from the economics of copying by hand. The latter was purely an operational expense: output was strictly determined by the input of labor. The former, though, was mostly a capital expense: first, to construct the printing press, and second, to set the type for a book. The best way to pay for these significant up-front expenses was to produce as many copies of a particular book that could be sold.</p>\n<p>  How, then, to maximize the number of copies that could be sold? The answer was to print using the most widely used dialect of a particular language, which in turn incentivized people to adopt that dialect, standardizing languages across Europe. That, by extension, deepened the affinities between city-states with shared languages, particularly over decades as a shared culture developed around books and later newspapers. This consolidation occurred at varying rates — England and France several hundred years before Germany and Italy — but in nearly every case the First Estate became not the clergy of the Catholic Church but a national monarch, even as the monarch gave up power to a new kind of meritocratic nobility epitomized by Burke.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Internet has had two effects: the first is to bring the marginal cost of consumption down to zero. Even with the printing press you still needed to print a physical object and distribute it, and that costs money; meanwhile it costs effectively nothing to send this post to anyone in the world who is interested. This has completely upended the publishing industry and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/goodbye-gatekeepers/\">destroyed the power of gatekeepers</a>.</p>\n<p>The other impact, though, has been on the production side; I wrote about TikTok in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/mistakes-and-memes/\">Mistakes and Memes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  That phrase, “Facebook is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who surfaces it”, is oh-so-close to describing TikTok; the error is that the latter is compelling for the content it surfaces, regardless of who <em>creates</em> it…To put it another way, I was too focused on demand — the key to Aggregation Theory — and didn’t think deeply enough about the evolution of supply. User-generated content didn’t have to be simply pictures of pets and political rants from people in one’s network; it could be the foundation of a new kind of network, where the payoff from Metcalfe’s Law is not the number of connections available to any one node, but rather the number of inputs into a customized feed.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Machine learning generated content is just the next step beyond TikTok: instead of pulling content from anywhere on the network, GPT and DALL-E and other similar models generate new content from content, at zero marginal cost. This is how the economics of the metaverse will ultimately make sense: virtual worlds needs virtual content created at virtually zero cost, fully customizable to the individual.</p>\n<p>Of course there are many other issues raised by DALL-E, many of them philosophical in nature; there has already been a lot of discussion of that over the last week, and there should be a lot more. Still, the economic implications matter as well, and after last week&#8217;s announcement the future of the Internet is closer, and weirder, than ever.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why Netflix Should Sell Ads</title>\n\t\t<link>https://stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-sell-ads/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 14:26:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stratechery.com/?p=8757</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Netflix has been resolutely opposed to selling ads, prioritizing the user experience; however, the market conditions for streaming have changed, and so should Netflix]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-tells-employees-to-be-more-careful-about-spending-hiring?rc=gtxu6q\">reported over the weekend</a> that Netflix executives have told employees to keep an eye on the bottom line:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In two separate meetings over the past few weeks, Netflix executives cautioned employees to be more mindful about spending and hiring, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The comments, made at an employee town hall on Monday as well as during a management offsite held last month in Anaheim, Calif., come as the streaming giant grapples with sharply slowing subscriber growth…</p>\n<p>  Netflix has also been pondering steps that could help offset the revenue impact of the subscriber slowdown, including cracking down on people sharing the passwords to their accounts. While Netflix has long allowed such password sharing, it has become more common in the U.S. and other parts of the world than executives anticipated, the people said. This effort has been underway for about a year, however, well before the slowdown became apparent.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are presented as two different issues, but there is a connection between them: Netflix should be hiring more people — a lot of them — and those people should be building a product that increases subscriber numbers and revenue. That product is advertising.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Business Model: Subscriptions</h4>\n<p>Netflix is, incredibly enough, 24 years old, and a subscription model has served the company well. Not that Netflix had much choice when it started: the company briefly sold DVDs online, before focusing exclusively on renting them; neither approach offered much surface area for advertising, and besides, the subscription model was revolutionary in its own right.</p>\n<p>DVDs-by-mail was, from a certain perspective, inconvenient: you couldn&#8217;t simply drive to your local Blockbuster and peruse the selection; on the other hand, Netflix&#8217;s model gave you access to nearly every movie ever released, not just those in stock at your local store. The real innovation, though, was that business model: instead of paying to rent a DVD and being gouged with late fees, you could pay a set amount each month and keep the DVDs Netflix mailed to you as long as you wanted; send one back to get the next one in your queue.</p>\n<p>Consumers loved it, and Netflix has stuck with the model even as the shift to streaming flipped their value proposition on its head: streaming is even more convenient than hopping in your car, but only a subset of content (ever-expanding, to be sure) is on Netflix. That has been more than enough to fuel Netflix&#8217;s growth; the service had 222 million subscribers at the end of 2021.</p>\n<p>Still, as The Information noted, that number isn&#8217;t increasing as quickly as it used to. Netflix sported over 20% year-over-year subscriber growth for years (usually more than that), but hasn&#8217;t broken the 20% mark since Q4 2020; growth for the last three quarters was in the single digits. Some of that is likely due to growth that was pulled forward by the pandemic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=640%2C352&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Netflix subscriber additions by year\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8365\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=1024%2C563&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?resize=1145%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1145w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/netflix-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The bigger problem, though, is saturation: Netflix has 75 million subscribers in the US and Canada, where there are around 132 million households. That is nearly as many subscribers as linear TV (84 million), and once you consider shared passwords, penetration may be higher. Other markets like India have more room to grow, but much lower household incomes, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/netflix-movies-shows-struggle-to-attract-india-subscribers\">Netflix&#8217;s relatively high prices have been an obstacle</a>.</p>\n<p>Netflix has ways to grow other than subscribers, most obviously by raising prices. The company has done just that on a mostly annual basis for eight years: in the U.S. the price of a Standard subscription (HD, 2 screens) has increased from $7.99 to $15.49. Netflix executives argue that customers don&#8217;t mind because Netflix keeps increasing the amount of content they find compelling; it&#8217;s an argument that is easier to accept when subscriber growth is up-and-to-the-right. Now the task is to keep raising prices while ensuring subscriber numbers don&#8217;t start going in the opposite direction.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s New Initiative: Gaming</h4>\n<p>To accomplish this Netflix is not only continuing to invest in original programming, but also branching out into new kinds of content, including games. This may seem an odd idea at first: sure, Netflix is generating some new IP, but it would generally be much easier to license that IP than to become proficient at gaming. Netflix, though, believes it has a unique advantage when it comes to gaming: its business model. Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said in the company&#8217;s Q2 2021 <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Netflix,-Inc.,-Q2-2021-Pre-Recorded-Earnings-Call,-Jul-20,-2021.pdf\">earnings interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Our subscription model yields some opportunities to focus on a set of game experiences that are currently underserved by the sort of dominant monetization models and games. We don’t have to think about ads. We don’t have to think about in-game purchases or other monetization. We don’t have to think about per-title purchases. Really, we can do what we’ve been doing on the movie and series side, which is just hyper laser-focused on delivering the most entertaining game experiences that we can. So we’re finding that many game developers really like that concept and that focus and this idea of being able to put all of their creative energy into just great gameplay and not having to worry about those other considerations that they have typically had to trade off with just making compelling games.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Netflix&#8217;s gaming efforts to date have been fairly limited; the company <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile\">launched with five titles in November</a>, but the fact the company has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/netflix-game-studio.html\">bought three gaming studios</a> suggests a strong appetite for more — at least amongst Netflix executives.</p>\n<p>But what about consumers?</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Job: TV</h4>\n<p>Consumers don&#8217;t care so much about business models; they have jobs that they want to get done, and the traditional cable bundle used to do a whole bunch of jobs: information gathering, education, sports, story-telling, escapism, background noise, and more. As I noted in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/\">The Great Unbundling</a>, these jobs are increasingly done by completely different services: we get news on the Internet, education from YouTube, story-telling from streaming services, etc.</p>\n<p>Netflix is obviously one of those streaming services, but the company is also investing in movies (escapism), and is increasingly the default choice when it comes to the under-appreciated &#8220;background noise&#8221; category: the service has oceans of low-brow content ready to be streamed while you are barely paying attention. This is a big reason why for many people their choice of streaming services is a matter of which service do they subscribe to in addition to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Still, all of these jobs are about passively consuming content; from a consumer perspective gaming is something different, in that you are an active participant. To that end, it&#8217;s not clear to me why consumers would even think to consider Netflix when it comes to gaming: that&#8217;s not what the service&#8217;s job is, nor was it the job of the linear TV bundle that Netflix is helping replace.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Market: Attention</h4>\n<p>Then again, as founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings likes to say, Netflix&#8217;s competition is much broader than TV; Hastings wrote in the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://q4live.s22.clientfiles.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2018/q4/01/FINAL-Q4-18-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">Q4 letter to shareholders</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time and less than that of mobile screen time. In 2 other countries, we earn a lower percentage of screen time due to lower penetration of our service. We earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors. We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time. Hulu is small compared to YouTube for viewing time, and they are successful in the US, but non-existent in Canada, which creates a comparison point: our penetration in the two countries is pretty similar. There are thousands of competitors in this highly-fragmented market vying to entertain consumers and low barriers to entry for those with great experiences. Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose. Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hastings&#8217; point was that analysts should not be overly focused on the threat posed by other streaming services; Netflix has been fighting for attention for years. This is correct, by the way: thanks to the Internet everything from television to social networking to gaming can be delivered at zero marginal cost; the only scarce resource is time, which means attention is the only thing that needs to be competed for.</p>\n<p>Well, that and money: companies competing for customer money need a way to communicate to customers what they have to sell and why it is compelling; that means advertising, and advertising requires attention. It follows, then, that the most effective business model in the attention economy is advertising: if customers rely on Google or Facebook to navigate the abundance of content that is the result of zero marginal costs, then it is Google and Facebook that are the best-placed to sell effective ads.</p>\n<p>Notice, though, the trouble this Internet reality presents to Netflix: if content is abundant and attention is scarce, it&#8217;s easier to sell attention than content; Netflix&#8217;s business model, though, is the exact opposite.</p>\n<h4>Netflix&#8217;s Differentiation: Unique Content</h4>\n<p>Netflix, of course, sees this as a differentiator, and for a long time it was: linear TV had commercials, while Netflix had none. Linear TV made you wait for your favorite show, while Netflix gave you entire seasons at once. This was particularly compelling when Netflix had similar content to linear TV: why would you put up with commercials and TV schedules when you could just stream what you wanted to?</p>\n<p>However, as more and more content has moved away from TV and to competing streaming services, differentiation is no longer based on the user experience, but rather uniqueness; on-demand no-commercials is no longer unique, but <em>Stranger Things</em> can only be found on Netflix.</p>\n<p>Here Netflix&#8217;s biggest advantage is the sheer size of its subscriber base: Netflix can, on an absolute basis, pay more than its streaming competitors for the content it wants, even as its per-subscriber cost basis is lower. This advantage is only accentuated the larger Netflix&#8217;s subscriber base gets, and the more revenue it makes per subscriber; the user experience of getting to that unique content doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>All of these factors make a compelling case for Netflix to start building an advertising business.</p>\n<p>First, an advertising-supported or subsidized tier would expand Netflix&#8217;s subscriber base, which is not only good for the company&#8217;s long-term growth prospects, but also competitive position when it comes to acquiring content. This also applies to the company&#8217;s recent attempts to crack down on password sharing, and struggles in the developing world: an advertising-based tier is a much more accessible alternative.</p>\n<p>Second, advertising would make it easier for Netflix to continue to raise prices: on one hand, it would provide an alternative for marginal customers who might otherwise churn, and on the other hand, it would create a new benefit for those willing to pay (i.e. no advertising for the highest tiers).</p>\n<p>Third, advertising is a natural fit for the jobs Netflix does. Sure, customers enjoy watching shows without ads — and again, they can continue to pay for that — but filler TV, which Netflix also specializes in, is just as easily filled with ads.</p>\n<p>Above all, though, is the fact that advertising is a great opportunity that aligns with Netflix&#8217;s business: while the company once won with a differentiated user experience worth paying for, today Netflix demands scarce attention because of its investment in unique content. That attention can be sold, and should be, particularly as it increases Netflix&#8217;s ability to invest in more unique content, and/or charge higher prices to its user base.</p>\n<p>This, I will note, is an about face for me; I&#8217;ve long been skeptical that Netflix would ever sell advertising, or that they should. The former may still be warranted, particularly in light of Netflix&#8217;s gaming initiative. This feels like solipsism: Netflix&#8217;s executives think a lot about their business model, so they are looking for growth opportunities that seem to leverage said business model; I&#8217;m not convinced, though, that customers appreciate or care about the differentiation that Netflix claims to be leveraging in gaming, whereas they would appreciate lower prices for streaming, and already have the expectation for ads on TV.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, subscriber growth has stalled, even as the advertising market has proven to be much larger than even Google or Facebook can cover. Moreover, the post-ATT world is freeing up more money for the sort of top-of-funnel advertising that would probably be the norm on a Netflix advertising service. In short, the opportunity is there, the product is right, and the business need is pressing in a way it wasn&#8217;t previously.</p>\n<p>Of course this would be a lot of work, and a big shift in Netflix&#8217;s well-defined value proposition; Netflix, though, has made big shifts before: the entire reason why advertising is a possibility is because Netflix is a streamer, not a DVD mailer.

On the one hand, the theme of Huang&#8217;s keynote was the idea of AI creating AI via machine learning; he called the idea &#8220;intelligence manufacting&#8221;:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><div id=\"v-KxAM0mD4-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-KxAM0mD4-1-video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\"><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></div></video></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>\n  None of these capabilities were remotely possible a decade ago. Accelerated computing, at data center scale, and combined with machine learning, has sped up computing by a million-x. Accelerated computing has enabled revolutionary AI models like the transformer, and made self-supervised learning possible. AI has fundamentally changed what software can make, and how you make software. Companies are processing and refining their data, making AI software, becoming intelligence manufacturers. Their data centers are becoming AI factories. The first wave of AI learned perception and inference, like recognizing images, understanding speech, recommending a video, or an item to buy. The next wave of AI is robotics: AI planning actions. Digital robots, avatars, and physical robots will perceive, plan, and act, and just as AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have become integral to AI software, Omniverse will be essential to making robotics software. Omniverse will enable the next wave of AI.</p>\n<p>  We will talk about the next million-x, and other dynamics shaping our industry, this GTC. Over the past decade, Nvidia-accelerated computing delivered a million-x speed-up in AI, and started the modern AI revolution. Now AI will revolutionize all industries. The CUDA libraries, the Nvidia SDKs, are at the heart of accelerated computing. With each new SDK, new science, new applications, and new industries can tap into the power of Nvidia computing. These SDKs tackle the immense complexity at the intersection of computing, algorithms, and science. The compound effect of Nvidia&#8217;s full-stack approach resulted in a million-x speed-up. Today, Nvidia accelerates millions of developers, and tens of thousands of companies and startups. GTC is for all of you.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The core idea behind machine learning is that computers, presented with massive amounts of data, can extract insights and ideas from that data that no human ever could; to put it another way, the development of not just insights but, going forward, software itself, is an emergent process. Nvidia&#8217;s role is making massively parallel computing platforms that do the calculations necessary for this emergent process far more quickly than was ever possible with general purpose computing platforms like those undergirding the PC or smartphone.</p>\n<p>What is so striking about Nvidia generally and Huang in particular, though, is the extent to which this capability is the result of the precise opposite of an emergent process: Nvidia the company feels like a deliberate design, nearly 29 years in the making. The company started accelerating defined graphical functions, then invented the shader, which made it possible to program the hardware doing that acceleration. This new approach to processing, though, required new tools, so Nvidia invented them, and has <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/nvidias-gtc-keynote-the-nvidia-stack-the-omniverse/\">been building on their fully integrated stack ever since</a>.</p>\n<p>The deliberateness of Nvidia&#8217;s vision is one of the core themes I explored in this interview with Huang recorded shortly after his GTC keynote. We also touch on Huang&#8217;s background, including immigrating to the United States as a child, Nvidia&#8217;s failed ARM acquisition, and more. One particularly striking takeaway for me came at the end of the interview, where Huang said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Intelligence is the ability to recognize patterns, recognize relationships, reason about it and make a prediction or plan an action. That&#8217;s what intelligence is. It has nothing to do with general intelligence, intelligence is just solving problems. We now have the ability to write software, we now have the ability to partner with computers to write software, that can solve many types of intelligence, make many types of predictions at scales and at levels that no humans can.</p>\n<p>  For example, we know that there are a trillion things on the Internet and the number things on the Internet is large and expanding incredibly fast, and yet we have this little tiny personal computer called a phone, how do we possibly figure out of the trillion things in the internet what we want to see on our little tiny phone? Well, there needs to be a filter in between, what people call the personalized internet, but basically an AI, a recommender system. A recommender that figures out based on the nature of the content, the characteristics of the content, the features of the content, based on your implicit and your explicit and implicit preferences, find a way through all of that to predict what you would like to see. I mean, that&#8217;s a miracle! That&#8217;s really quite a miracle to be able to do that at scale for everything from movies and books and music and news and videos and you name it, products and things like that. To be able to predict what Ben would want to see, predict what you would want to click on, predict what is useful to you. I&#8217;m talking about things that are consumer oriented stuff, but in the future it&#8217;ll be predict what is the best financial strategy for you, predict what is the best medical therapy for you, predict what is the best health regimen for you, what&#8217;s the best vacation plan for you. All of these things are going to be possible with AI.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I note in the interview, this should ring a bell for Stratechery readers: what Huang is describing is the computing functionality that undergirds <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>, wherein value in a world of abundance accrues to those entities geared towards discovery and providing means of navigating this world that is fundamentally disconnected from the constraints of physical goods and geography. Nvidia&#8217;s role in this world is to provide the hardware capability for Aggregation, to be the Intel to Aggregators&#8217; Windows. That, needless to say, is an attractive position to be; like many such attractive positions, it is one that was built not in months or years, but decades.</p>\n<p>Read the full interview with Huang <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-about-manufacturing-intelligence/#interview\">here</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Current Thing</title>\n\t\t<link>https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 12:40:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stratechery.com/?p=8688</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[If businesses are subject to Aggregation Theory, then so are ideas: this is the root of the \"The Current Thing\" meme, and it should drive a re-evaluation of how we think about moderating content on the Internet.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most amazing things about the Internet is how it provides a level playing field for everyone: this post that you are reading was written by a single person, and it is just as accessible as an article written by the New York Times, or a proclamation issued by the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>It used to be that media organizations had a big advantage by virtue of owning printing presses and delivery trucks, or broadcast licenses; celebrities and politicians would have their proclamations carried across those same mediums by virtue of their popularity or power. The same advantages applied to other areas of the economy like retail and consumer packaged goods: building physical stores is a big barrier of entry if you want to be the former, and having a large and popular set of products gave big companies access to those retail channels.</p>\n<p>What is common to both examples was the importance of controlling physical space, but that control came with inherent limitations: a paper newspaper could not be delivered everywhere, and TV broadcasts were limited by the signal strength of broadcast towers. Stores had to be built, and packaged goods had to be stocked on shelves.</p>\n<p>The Internet changes all of that: now articles and videos are simply digital bits, easily created and easily transmitted anywhere on the globe, effectively for free. Physical goods still need to be made, but they can be sold to anyone by anyone, and shelf space has been replaced by the commoditized cardboard box.</p>\n<p>This first order reality, though, has had a multitude of second order effects. Newspapers, for example, were amongst the first online sites, and it seemed like a massive boon: now an article that was only accessible by those within a limited geographic area delineated by the reach of delivery trucks could be read by anyone in the world. The problem is that that same reach was available to everyone; back in 2014 I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/economic-power-age-abundance/\">Economic Power in the Age of Abundance</a>:<sup id=\"rf1-8688\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/#fn1-8688\" title=\"The image in the excerpt is from 2014; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CleanShot-2022-03-17-at-03.10.26@2x.png&quot;&gt;the updated view of the last thirty days&lt;/a&gt; is broadly similar, but there has been a big relative increase in Washington DC, Los Angeles, India, and Singapore.\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  One of the great paradoxes for newspapers today is that their financial prospects are inversely correlated to their addressable market.

For your typical newspaper, though, the competitive environment is diametrically opposed to what they are used to: instead of there being a scarce amount of published material, there is an overwhelming abundance. More importantly, this shift in the competitive environment has fundamentally changed just who has economic power.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article was one of the first articulations of the concepts undergirding <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>, which is downstream from the shift from geographic-driven scarcity to Internet-driven abundance: now the most valuable companies in the world were those that helped users navigate abundance, whether that be via search (Google), contacts (Facebook), or retail (Amazon).</p>\n<h4>The Current Thing Meme</h4>\n<p>Most of my discussion of Aggregation Theory has been about economics and concepts like zero marginal costs; just as it doesn&#8217;t cost anything to publish, it doesn&#8217;t cost Google anything (on a marginal basis) to help every person in the world find the specific piece of content they are looking for. This, by extension, motivates publishers to work well with Google, motivates users to use Google more, and gives Google the best possible opportunity to show ads, attracting more and more advertising.</p>\n<p>In other words, centralization is a second order effect of decentralization: when all constraints on content are removed, more power than ever accrues to the entity that is the preferred choice for navigating that content; moreover, that power compounds on itself in a virtuous feedback loop.</p>\n<p>This dynamic, though, goes beyond economics; consider the meme that inspired the title of this Article:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/CfoJ3qdCRJ\">pic.twitter.com/CfoJ3qdCRJ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503276966874595330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>This meme has, for rather obvious reasons, made a fair number of people upset, particularly to the extent it suggests that support for a country fighting for its existence in the face of a brutal invasion is somehow inauthentic. I think, though, that interpretation is too literal; after all, the meme can be extended in lots of different ways:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I support the current thing. <a href=\"https://t.co/e3WIeV6FHp\">pic.twitter.com/e3WIeV6FHp</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1504238641475821570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>What I think is captured here is orthogonal to the actual issue at hand (in the case of Musk&#8217;s version, Ukraine); the entire point of the generic labeling (&#8220;The Current Thing&#8221;) is that there is a dynamic that exists independent of the issue being critiqued, and my contention in this Article is that said dynamic is Aggregation Theory for ideas.</p>\n<h4>Aggregating Ideas</h4>\n<p>Go back to the point about the explosion of content on the Internet: the first order implication is that there is an explosion of ideas; after all, anyone can publish anything. Presumably this means that there are far more categories of thought than ever before! And, if you dig deep enough into the Internet, this is true.</p>\n<p>Most people, though, don&#8217;t dig that deep, just as they don&#8217;t dig that deep for content or contacts or commerce: it&#8217;s just far easier and more convenient to rely on Google or Facebook or Amazon. Why wouldn&#8217;t this same dynamic apply to ideas? Being informed about everything happening in the world is hard if not impossible: humans evolved to care intensely about what happened in their local environment; however, first mass media, and then the Internet, brought news from everywhere to our immediate attention.</p>\n<p>Given that, it seems entirely reasonable — expected even — that we all outsource our intuition for what events matter, and what our position on those events should be, to the most convenient option, especially if that option has obvious moral valence. Police brutality against people of color is obviously bad; people dying from COVID is obviously bad; Russia invading Ukraine is obviously bad; why wouldn&#8217;t each of us snap into opposition to obviously bad things?</p>\n<p>This dynamic is exactly what the meme highlights: sure, the Internet makes possible a wide range of viewpoints — you can absolutely find critics of Black Lives Matter, COVID policies, or pro-Ukraine policies — but the Internet, thanks to its lack of friction and instant feedback loops, also makes nearly every position but the dominant one untenable. If everyone believes one thing, the costs of believing something else increase dramatically, making the consensus opinion the only viable option; this is the same dynamic in which publishers become dependent on Google or Facebook, or retailers on Amazon, just because that is where money can be made.</p>\n<p>Again, to be very clear, that does not mean the opinion is wrong; as I noted, I think the resonance of this meme is orthogonal to the rightness of the position it is critiquing, and is instead concerned with the sense that there is something unique about the depth of sentiment surrounding issues that don&#8217;t necessarily apply in any real-life way to the people feeling said sentiment.</p>\n<h4>Righteousness and Dissent</h4>\n<p>Here I think it is useful to go back to economics. The more that an entity becomes dependent on an Aggregator, the more perilous the economic outlook for said entity. If you depend on Google or Facebook for traffic, or Amazon for sales, the more liable you are to <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/\">have your margin consumed by said entities</a>. A truly sustainable business model depends on being able to connect to your customers on your own terms, not an Aggregator’s.</p>\n<p>A similar critique can be made of ideas; I thought this tweet was very well-stated:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Putin&#39;s array of yes men convincing him his military was far more capable than it actually was and Xi&#39;s propaganda campaign against Western mRNA vaccines forcing him to rely on COVID Zero are powerful reminders that, as messy as it can be, an open democratic discourse is superior</p>\n<p>&mdash; Armand Domalewski (@ArmandDoma) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArmandDoma/status/1504220528265027592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>It is very counter-intuitive to see how &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas are in fact extremely valuable: not only do they highlight why the good ideas are better, but they also sometimes show that the &#8220;good&#8221; ideas are in fact wrong. Arguing that the earth was not the center of the universe was once a &#8220;bad&#8221; idea; it was also correct. At the same time, to think that the Catholic church of 500 years ago was the only time where the dominant mode of thinking clearly missed the mark seems exceptionally arrogant; we rightly believe that allowing room for dissidents was, in the past, a good thing. It seems clear to me that doing the same today is likely to prove more valuable than not.</p>\n<p>Here is the problem: it turns out it was much easier to believe in the value of dissidents in a world of meaningful marginal costs for the propagation of ideas. Most people never encountered contrary opinions when spreading said opinions entailed publishing them on paper and spreading them in the physical world; on the Internet, on the other hand, bad ideas are <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/zero-trust-information/\">only a search away</a>. Moreover, the means by which to suppress those opinions are far more obvious: instead of having to shut down a printing press, one only needs to pressure those same centralized Aggregators that arose for economic reasons to suppress &#8220;wrong&#8221; speech.</p>\n<p>The end result is a world where the ability for anyone to post any idea has, paradoxically, meant far greater mass adoption of popular ideas and far more effective suppression of &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas. That is invigorating when one feels the dominant idea is righteous; it seems reasonable to worry about the potential of said sense of righteousness overwhelming the consideration of whether particular courses of action are actually good or bad.</p>\n<h4>Moderation Frameworks</h4>\n<p>In 2019 I wrote an Article entitled <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-moderation/\">A Framework for Moderation</a>, which argued for a finely-tuned examination of the Internet stack as a driver of moderation decisions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It makes sense to think about these positions of the stack very differently: the top of the stack is about broadcasting — reaching as many people as possible — and while you may have the right to say anything you want, there is no right to be heard.

Both companies are the very definition of infrastructure, with no user-facing presence; it follows that they should not be making any decisions based on political considerations (with Carl von Clausewitz&#8217;s observation that &#8220;war is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means&#8221; in mind).</p>\n<p>And yet they have cut off Russia all the same, along with a whole host of Western companies.

The goal of this Article is to explore what those implications might be.</p>\n<p>Let me start with some caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, while I presume it goes without saying, I condemn Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.</li>\n<li>Second, the situation is obviously extremely fluid. My goal is to write about impacts that seem likely to endure, but some issues, particularly those involving China, could shift considerably.</li>\n<li>Third, the long-term is inherently difficult to predict. Nearly every major event that has has happened over the last several years, from Donald Trump&#8217;s election, to COVID, to this invasion, was not only not anticipated by most people, but was in fact dismissed even after there were signs in place that they might occur. So take all of this with the appropriate grain of salt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important thing to make clear about this Article, though, is that much of it is focused on <em>capabilities</em>, not <em>intentions.</em> In much of our daily life we rely on the good intentions of others, even if they have dangerous capabilities. One mundane example is traffic on a two-way street: oncoming cars have the capability of swerving into my lane and hitting me head-on; I trust that they do not intend to do so. There are a whole host of similar examples, for good reason: societies that trust each other&#8217;s intentions function much more smoothly and efficiently; no one wants every single street to be built with concrete dividers between traffic.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world international relations would work the same way, and there is an argument that much of the prosperity of the last few decades has been driven by the sort of increased trust and interconnectedness that comes from assuming the good intentions of other countries — or at a minimum enlightened self-interest — leading to increased economic efficiency for everyone engaged in global trade. In this arena, though, the question of capabilities is never far from the surface: what can one country do to another, should the intentions of the first country change, and what must the second country do to ameliorate that risk? And here there is very much a tech angle.</p>\n<h4>Public Versus Private Sanctions</h4>\n<p>In response to the invasion Western governments unleashed an unprecedented set of sanctions on Russia; these sanctions were primarily financial in nature, and included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disconnecting sanctioned Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system</li>\n<li>Cutting off the Russian Central Bank from foreign currency reserves held in the West</li>\n<li>Identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned Russian individuals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sanctions, which were announced last weekend, led to the crashing of the ruble and the ongoing closure of the Russian stock market, and are expected to wreak havoc on the Russian economy; now the U.S. and E.U. are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-europeans-discussing-banning-russian-oil-imports-blinken-says-2022-03-06/\">discussing banning imports of Russian oil</a>.</p>\n<p>This Article is not about those public sanctions, by which I mean sanctions coming from governments (Noah Smith has a useful overview of their impact <a href=\"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/how-are-the-big-sanctions-hurting\">here</a>); what is interesting to me is the extent to which these public sanctions have been accompanied by <em>private</em> sanctions by companies, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-says-it-has-stopped-all-product-sales-in-russia-11646169327\">stopped selling its products</a> in Russia (although still operates the App Store).</li>\n<li>Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/03/04/microsoft-suspends-russia-sales-ukraine-conflict/\">has suspended</a> all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia, and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/02/oracle_and_sap_suspend_business/\">SAP and Oracle</a> have suspended operations.</li>\n<li>Google and Facebook <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/google-suspends-all-advertising-in-russia-.html\">suspended all advertising</a> in Russia.</li>\n<li>Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, EA, and CD Projekt <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-epic-games-pause-game-sales-russia-201856440.html\">suspended game sales</a> in Russia.</li>\n<li>Disney, Sony, and Warner Bros. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/disney-pausing-film-releases-russia-over-ukraine-invasion-2022-03-01/\">paused film releases</a> in Russia, and Netflix <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/netflix-suspends-service-russia-ukraine-invasion-1235197390/\">suspended its service</a>.</li>\n<li>Visa and Mastercard <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-05/visa-suspends-all-russia-operations-l0eegccn\">cut off Russia</a> from their respective international payment networks, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/paypal-shuts-down-its-services-russia-citing-ukraine-aggression-2022-03-05/\">PayPal suspended service</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-04/samsung-suspends-shipments-of-phones-chips-to-russia\">Samsung</a> stopped selling phones and chips, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/619357/amd-officially-halts-chip-sales-to-russia.html\">Nvidia, Intel, and AMD</a> also stopped selling chips to Russia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an incomplete list! The key thing to note, though, is few if any of these actions were required by law; they were decisions made by individual companies.</p>\n<p>This, though, is where the <em>intentions</em> versus <em>capabilities</em> distinction arises, in two different respects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the public/private distinction that I just noted may not be so apparent to people outside of the U.S. or the West generally; one could certainly understand how other countries might interpret this collection of public and private sanctions as being different parts of a single whole. To that end, this collection of actions demonstrates the capability of effectively wiping an economy off of the map.</li>\n<li>Second, to the extent that the public/private distinction is understood, it highlights the capability of private companies to impose sanctions, and their willingness to do so in pursuit of political goals — even if those political goals are to stop an unjust invasion and save lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I suspect that both of these interpretations matter and will have long-reaching effects, in part because they are not a new trend, but a continuation of an ongoing one.</p>\n<h4>Internet 3.0 and the Rise of Politics</h4>\n<p>Last January I wrote an article entitled <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/\">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History</a> that argued that technology broadly has passed through two eras: 1.0 was the technological era, and 2.0 was the economic era.</p>\n<p>The technological era was defined by the creation of the technical building blocks and protocols that undergird the Internet; there were few economic incentives beyond building products that people might want to buy, in part because few thought there was any money to be made on the Internet. That changed during the 2000s, as it became increasingly clear that the Internet provided massive returns to scale in a way that benefited both Aggregators and their customers. I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Google was founded in 1998, in the middle of the dot-com bubble, but it was the company’s IPO in 2004 that, to my mind, marked the beginning of Internet 2.0. This period of the Internet was about the economics of zero friction; specifically, unlike the assumptions that undergird Internet 1.0, it turned out that the Internet does not disperse economic power but in fact centralizes it. This is what undergirds <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>: when services compete without the constraints of geography or marginal costs, dominance is achieved by controlling demand, not supply, and winners take most.</p>\n<p>  Aggregators like Google and Facebook weren’t the only winners though; the smartphone market was so large that it could sustain a duopoly of two platforms with multi-sided networks of developers, users, and OEMs (in the case of Android; Apple was both OEM and platform provider for iOS). Meanwhile, public cloud providers could provide back-end servers for companies of all types, with scale economics that not only lowered costs and increased flexibility, but which also justified far more investments in R&amp;D that were immediately deployable by said companies.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is no economic reason to ever leave this era, which leads many to assume we never will; services that are centralized work better for more people more cheaply, leaving no obvious product vector on which non-centralized alternatives are better. The exception is politics, and the point of that Article was to argue that we were entering a new era: the political era.</p>\n<p>Go back to the two points I raised above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a country, corporation, or individual assumes that the tech platforms of another country are acting in concert with their enemy, they are highly motivated to pursue alternatives to those tech platforms even if those platforms work better, are more popular, are cheaper, etc.</li>\n<li>If a country, corporation, or individual assumes that tech platforms are themselves engaged in political action, they are highly motivated to pursue alternatives to those tech platforms even if those platforms work better, are more popular, are cheaper, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, just to be crystal clear, these takeaways are true even if the intentions are pure, and the actions are just, because the question at hand is not about <em>intentions</em> but about <em>capabilities</em>. And while I get it can be hard to appreciate that distinction in the case of a situation like Ukraine, it&#8217;s worth noting that similar takeaways could be drawn from de-platforming controversies after January 6 and the attempts to control misinformation during COVID; if anything the fact that there are multiple object lessons in recent history of the willingness of platforms to both act in concert with governments and also of their own volition emphasizes the fact that from a realist perspective capabilities matter more than intentions, because the willingness to exercise those capabilities (to a widely varying degree, to be sure) has not been constrained to a single case.</p>\n<h4>India and Sanctions</h4>\n<p>The two countries where these questions are likely to loom largest are China and India.</p>\n<p>Start with the latter: India is widely considered the most important long-term growth market for a whole host of tech companies, thanks to its massive population that is only just now coming online, combined with a growing economy that, to the extent it can follow a similar path to China, promises more opportunity than anywhere else in the world. In the economic era it has made perfect sense for India to be a core market for Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.</p>\n<p>It was India, though, that raised some of the most strident objections to Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s decision to take down President Trump&#8217;s accounts after January 6, with several politicians pointing out that tech executives in San Francisco could do the same to them; in the case of the Ukraine invasion India is staying neutral, thanks in part to its significantly longer-term relationship with Russia, particularly from a military perspective. That makes it all-the-more likely that the aforementioned private sanctions are being interpreted in terms of capabilities, not intentions, clouding the long-term prospects of those tech companies counting on India for growth.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this isn&#8217;t an abstract idea for India: the country&#8217;s nuclear program was started in response to India&#8217;s defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War, but the country&#8217;s first nuclear test in 1974 led to sanctions from the United States, as did far more extensive tests in 1998. The United States also sailed a fleet into the Bay of Bengal during a conflict with Pakistan in 1971, shortly after India signed a treaty with the USSR, and the fleet was there to oppose India, not to support it. This matters not because it excuses India&#8217;s neutrality in the current conflict, but to explain why these private sanctions from U.S. tech companies may have different interpretations and unintended consequences in a market they were counting on.</p>\n<p>China is in a very different position, thanks to the long-run effects of the Great Firewall: U.S. consumer services companies obviously can&#8217;t sanction China, because China has already blocked them and built its own alternatives (one does wonder to what extent Moscow and perhaps even New Delhi look at the Great Firewall with jealousy). China&#8217;s problem — and potentially the West&#8217;s opportunity — lies with a far more fundamental piece of technology: semiconductors.</p>\n<h4>Semiconductors and China</h4>\n<p>China&#8217;s leading semiconductor foundry is the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation — SMIC for short. While the majority of SMIC&#8217;s volume is on older 55nm and 65nm process nodes, the company has a sizable and growing business at the extremely popular 28nm node. The company has also recently started mass production of 14nm and has demonstrated the ability to build 7nm chips. Even so, the most cutting edge companies in China have long been used to buying their chips abroad, whether that be Intel chips for servers or contracting with TSMC for everything else.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration took square aim at both vectors: in the case of the latter all American chip companies and companies that relied on American technology — which is to say, all of them, including TSMC — were barred from selling to Huawei, effectively killing the company&#8217;s smartphone business and severely damaging its telecom business. SMIC, meanwhile, has been barred from acquiring ASML&#8217;s cutting-edge extreme ultroviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are essential for building 7nm and below chips cost-effectively.</p>\n<p>What is notable in terms of this conflict is that China has given every appearance of supporting Russia (although the country, like India, abstained from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/un-general-assembly-set-censure-russia-over-ukraine-invasion-2022-03-02/\">the United Nations motion</a> to condemn Russia&#8217;s invasion). The big question in terms of Russian sanctions is just how far this support will go: on the one hand, working with Russia <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-chinas-banks-wont-come-to-russias-rescue-11646389803\">risks sanctions in the West</a>, which is a much larger market for China; this is a big deterrent for SMIC, which has a big opportunity to undercut TSMC in price on trailing edge nodes. Seizing that opportunity means sanctioning Russia; from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-01/u-s-expects-chinese-tech-firms-to-help-choke-off-russia-supply\">Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Washington is expected to lean on major Chinese companies from Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to Lenovo Group Ltd. to join U.S.-led sanctions against Russia, aiming to cripple the country’s ability to buy key technologies and components. China is Russia’s biggest supplier of electronics, accounting for a third of its semiconductor imports and more than half of its computers and smartphones. Beijing has opposed the increasingly severe measures that the U.S. has taken to restrict Russia’s trade and economy in response to its invasion of Ukraine, however U.S. officials expect tech suppliers such as SMIC to uphold the new rules and curtail trade of sensitive technology with American origin, especially as it relates to Russia’s defense sector.</p>\n<p>  Any items produced with certain U.S. inputs, including American software and designs, are subject to the ban, even if they are made overseas, a U.S. official told Bloomberg News on Monday. Companies that attempt to evade these new controls would face the prospect of themselves being cut off from U.S.-origin technology and corporate executives risk going to jail for violations…Beijing has made self-sufficiency in the semiconductor sector a national priority, but for now its tech companies still rely heavily on U.S. designs and technology. SMIC continues to use chipmaking equipment from American vendors including Applied Materials Inc. even after it got blacklisted by the U.S. in 2020. If the company fails to comply with U.S. sanctions, it could face tightening of restrictions that may make it more difficult or impossible to secure licenses for repair parts and new equipment.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>China, though, may be tempted by the prospect of resource-rich Russia being dependent on Beijing for a functioning economy, as well as the longer-term project of building economic and technical systems that are independent of the West. That could entail pushing SMIC to send chips to Russia in defiance of Western sanctions, with the thought being that short-term pain is worth the long-term gain. The risks of this approach are huge though: even if SMIC can&#8217;t get EUV, it can still get pretty far with deep ultraviolet (DUV), but <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-bar-investment-in-chinese-ai-giant-considers-banning-key-exports-to-top-chip-maker-11639092799\">the Biden administration is already pushing</a> to cut China off from any more of those machines as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The chip maker, SMIC, a year ago had been added to the entity list, which restricts companies from exporting U.S.-origin technology without a license. That, however, has proven ineffective in keeping many manufacturing tools used to make semiconductors out of SMIC’s hands, the people familiar said. Under the current designation, SMIC is restricted from buying U.S. tools “uniquely required” to build chips with 10-nanometer circuits and smaller, which is close to the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing technology. Since many manufacturing tools can be used to produce chips at a variety of sizes, exporters took the view that they were still able to sell tools that could be adjusted to produce the smaller chips and the restriction “became effectively language that means nothing,” one of the people said…</p>\n<p>  The Defense Department, with the support of officials at the State and Energy Departments, as well as the National Security Council, wants to change the wording to restrict SMIC’s access to items “capable of” producing semiconductors with 14-nanometer circuits and smaller, the people familiar said, broadening the list of items SMIC won’t be able to get.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is context for what may be the single biggest strategic question confronting the Biden administration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The U.S. has already damaged Huawei and constrained SMIC&#8217;s long-term prospects on the cutting edge, and there is a credible threat that the U.S. could further damage SMIC&#8217;s current capabilities.</li>\n<li>The U.S. doesn&#8217;t simply want SMIC to not sell to Russia, it also wants broader support from China for sanctions against Russia, particularly since China almost certainly has more influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin than any other country.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strategic choice is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The U.S. could relax sanctions on SMIC and address China&#8217;s broader semiconductor needs in exchange for cooperation on Russia, at the medium-term risk of increasing China&#8217;s technological capability (albeit with the upside of helping U.S. firms that undergird much of the semiconductor industry).</li>\n<li>Alternatively, the U.S. could simply pressure China to not sell to Russia, or even ratchet up pressure on SMIC, at the short-term risk of China taking a hit to its technological industry in exchange for supporting Russia and building an alternative to the U.S.-dominated world order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not an easy question, particularly in the heat of the current moment. China, not Russia, is the U.S.&#8217;s long-term strategic rival; more than that, though, is another long-term issue that very much has a semiconductor component: Taiwan.</p>\n<h4>Taiwan and Deterrence</h4>\n<p>While China has framed its refusal to condemn Russia mostly in terms of NATO expansion, it&#8217;s not hard to draw the obvious parallel to Taiwan: given that Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China that it has the right to take back, by military means if necessary, it&#8217;s understandable why China might view Russian rhetoric about Ukraine&#8217;s historical ties to Russia with sympathy; given this, it&#8217;s possible that China is going to support Russia no matter what. Moreover, this also raises questions about the wisdom of enhancing China&#8217;s technological capabilities with American-derived technology, given the high likelihood that said enhancement will go towards increased military capabilities.</p>\n<p>At the same time, cutting China off from TSMC has brought its own risks; I wrote in the context of Huawei <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/taiwan-and-techs-geopolitical-realities-arm-on-mac-tsmcs-choice/\">in 2020</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Should the United States and China ever actually go to war, it would likely be because of Taiwan. In this TSMC specifically, and the Taiwan manufacturing base generally, are a significant deterrent: both China and the U.S. need access to the best chip maker in the world, along with a host of other high-precision pieces of the global electronics supply chain. That means that a hot war, which would almost certainly result in some amount of destruction to these capabilities, would, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-chip-makers-including-intel-seek-semiconductor-self-sufficiency-11589103002\">as the Wall Street Journal notes</a>, be devastating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    Taiwan, China and South Korea “represent a triad of dependency for the entire U.S. digital economy,” said an influential 2019 Pentagon report on national-security considerations regarding the supply chain for microelectronics. “Taiwan, in particular, represents a single point-of-failure for most of the United States’ largest, most important technology companies,” said the report, written by Rick Switzer, who served as a senior foreign-policy adviser to an Air Force unit. He concluded that the U.S. needs to strengthen its industrial policies to address the situation.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  It’s the same for China, as I noted in that Daily Update about Huawei; one of the risks of cutting China off from TSMC is that the deterrent value of TSMC’s operations is diminished. At the same time, though, Taiwan — and South Korea, for that matter, where Samsung’s most advanced fabs are located — are a whole lot closer to China than they are to the U.S., and the location of land masses is not changing, at least on a time scale that is significant to this discussion!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This point applies to semiconductors broadly: as long as China needs U.S. technology or TSMC manufacturing, it is heavily incentivized to not take action against Taiwan; when and if China develops its own technology, whether now or many years from now, that deterrence is no longer a factor. In other words, the short-term and longer-term are in opposition to the medium-term:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The short-term upside of relaxing sanctions against China in semiconductors in exchange for supporting sanctions against Russia is a potentially earlier end to the conflict in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>The medium-term risk of giving China access to Western technology is that China develops more advanced products that could be used by its military.</li>\n<li>The long-term risk of cutting China off is the development of an alternative to the West that is completely unconstrained by sanctions, public or private.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no obvious answer, and it&#8217;s worth noting that the historical pattern — i.e. the Cold War — is a complete separation of trade and technology. That is one possible path, that we may fall into by default. It&#8217;s worth remembering, though, that dividers in the street are no way to live, and while most U.S. tech companies have flexed their capabilities, the most impressive tech of all is attractive enough and irreplaceable enough that it could still create dependencies that lead to squabbles but not another war.</p>\n<h4>Tech Power</h4>\n<p>The most powerful takeaway from the past ten days, though, at least from a tech perspective, is related to the nuclear question. To return to India, from the <a href=\"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaMomentum.html\">Nuclear Weapons Archive</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A most telling (and often quoted) exchange between [India Prime Minister Inder Kumar] Gujral and Pres. Clinton occurred on 22 September 1997 at the occasion of the U.N. General Assembly session in New York. Gujral later recounted telling Clinton that an old Indian saying holds that Indians have a third eye. &#8220;I told President Clinton that when my third eye looks at the door of the Security Council chamber it sees a little sign that says &#8216;only those with economic power or nuclear weapons allowed.&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;it is very difficult to achieve economic wealth&#8217;.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The implication is that nuclear capability was a more attainable route to great nation status than was economic dominance; what, then, to make of an industry that can, via private sanction, destroy economic wealth above and beyond government action? The capability wielded by the tech industry is incredible; it is easy to cheer when it is being used in the service of intentions that are so clearly good. It&#8217;s equally easy to understand how much fear that capability may generate in the long run.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Shopify&#8217;s Evolution</title>\n\t\t<link>https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 15:58:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stratechery.com/?p=8541</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Shopify should build an advertising business to complement Shop Pay and the Shopify Fulfillment Network]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tobi Lütke, who famously started Shopify when he realized that the software he built to run his snowboard shop was a much bigger opportunity than the shop itself, was reminiscing on Twitter about how cheap it used to be to run digital advertising:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">fun story: I had no one bidding against me on major ski resorts names with my snowboard ads in 2004.

One could, with a bit of trouble, open a merchant account and accept credit cards; 3PL warehouses could hold inventory; UPS and Fedex could deliver your goods. And, of course, you could run really cheap ads on Google. What was missing was software to tie all of those pieces together, which is exactly what Lütke built for Snowdevil, his snowboard shop, and in 2006 opened up to other merchants; the software&#8217;s name was called Shopify:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=640%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify started as the center of multiple third party services\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8547\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=1024%2C610&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?resize=1058%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1058w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This idea of Shopify as the hub for an e-commerce shop is one that has persisted to this day, but over the ensuing years Shopify has added on platform components as well; a platform looks like this (from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\">The Bill Gates Line</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=640%2C345&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of Platform Businesses Attract Customers by Third Parties\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3468\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?resize=1168%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1168w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first platform was the Shopify App Store, launched in 2009, where developers could access the Shopify API and create new plugins to deliver specific functionality that merchants might need. For example, if you want to offer a product on a subscription basis you might install <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments\">Recharge Subscriptions</a>; if you want help managing your shipments you might install <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/shipstation\">ShipStation</a>. Shopify itself delivers additional functionality through the Shopify App Store, like its <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/facebook\">Facebook Channel</a> plugin, which lets you easily sync your products to Facebook to easily manage your advertising.</p>\n<p>A year later Shopify launched the Shopify Theme Store, where merchants could buy a professional theme to make their site their own; now the hub looked like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=640%2C341&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify added two platforms for apps and themes\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8546\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=1024%2C545&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=768%2C409&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?resize=1184%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1184w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>At the same time Shopify also vertically integrated to incorporate features it once left to partners; the most important of these integrations was Shopify Payments, which launched in 2013 and was rebranded as Shop Pay in 2020. Yes, you could still use a clunky merchant account, but it was far easier to simply use the built-in Shop Pay functionality. Shop Pay was also critical in that it was the first part of the Shopify stack to build a consumer brand: users presented with a myriad of payment options know that if they click the purple Shop Pay button all of their payment and delivery information will be pre-populated, making it possible to buy with just one additional tap.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=640%2C336&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify integrated into payments with Shop Pay\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8548\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=768%2C404&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?resize=1198%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1198w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Even with this toehold in the consumer space, though, Shopify has remained a company that is focused first-and-foremost on its merchants and <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/about\">its mission</a> to &#8220;help people achieve independence by making it easier to start, run, and grow a business.&#8221; That independence doesn&#8217;t just mean one-person entrepreneurs either: good-size brands like Gymshark, Rebecca Minkoff, KKW Beauty, Kylie Cosmetics, and FIGS leverage Shopify to build brands that are independent of Amazon in particular.</p>\n<h4>Apple and Facebook</h4>\n<p>In 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/\">Apple and Facebook</a> I explained the symbiotic relationship between the two companies when it came to the App Store:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Facebook’s early stumbles on mobile are well-documented: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130414025919/http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/11/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-home.pr.fortune/\">the company bet on web-based apps</a> that just didn’t work very well; the company completely rewrote its iOS app even as it was going public, which meant it had a stagnating app at the exact time mobile was exploding, threatening the desktop advertising product and platform that were the basis of the company’s S-1.</p>\n<p>  The re-write turned out to be not just a company-saving move — the native mobile app had the exact same user-facing features as the web-centric one, with the rather important detail that it actually worked — but in fact an industry-transformational one: one of the first new products enabled by the company’s new app were app install ads. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/facebook-mobile-app-install-ads/\">From TechCrunch in 2012</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    Facebook is making a big bet on the app economy, and wants to be the top source of discovery outside of the app stores. The mobile app install ads let developers buy tiles that promote their apps in the Facebook mobile news feed. When tapped, these instantly open the Apple App Store or Google Play market where users can download apps.</p>\n<p>    The ads are working already. One client TinyCo saw a 50% higher click through rate and higher conversion rates compared to other install channels. Facebook’s ads also brought in more engaged users. Ads tech startup Nanigans clients attained 8-10X more reach than traditional mobile ad buys when it purchased Facebook mobile app install ads. AdParlor racked up a consistent 1-2% click through rate.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  Facebook’s App Install product quickly became the most important channel for acquiring users, particularly for games that monetized with Apple’s in-app purchase API: the combination of Facebook data with developer’s sophisticated understanding of expected value per app install led to an explosion in App Store revenue. \n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth underlining this point: the App Store would not be nearly the juggernaut it is today, nor would Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Services Narrative&#8221; be so compelling, were it not for the work that Facebook put in to build out the best customer acquisition engine in the industry (much to the company&#8217;s financial benefit, to be clear); Apple and Facebook&#8217;s relationship looked like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=640%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Apple and Facebook&#039;s symbiotic relationship\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8550\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=1024%2C605&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?resize=1067%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1067w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-7.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Facebook was by far the best and most efficient way to acquire new users, while Apple was able to sit back and harvest 30% of the revenue earned from those new users. Yes, some number of users came in via the App Store, but the primary discovery mechanism in the App Store is search, which relies on a user knowing what they want; Facebook showed users apps they never knew existed.</p>\n<h4>Facebook and Shopify</h4>\n<p>Facebook plays a similar role for e-commerce, particularly the independent sellers that exist on Shopify:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=640%2C345&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify&#039;s dependence on Facebook\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8545\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?resize=1169%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1169w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>What makes Facebook&#8217;s approach so effective is that its advertising is a platform in its own right. Just as every app on a smartphone or every piece of software on a PC shares the same resources and API, every advertiser on Facebook, from app maker to e-commerce seller and everyone in-between, uses the same set of APIs that Facebook provides. What makes this so effective, though, is that the  shared resources are not computing power but data, especially conversion data; I explained how this worked in 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/privacy-labels-and-lookalike-audiences/\">Privacy Labels and Lookalike Audiences</a>, but briefly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook shows a user an ad, and records the unique identifier provided by their phone (IDFA, Identifier for Advertisers, on iOS; GAID, Google Advertising Identifer, on Android).</li>\n<li>A user downloads an app, or makes an e-commerce purchase; Facebook&#8217;s SDK, which is embedded in the app or e-commerce site, again records the IDFA or notes the referral code that led the user to the site, and charges the advertiser for a successful conversion.</li>\n<li>The details around this conversion, whether it be which creative was used in the ad, what was purchased, how much was spent, etc., is added to the profile of the user who saw the ad.</li>\n<li>Advertisers take out new ads on Facebook asking the company to find users who are similar to users who have purchased from them before (Facebook knows this from past purchases seen by its SDK, or because an advertiser uploads a list of past customers).</li>\n<li>Facebook repeats this process, further refining its understanding of customers, apps, and e-commerce offerings in the process, including the esoteric ways (only discoverable by machine learnings) in which they relate to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The critical thing to understand about this process is that no one app or e-commerce seller stands alone; everyone has collectively deputized Facebook to hold all of the pertinent user data and to figure out how all of the pieces fit together in a way that lets each individual app maker or e-commerce retailer acquire new customers for a price less than what that customer is worth to them in lifetime value.</p>\n<p>This, by extension, means that Shopify doesn&#8217;t stand alone either: the company is even more dependent on Facebook to drive e-commerce than Apple ever was to drive app installs.<sup id=\"rf1-8541\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#fn1-8541\" title=\"While you can make purchases from brands in the Shop Pay app, it&#8217;s an insignificant channel that isn&#8217;t at all comparable to Apple&#8217;s own direct route to customers via the App Store.\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not a surprise that Facebook&#8217;s recent plunge in value was preceded (and then followed) by Shopify&#8217;s own:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=640%2C310&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify and Facebook&#039;s faltering stocks\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8544\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?resize=1200%2C581&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Part of Shopify&#8217;s decline is likely related to the fact that it is another pandemic stock: the sort of growth the company saw while customers were stuck at home with nothing to do other than shop online couldn&#8217;t go on forever. Moreover, the company announced big increases in spending (more on this in a moment). However, the major headwind the company shares with Facebook is Apple.</p>\n<h4>ATT&#8217;s Impact</h4>\n<p>I have been writing regularly about Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) initiative since it was announced two years ago, so I won&#8217;t belabor the point; the key thing to understand is that ATT broke the Facebook advertising collective. On the app install side this was done by technical means: Apple made the IDFA an opt-in behind a scary warning about tracking, which most users declined.</p>\n<p>The e-commerce side is more interesting: while Apple can&#8217;t technically limit what Facebook collects via its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel\">Pixel</a> on a retailer&#8217;s website, ATT bans said broad collection all the same. To that end Facebook <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/facebooks-ios-14-announcement-understanding-the-idfa-the-real-showdown/\">originally announced plans</a> to not show the ATT prompt and abandon the IDFA; a few months later <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-and-apple-continued-facebooks-ios-14-changes-georgia-and-tech/\">the company did an about-face</a> announcing that it would indeed show the ATT prompt, and also limit what it collected in its in-app browser via the Facebook Pixel.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear what happened to change Facebook&#8217;s mind; had they continued on their original path then their app advertising business would have suffered from a loss of data, but the e-commerce advertising would have been relatively unaffected (the loss of IDFA-related app install data would have decreased the amount of data available for that machine learning-driven targeting). What seems likely — and to be clear, this is pure speculation — is that Apple threatened to kick Facebook and its apps out of the App Store if it didn&#8217;t abide by ATT&#8217;s policies, even the parts that were technically unenforceable.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the net impact is that it was suddenly impossible for Facebook to tie together all of the various pieces of that virtuous cycle I described above deterministically. Ads were hard to tie to conversions, conversions were hard to tie to users, which meant that users and advertisers were hard to tie to each other, resulting in less relevant ads for the former that cost more money for the latter.<sup id=\"rf2-8541\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#fn2-8541\" title=\"Facebook&#8217;s advertising is sold on an auction basis, and advertisers often bid against desired outcomes, like conversions; the more difficult it is to target users the more users there are who need to be showed an ad, which increases demand for inventory, increasing prices.\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> The monetary impact is massive: Facebook forecast a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/metas-earnings-facebooks-three-challenges-financial-versus-existential-risks/\">$10 billion hit to 2022 revenue</a>, and as noted, its market value has been cut by a third.</p>\n<p>Note, however, that ATT didn&#8217;t hurt all advertisers: companies like Google and Amazon are doing great; I explained why in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/\">Digital Advertising in 2022</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Amazon’s advertising business has three big advantages relative to Facebook’s.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Search advertising is the best and most profitable form of advertising.</strong> This goes back to the point I made above: the more certain you are that you are showing advertising to a receptive customer, the more advertisers are willing to bid for that ad slot, and text in a search box will always be more accurate than the best targeting.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon faces no data restrictions.</strong> That noted, Amazon also has data on its users, and it is free to collect as much of it as it likes, and leverage it however it wishes when it comes to selling ads. This is because all of Amazon’s data collection, ad targeting, and conversion happen on the same platform — Amazon.com, or the Amazon app. ATT only restricts third party data sharing, which means it doesn’t affect Amazon at all.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon benefits from ATT spillover.</strong> That is not to say that ATT didn’t have an effect on Amazon: I noted above that Snap’s business did better than expected in part because its business wasn’t dominated by direct advertising to the extent that Facebook’s was, and that more advertising money flowed into other types of advertising. This almost certainly made a difference for Amazon as well: one of the most affected areas of Facebook advertising was e-commerce; if you are an e-commerce seller whose <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">Shopify store powered-by Facebook ads</a> was suddenly under-performing thanks to ATT, then the natural response is to shift products and advertising spend to Amazon.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>  All of these advantages will persist: search advertising will always be effective, and Amazon can always leverage data, and while some degree of ATT-related pullback was likely due to both uncertainty and the fact that Facebook hasn’t built back its advertising stack for a post-ATT world, the fact that said future stack will never be quite as good as the old one means that there is more e-commerce share to be grabbed than there might have been otherwise.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This last point is not set in stone: Shopify is already making major investments to compete with Amazon; it has the opportunity to do even more.</p>\n<h4>The Shopify Fulfillment Network</h4>\n<p>In 2019 I wrote about Shopify and its orthogonal competition with Amazon in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">Shopify and the Power of Platforms</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The difference is that Shopify is a platform: instead of interfacing with customers directly, 820,000 3rd-party merchants sit on top of Shopify and are responsible for acquiring all of those customers on their own.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=640%2C442&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of The Shopify Platform\" width=\"640\" height=\"442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4281\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?w=990&amp;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C530&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg?resize=913%2C630&amp;ssl=1 913w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  […]</p>\n<p>  This is how Shopify can both in the long run be the biggest competitor to Amazon even as it is a company that Amazon can’t compete with: Amazon is pursuing customers and bringing suppliers and merchants onto its platform on its own terms; Shopify is giving merchants an opportunity to differentiate themselves while bearing no risk if they fail.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The context of that Article was Shopify&#8217;s announcement of yet another platform initiative: the Shopify Fulfillment Network.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  From the company’s <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/unite-2019#5\">blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n    Customers want their online purchases fast, with free shipping. It’s now expected, thanks to the recent standard set by the largest companies in the world. Working with third-party logistics companies can be tedious. And finding a partner that won’t obscure your customer data or hide your brand with packaging is a challenge.</p>\n<p>    This is why we’re building Shopify Fulfillment Network—a geographically dispersed network of fulfillment centers with smart inventory-allocation technology. We use machine learning to predict the best places to store and ship your products, so they can get to your customers as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>    We’ve negotiated low rates with a growing network of warehouse and logistic providers, and then passed on those savings to you. We support multiple channels, custom packaging and branding, and returns and exchanges. And it’s all managed in Shopify.\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>  The first paragraph explains why the Shopify Fulfillment Network was a necessary step for Shopify: Amazon may commoditize suppliers, hiding their brand from website to box, but if its offering is truly superior, suppliers don’t have much choice. That was increasingly the case with regards to fulfillment, particularly for the small-scale sellers that are important to Shopify not necessarily for short-term revenue generation but for long-run upside. Amazon was simply easier for merchants and more reliable for customers.</p>\n<p>  Notice, though, that Shopify is not doing everything on their own: there is an entire world of third-party logistics companies (known as “3PLs”) that offer warehousing and shipping services. What Shopify is doing is what platforms do best: act as an interface between two modularized pieces of a value chain.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?resize=640%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of Shopify as an Interface\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4283\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?w=985&amp;ssl=1 985w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  On one side are all of Shopify’s hundreds of thousands of merchants: interfacing with all of them on an individual basis is not scalable for those 3PL companies; now, though, they only need to interface with Shopify. The same benefit applies in the opposite direction: merchants don’t have the means to negotiate with multiple 3PLs such that their inventory is optimally placed to offer fast and inexpensive delivery to customers; worse, the small-scale sellers I discussed above often can’t even get an audience with these logistics companies. Now, though, Shopify customers need only interface with Shopify.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the intervening three years, though, Shopify has moved away from this vision: Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) is not going to be a platform like the Shopify App Store but rather an integrated part of Shopify&#8217;s core offering like Shop Pay. President Harley Finkelstein explained on the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4487562-shopify-inc-shop-ceo-tobias-lutke-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript\">recent earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We are consolidating our network to larger facilities. We&#8217;ll operate more of them ourselves, and we&#8217;ll unify the warehouse management software that we&#8217;ve been building and testing over the past 18 months. We expect that these changes will enable us to deliver packages in 2 days or less to more than 90% of the U.S. population, while minimizing the inventory investment for SFN merchants. While Amy will go into more detail as to what our evolved vision looks like from a financial perspective, I can tell you, from a merchant&#8217;s perspective, Shopify Fulfillment can be life-changing for their businesses. We hear from merchants that fulfillment is only something you think about when it isn&#8217;t working well, and they are thrilled that they now never have to think about it. The stockouts and pre-orders that took the shine off strong demand for the new releases, largely became, I think, in the past, with Shopify Fulfillment. And just recently, I heard from a merchant who tells me that he sleeps even better because Shopify Fulfillment just works. Comments like these fuel our ambition, and we&#8217;ll continue to explore opportunities to give merchants more visibility and control over their most important assets.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Building and managing warehouses itself is a major commitment: Shopify is going to spend a billion dollars in capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024 building out the Shopify Fulfillment Network, and it seems safe to assume that that spending will only increase over time. I think, though, that this makes sense: Shopify learned from Shop Pay that it can decrease complexity for merchants and deliver a better experience for customers by doing essential functionality itself, and those same needs exist in logistics as well, particularly given Amazon&#8217;s massive investment in its own integrated operations.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, though, logistics isn&#8217;t the only advantage that Amazon has.</p>\n<h4>Shopify Advertising Services</h4>\n<p>Remember the fundamental challenge that ATT presents to Facebook: the company can no longer pool the conversion and targeting data of all of its advertisers such that the sum of effectiveness vastly exceeds what any one of those advertisers could accomplish on their own. The response of the gaming market has been <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/\">a wave of consolidation</a> to better pool and leverage data. Amazon, as noted, is well ahead of the curve here: because the company&#8217;s third-party merchant ecosystem lives within the Amazon.com website and app, Amazon has full knowledge of conversions and the ability to target consumers without any interference from Apple.</p>\n<p>Shopify is halfway there: a massive number of e-commerce retailers are on Shopify, but today Shopify mostly treats them all as individual entities, having left the pooling of data for advertising to Facebook. Now that Facebook is handicapped by Apple, Shopify should step up to provide substitute functionality and build its own advertising network.</p>\n<p>This advertising network, though, would look a bit different than what you might expect. First, Shopify doesn&#8217;t have any major customer-facing properties to display ads; it could potentially build some cross-shop advertising, but that doesn&#8217;t seem very ideal for either merchants or customers. The reality is that Shopify merchants still need to find customers on other sites like social networks; the challenge is doing so without knowing who is actually seeing the ads.</p>\n<p>Here Shopify&#8217;s ability to act on behalf of the entire Shopify network provides an opening: instead of being an advertising seller at scale, like Facebook, Shopify the company would become an advertising buyer at scale. Armed with its perfect knowledge of conversions it could run probabilistically-targeted campaigns that are much more precise than anyone else, using every possible parameter available to advertisers on Facebook or anywhere else, and over time build sophisticated cohorts that map to certain types of products and purchase patterns. No single Shopify merchant could do this on their own with a similar level of sophistication, which Facebook indirectly admitted on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4483754-meta-platforms-inc-s-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q4-2021-results-earning-call-transcript\">its recent earnings call</a>; COO Sheryl Sandberg said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  On measurement, there were 2 key areas within measurement, which were impacted as a result of Apple&#8217;s iOS changes. And I talked about this on the call last quarter as you referenced. The first is the underreporting gap. And what&#8217;s happening here is that advertisers worry they&#8217;re not getting the ROI they&#8217;re actually getting. On this part, we&#8217;ve made real progress on that underreporting gap since last quarter, and we believe we&#8217;ll continue to make more progress in the years ahead. I do want to caution that it&#8217;s easier to address this with large campaigns and harder with small campaigns, which means that part will take longer, and it also means that Apple&#8217;s changes continue to hurt small businesses more.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sandberg&#8217;s comment was primarily about the sheer amount of data produced by larger campaigns, but the same principle applies to the sheer number of campaigns as well: any one advertiser is, thanks to ATT, limited in the data points they can get from Facebook, making it more difficult to run multiple campaigns to better understand what works and what doesn&#8217;t. However, Shopify could in theory run campaigns for each of its individual merchants and collate the data on the back-end; this is the inverse of Amazon&#8217;s advantage of being one website, because in this case Shopify benefits from having a hand in such a huge number of them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I suspect the response of many close Shopify watchers is that such an initiative is not in the company&#8217;s DNA; that, though, is why the evolution of the Shopify Fulfillment Network is so notable: building and operating warehouses wasn&#8217;t really in the company&#8217;s DNA either, but it is the right thing to do if the company is going to continue to power <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">The Anti-Amazon Alliance</a>. The same principle applies to this theoretical ad network, particularly given that it is Amazon who is a big winner from Apple&#8217;s changes.</p>\n<p>What is interesting is that it appears that Shopify is already flirting with this idea:<sup id=\"rf3-8541\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/#fn3-8541\" title=\"Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eric_seufert&quot;&gt;Eric Seufert&lt;/a&gt; for tipping me off to this.\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> Last summer the company quietly introduced the concept of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dennishegstad/status/1406432771275472897\">Shopify Audiences</a> during an invite-only presentation; Tanay Jaipuria fleshed out the concept <a href=\"https://tanay.substack.com/p/shopify-audiences\">on Substack</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Shopify Audiences is a data exchange network, which uses aggregated conversion data (i.e., data around which people bought a merchant’s product) across all opted-in merchants on Shopify to generate a custom audience for a given merchant’s product. This audience is essentially a set of people Shopify believes are likely to be interested in your product given the data around all transactions that have taken place across all opted-in merchants on Shopify.</p>\n<p>  Merchants can then use these audiences when advertising on FB, Snap, Twitter, and other ad platforms1 either as custom audiences or lookalike audiences which should result in higher-performing ads and lower cost per conversion to acquire customers/sales.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a big step, and is very valuable for Facebook advertising in particular; however, it doesn&#8217;t address the Apple issue, because <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/apple-email-lists-cannot-be-used-for-ad-targeting/\">ATT bans custom and lookalike audiences from external data sources</a>. That means that Data Exchange can&#8217;t be used in any campaign targeting iOS users. That is why Shopify Audiences is only the first step: to make this work Shopify Audiences needs to become Shopify Advertising Services, where Shopify doesn&#8217;t just collect the targets but buys the ads to target them as well, in a way no one else in the world can.</p>\n<h4>The Conservation of Attractive Profits</h4>\n<p>Shopify Advertising Services, Shopify Fulfillment Network, and Shop Pay would, without question, result in a very different looking company than the one I sketched out at the beginning of this Article:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=640%2C366&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopify with integrated payments, fulfillment, and advertising\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8549\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=1024%2C586&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=768%2C440&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?resize=1100%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shopify-6.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This sort of monolith, though, makes sense not only because of the specifics of what is happening in the market, but from a theoretical perspective as well. I wrote another article about Shopify a year ago called <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/market-making-on-the-internet/\">Market-Making on the Internet</a>, highlighting how major consumer-facing platforms were increasingly incorporating Shopify into their sites and apps:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What makes the Shopify platform so fascinating is that over time more and more of the e-commerce it enables happens somewhere other than a Shopify website. Shopify, for example, can <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/sell-on-amazon\">help you sell on Amazon</a>, and in what will be <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-earnings-atts-impact-covid-vr-ar-and-optionality/\">an increasingly important channel</a>, Facebook Shops. In the latter case Facebook and Shopify are partnering to create a fully-integrated market: Facebook’s userbase and advertising tools on one side, and Shopify’s e-commerce management and seller base on the other. The broader takeaway, though, is that Shopify’s real value proposition is working across markets, not creating an exclusive one.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s motivations are clear: conversions in Facebook Shops can be tracked in a way conversions on websites no longer can be, which will result in in more effective advertising; it is to Shopify&#8217;s credit that they are seen as such an important and credible partner that Facebook is going as far as <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/shop-pay-on-google-and-facebook-shopifys-evolution-the-e-commerce-shift/\">incorporating Shop Pay as well</a>. Even so, this is very much an example of Facebook integrating and Shopify, as it must, modularizing to accommodate them.

Digital, though, is subject to the effects of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">Aggregation Theory</a>, a key component of which is winner-take-all dynamics, and Facebook and Google are indeed taking it all.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Article was prescient for a time; Yahoo has been passed around for peanuts, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/microsoft-and-apple-double-down/\">LinkedIn was bought by Microsoft</a> a few months later, and while Yelp and Twitter&#8217;s stock have more-or-less doubled since then,<sup id=\"rf1-8451\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#fn1-8451\" title=\"Twitter did have a large run-up a year ago that has since disappeared\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> that gain pales in comparison to that of Google and Facebook:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-1.png?resize=640%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Yelp&#039;s market gains over the last six years\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8452\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-1.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-1.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-1.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-1.png?resize=1200%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>That chart, though, only runs through last Wednesday; here is the new chart post-Facebook earnings:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-2.png?resize=640%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Yelp&#039;s market gains over the last six years, including Facebook&#039;s recent earnings\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-2.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-2.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-2.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-2.png?resize=1200%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>It turns out that, for now anyways, buying $TWTR on the day I wrote that article would have provided a better return than $FB.</p>\n<h4>Direct Response and the Collapse of the Funnel</h4>\n<p>In that Article I painted an idealized picture of the traditional marketing funnel and how Google and Facebook&#8217;s advertising products mapped onto it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What Sandberg is detailing here is really quite extraordinary: Facebook helped Shop Direct move customers through every part of the funnel: from awareness through Instagram video ads to consideration through retargeting and finally to conversion with dynamic product ads on Facebook (and, in the not too distant future, a direct customer relationship to build loyalty via Messenger).</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-reality-of-missing-out/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?resize=640%2C431&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A drawing of Digital Advertising 2.0\" width=\"640\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2026\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?resize=1024%2C689&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?resize=768%2C517&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?resize=936%2C630&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stratechery-Year-One-2711.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>  Google is promising something similar: awareness via properties like YouTube, consideration via DoubleClick, and conversion via AdSense. Just as importantly, both companies are promising that leveraging their respective platforms will provide benefits on both sides of the ROI equation: the return will be better given the two companies&#8217; superior targeting capabilities and ability to measure conversion, and the investment will be smaller because you can manage your entire funnel from a single ad-buying interface.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Herein lies the first thing that I got wrong: the traditional marketing funnel made sense in a world where different parts of the customer journey happened in different places — literally. You might see an advertisement on TV, then a coupon in the newspaper, and finally the product on an end cap in a store. Every one of those exposures was a discrete advertising event that culminated in the customer picking up the product in question in putting it in their (literal) shopping cart.</p>\n<p>On the Internet, though, that journey is increasingly compressed into a single impression: you see an ad on Instagram, you click on it to find out more, you login with Shop Pay, and then you wonder what you were thinking when it shows up at your door a few days later. The loop for apps is even tighter: you see an ad, click an &#8216;Install&#8217; button, and are playing a level just seconds later. Sure, there are things like re-targeting or list building, but by-and-large Internet advertising, particularly when it comes to Facebook, is almost all direct response.</p>\n<p>This can make for an exceptionally resilient business model: because the return-on-investment (ROI) of direct response advertising is measurable to a fantastically greater degree than traditional advertising measurement, advertisers can spend right up to the level they place on a particular customer or transaction&#8217;s value; Facebook, of course, is willing to help them do that as easily as possible, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/email-addresses-and-razor-blades/\">squeezing out margin in the process</a>. Moreover, because these ads are sold at auction, the company is insulated from events like COVID or boycotts; I explained in 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/\">Apple and Facebook</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.</p>\n<p>  In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a part.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problem for Meta is in the title of that article: Apple. The latter&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) initiative severed the connection amongst e-commerce sellers, app developers, and Facebook by which Facebook achieved that ROI, and while the company is better positioned than anyone else to build a replacement, it is important to note that the impairment entailed in probabilistically measuring ad effectiveness instead of deterministically is a permanent one.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just a Facebook problem: Snap said on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4484260-snap-inc-snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript\">its earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Our advertising partners who prefer to leverage lower-funnel goals such as in-app purchases, have been most impacted by [ATT]. We are seeing these advertisers migrate to mid-funnel goals where they have greater visibility such as install or click. Advertisers who optimize via web-based goal-based bids or GBBs have been less impacted, given that many of them have adopted the Snap pixel.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Snap&#8217;s direct response business is not nearly as good as Facebook&#8217;s, and is a much smaller business both overall and in terms of the overall company&#8217;s revenue; that left <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1489415020094324739\">a lot more cushion to absorb ATT</a>, both because Snap&#8217;s performance had less to lose, and also because the company&#8217;s brand-business could help pick up the slack. This, paradoxically, led many investors to overfit Facebook&#8217;s disappointing forecast to Snap&#8217;s outlook; the reality is that advertising dollars will find a way to be spent, and the alternatives to direct response on Snap were more impactful to the bottom line than they are on Facebook, in part because the latter was so dominant in direct response until now.</p>\n<h4>The Amazon Advertising IPO</h4>\n<p>What made the Facebook model tick was the way in which the company could convert conversion tracking to targeting: because Facebook knew a lot about someone who saw an ad and then converted, they could easily find other people who were similar — <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/privacy-labels-and-lookalike-audiences/\">lookalike audiences</a> — and show them similar ads, continually optimizing their targeting and increasing their understanding along the way.</p>\n<p>Google Search, though, has a built-in advantage: Google doesn&#8217;t have to figure out what you are interested in because you do the company the favor of telling it by searching for it. The odds that you want a hotel in San Francisco are rather high if you search for &#8220;San Francisco hotels&#8221;; it&#8217;s the same thing with life insurance or car mechanics or e-commerce.</p>\n<p>Google is not the only search engine that monetizes e-commerce effectively. Back in 2015 I described the breakout of Amazon Web Services&#8217; financials as <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/the-aws-ipo/\">The AWS IPO</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This is why Amazon’s latest earnings were such a big deal: for the first time the company broke out AWS into its own line item, revealing not just its revenue (which could be teased out previously) but also its profitability. And, to many people’s surprise, and despite all the price cuts, AWS is very profitable: $265 million in profit on $1.57 billion in sales last quarter alone, for an impressive (for Amazon!) 17% net margin.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those numbers pale in comparison to what I guess we might call the Amazon Advertising IPO, given that the company broke out its advertising for the first time this quarter, revealing $9.7 billion in revenue, a 32% increase year-over-year (Amazon did not break out the unit&#8217;s profitability). While that is still a fraction of Google&#8217;s $61.2 billion last quarter, or Facebook&#8217;s $32.6 billion, it is a larger fraction than you might expect, and several multiples of Snap&#8217;s $1.3 billion in revenue. Indeed, given the fact that Amazon is closer in revenue to Facebook than Facebook is to Google it seems fair to characterize the advertising market as dominated not by a big two but a big three.</p>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s advertising business has three big advantages relative to Facebook&#8217;s.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Search advertising is the best and most profitable form of advertising.</strong> This goes back to the point I made above: the more certain you are that you are showing advertising to a receptive customer, the more advertisers are willing to bid for that ad slot, and text in a search box will always be more accurate than the best targeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Amazon faces no data restrictions.</strong> That noted, Amazon <em>also</em> has data on its users, and it is free to collect as much of it as it likes, and leverage it however it wishes when it comes to selling ads. This is because all of Amazon&#8217;s data collection, ad targeting, and conversion happen on the same platform — Amazon.com, or the Amazon app. ATT only restricts third party data sharing, which means it doesn&#8217;t affect Amazon at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Amazon benefits from ATT spillover.</strong> That is not to say that ATT didn&#8217;t have an effect on Amazon: I noted above that Snap&#8217;s business did better than expected in part because its business wasn&#8217;t dominated by direct advertising to the extent that Facebook&#8217;s was, and that more advertising money flowed into other types of advertising. This almost certainly made a difference for Amazon as well: one of the most affected areas of Facebook advertising was e-commerce; if you are an e-commerce seller whose <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-anti-amazon-alliance/\">Shopify store powered-by Facebook ads</a> was suddenly under-performing thanks to ATT, then the natural response is to shift products and advertising spend to Amazon.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of these advantages will persist: search advertising will always be effective, and Amazon can always leverage data, and while some degree of ATT-related pullback was likely due to both uncertainty and the fact that Facebook hasn&#8217;t built back its advertising stack for a post-ATT world, the fact that said future stack will never be quite as good as the old one means that there is more e-commerce share to be grabbed than there might have been otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Google&#8217;s Dominance</h4>\n<p>Of course you could just as easily make an argument that when it comes to digital advertising there is Google and everyone else. Google clearly faces competition from Amazon for e-commerce search advertising — the European Commission&#8217;s Google Shopping case is only surpassed by the FTC&#8217;s Facebook lawsuit when it comes to overly narrow market definitions that ignore reality — but is dominant in terms of nearly every other vertical. Moreover, that dominance is shored up by the same factors favoring Amazon, at least in part.</p>\n<p>The first one is obvious: search advertising works great, and Google is the best at it.</p>\n<p>The second one, about data collection, is more interesting, particularly in the context of ATT. Facebook CFO Dave Wehner groused on <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Meta-Q4-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\">the company&#8217;s recent earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We believe the impact of iOS overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of $10 billion, so it&#8217;s a pretty significant headwind for our business. And we&#8217;re seeing that impact in a number of verticals. E-commerce was an area where we saw a meaningful slowdown in growth in Q4. And similarly, we&#8217;ve seen other areas like gaming be challenged. But on e-commerce, it&#8217;s quite notable that Google called out, seeing strength in that very same vertical. And so given that we know that e-commerce is one of the most impacted verticals from iOS restrictions, it makes sense that those restrictions are probably part of the explanation for the difference between what they were seeing and what we were seeing.</p>\n<p>  And if you look at it, we believe those restrictions from Apple are designed in a way that carves out browsers from the tracking prompts Apple requires for apps. And so what that means is that search ads could have access to far more third-party data for measurement and optimization purposes than app-based ad platforms like ours. So when it comes to using data, that it&#8217;s not really apples-to-apples for us. And as a result, we believe Google’s search ads business could have benefited relative to services like ours that face a different set of restrictions from Apple. And given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search ads, the incentive clearly exists for this policy discrepancy to continue.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Apple, it should be noted, has always treated the browser as a carve-out from its App Store restrictions (not that it has any choice: Apple, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/\">in contrast to the App Store</a>, doesn&#8217;t have any points of leverage over the open web), so it is fair to dismiss Wehner&#8217;s conspirational musings about the iPhone maker&#8217;s motivations.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the broader observation is a smart one: Google, thanks to the combination of being the default search engine on Safari and having a business built on the web, basically has first-party privileges on the iPhone when it comes to data. It can show ads to iPhone users on the default browser and track how those ads perform on third-party websites to a much greater extent than an app like Facebook directing users to the exact same third-party websites can.</p>\n<p>In terms of ATT, it is notable that the only part of Google&#8217;s business that fell short of Wall Street expectations was YouTube; I suspect it is not a coincidence that YouTube has a significant app-install business of its own, and ATT&#8217;s restrictions on what those installed apps can report back to Google may have hurt business a bit. At the same time, the same dynamics that drove advertising to other parts of Snap&#8217;s business and to Amazon advertising likely benefited Google as well, including Android.</p>\n<h4>Facebook Risk</h4>\n<p>There is no question that Facebook has been significantly impaired, but the company is by no means doomed, in large part because while search is very effective at finding what you want, there remains the need to make you aware of what you didn&#8217;t know existed. This is what Facebook excels at more than any other platform: by knowing who you are and what you have liked or purchased in the past, Facebook can place ads for products or apps you have never heard of in the Feed, in Stories, or, going forward in Reels.</p>\n<p>This, in my opinion, is actually a far more important form of advertising than search ads: yes, there are scenarios where a firm can surface something that fits exactly what you are searching for, but oftentimes search ads feel like <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-google-squeeze/\">a rake on organic results</a> that would have given you what you were looking for anyways. Facebook-style display advertising, on the other hand, is the foundation upon which an entirely new host of Internet-only businesses are built. These niche-focused companies are only possible when the entire world is your market, but they would founder without a way to find the customers who are looking for exactly what they have to offer; Facebook ads solve that problem.</p>\n<p>That discovery mechanism, though, doesn&#8217;t just depend on data; it also depends on attention. This is where the TikTok challenge looms large: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/metas-earnings-facebooks-three-challenges-financial-versus-existential-risks/\">Apple and ATT may have had the largest financial impact on Facebook, but TikTok and the loss of attention are the more existential risk</a>.</p>\n<h4>Illustrating the Ad Market</h4>\n<p>Still, Facebook&#8217;s forecast, disappointing as they were to investors, was for $27-29 billion in revenue this quarter; this is still a major player in an advertising market dominated by the three companies mentioned in this article, with one looming dark horse. To illustrate the market — and with the caveat that this is a <strong>massive</strong> oversimplification of what is a large and varied opportunity — consider a two-by-two defined by apps and commerce (both physical and digital) on one axis, and search and display on the other:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=640%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A two-by-two graph with search and display on one axis, and apps and commerce on the other\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8455\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?resize=851%2C630&amp;ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This is what that market looked like back in 2016:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=640%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The 2x2 graph in 2016, when Google and Facebook were dominant\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8456\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?resize=851%2C630&amp;ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This is what the market looks like in 2022:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=640%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The 2x2 graph in 2022, with challenges from Amazon and Apple\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8454\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?resize=851%2C630&amp;ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022advertising-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>First off, note that this illustration doesn&#8217;t include a huge part of Google&#8217;s market, which is basically search for anything other than e-commerce. It also doesn&#8217;t include the still substantial market for brand advertising. Direct response advertising, though, is the truly Internet-native advertising form, and while Google and Facebook are important, note the two new entrants who have substantial advantages:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon:</strong></p>\n<p>Amazon has the best fulfillment and logistics operation in e-commerce,<sup id=\"rf2-8451\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#fn2-8451\" title=\"ex-China, anyways\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> which it uses to not only drive its own first-party retail but also third-party merchant services. Indeed, this is another way to think about how Amazon is insulated from ATT: it&#8217;s not that the company doesn&#8217;t have a multitude of third-party merchants on its platform, it is that by taking on the role of an Aggregator <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">instead of a platform</a> it gets to fold all of those third party merchants into its app and website, beyond the limitations enforceable by Apple. Then it effectively gives those third party merchants no choice but to buy ads if they want to be noticed by customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Apple:</strong></p>\n<p>Apple launched its App Store advertising business in the fall of 2016, starting with the most obvious place: search. Apple hasn&#8217;t disclosed how much it makes in advertising, but there are analyst estimates of <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/apple-search-ads-revenue/423997/\">$5 billion annually</a>. Not all of this is search — Apple has since added inventory in the App Store&#8217;s &#8220;Suggested&#8221; section as well as owned-and-operated apps like Apple News — but most of it is; Apple is confined to the top right corner…for now.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest questions about the advertising landscape going forward is if Apple is going to move down to the &#8220;Apps + Discovery&#8221; quadrant that remains Facebook&#8217;s purview. If the company did they would have an unbeatable advantage: remember, Apple has made clear through its App Store policies and testimony in the Epic case that it views apps on the App Store as first party <em>for Apple</em> (this is how <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/apple-ads-and-the-anti-steering-argument-additional-follow-up/\">the company justifies its anti-steering provisions</a>, likening links to websites to putting up signs in its own store for another, even though the signs in question are in the app and not the App Store). It follows, then, that Apple would see no inconsistency in denying Facebook the ability to have knowledge about installation and conversions derived from a Facebook ad, even as Apple has perfect knowledge of those installations and conversions from its own ads.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a hypothetical! Apple&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-advertising/\">Advertising &amp; Privacy page</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We may use information such as the following to assign you to segments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Information: Your name, address, age, gender, and devices registered to your Apple ID account. Information such as your first name in your Apple ID registration page or salutation in your Apple ID account may be used to derive your gender. You can update your account information on the Apple ID website.</li>\n<li>Downloads, Purchases &amp; Subscriptions: The music, movies, books, TV shows, and apps you download, as well as any in-app purchases and subscriptions. We don’t allow targeting based on downloads of a specific app or purchases within a specific app (including subscriptions) from the App Store, unless the targeting is done by that app’s developer.</li>\n<li>Apple News and Stocks: The topics and categories of the stories you read and the publications you follow, subscribe to, or enable notifications from.</li>\n<li>Advertising: Your interactions with ads delivered by Apple’s advertising platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  When selecting which ad to display from multiple ads for which you are eligible, we may use some of the above-mentioned information, as well as your App Store searches and browsing activity, to determine which ad is likely to be most relevant to you. App Store browsing activity includes the content and apps you tap and view while browsing the App Store. This information is aggregated across users so that it does not identify you. We may also use local, on-device processing to select which ad to display, using information stored on your device, such as the apps you frequently open.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, Apple does not currently allow developers to target downloads or purchases from within a specific app the developer does not own,<sup id=\"rf3-8451\"><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#fn3-8451\" title=\"This is why I have been intrigued by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2021/interoperability-defined-applovin-files-s-1-the-facebook-shopify-value-chain/&quot;&gt;AppLovin&#8217;s approach&lt;/a&gt;.\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> but that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple cannot; again, the company has made clear it sees every app on the iPhone — especially their purchases — as Apple data, and this document makes very clear that Apple only sees data collection as problematic when it involves third parties. To that end, Apple could set up an auction-based advertising network that monetized on a per-install basis and run those ads within an Apple-controlled network that is available to third-party apps. It would basically be a better version of Facebook — well, in theory, Apple has admittedly never been really good at this sort of thing — but since only Apple sees the data (just as only Facebook sees the data from third-party apps), Apple gets to pat itself on the back all of the way to the bank.</p>\n<p>This would, needless to say, be a breathtaking example of anti-competitive behavior; kneecapping your competitor via platform control and then taking over their business is what one would think antitrust law would be designed to stop. But then you look up and Apple has gotten away with its App Store policies for years, and Facebook is getting sued for limiting competition even as it faces an existential threat from TikTok, and who knows, maybe it would work.</p>\n<p>I hinted at one of the objections to this happening above: Apple has tried to do advertising before, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-scales-back-iads-the-apple-news-mess/\">and failed miserably</a>. As any Apple aficionado will tell you, ads aren&#8217;t in their nature, products are. But then again, had you told those same aficionados that Apple would be facing developer ire, antitrust lawsuits, and regulatory obstacles all over the world because of its insistence that it is owed 15-30% of all digital content consumed on the iPhone, they probably would have said that was impossible too. What is clear is that the $10 billion in revenue that Facebook won&#8217;t see this year will go somewhere, and Apple&#8217;s Services Narrative has never felt like a bigger opportunity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is a broader takeaway to this discussion; I wrote in the conclusion of 2020&#8217;s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/\">The End of the Beginning</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In other words, today’s cloud and mobile companies — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google — may very well be the GM, Ford, and Chrysler of the 21st century. The beginning era of technology, where new challengers were started every year, has come to an end; however, that does not mean the impact of technology is somehow diminished: it in fact means the impact is only getting started.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was one company conspicuous in its absence, and that was Facebook. Real power in technology comes from rooting the digital in something physical: for Amazon that is its fulfillment centers and logistics on the e-commerce side, and its data centers on the cloud side. For Microsoft it is its data centers and its global sales organization and multi-year relationships with basically every enterprise on earth. For Apple it is the iPhone, and for Google is is Android and its mutually beneficial relationship with Apple (this is less secure than Android, but that is why Google is paying an estimated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/05/google-pays-apple-stay-out-of-search/\">$15 billion</a> annually — and growing — to keep its position). Facebook benefited tremendously from being <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/mobile-makes-facebook-just-an-app-thats-great-news/\">just an app</a>, but the freedom of movement that entailed meant taking a dependency on iOS and Android, and Apple has exploited that dependency in part, if not yet in full.</p>\n<p>This, more than anything, is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-problem-with-virtual-reality/\">the way to understand the Meta bet</a>, and why <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/meta/\">it matters so much to CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Investors may want the company to focus on what it is best at; Zuckerberg wants to build a company that is truly independent of anyone.</p>\n<p><em>I wrote a follow-up to this Article in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-follow-up-spotify-rogan-follow-up/\">this Daily Update</a>.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes\"><ol class=\"footnotes\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li id=\"fn1-8451\"><p >Twitter did have a large run-up a year ago that has since disappeared&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#rf1-8451\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 1.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2-8451\"><p >ex-China, anyways&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#rf2-8451\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 2.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn3-8451\"><p >This is why I have been intrigued by <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/interoperability-defined-applovin-files-s-1-the-facebook-shopify-value-chain/\">AppLovin&#8217;s approach</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/#rf3-8451\" class=\"backlink\" title=\"Return to footnote 3.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"
