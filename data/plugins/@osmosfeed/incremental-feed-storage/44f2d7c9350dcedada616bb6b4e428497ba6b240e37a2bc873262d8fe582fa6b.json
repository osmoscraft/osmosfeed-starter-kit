So I admit that I was riding on a fake ticket. In the spot, I ate in a cheap bar in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariensztat\">Mariensztat</a>, where one meal had to be enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I remember it was a rhubarb soup and a thin macaroon. It was the only thing I could do.”</p>\n<p>“The scholarship was absolutely not enough for me. I also used to smoke cigarettes. I had no choice but to earn some extra money somewhere. In the second year, thanks to a friend, we won orders in a scientific and technical publishing house for the design of book covers, and when we were in the third year, it was this publishing house that announced a nationwide competition for a graphic sign. I had no idea about this area of ​​design, so I would go to the library and see what these characters look like, what they are. I tried and sent a few proposals for the competition. It was attended by an older generation of pre-war graphic artists who were still working and doing beautiful things. When I saw their works next to mine at the post-competition exhibition I was extremely ashamed. How could I send such scribbles?! It had nothing to do with a professionally designed sign, it was some kind of smear on a napkin in a coffee shop.”</p>\n<p>You can read more of this time in Karol’s life, and how his energy turned from painting to design, in an insightful interview on <a href=\"https://weekend.gazeta.pl/weekend/7,177333,22815308,karol-sliwka-leonarda-i-michala-aniola-poznalem-dzieki-ksiazkom.html\">weekend.gazeta.pl</a> (in Polish, I used Chrome’s translate).

A commitment to my profession, my discipline, and my nation led me to want to fill those gaps, so we founded an <a href=\"https://lapatria.uy/\">archive of Uruguayan graphic design</a> on July 10, 2018.” — <a href=\"https://benderski.design\">Amijai Benderski</a></p>\n<p>I was surprised to see <a href=\"https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/stories/people/edward-johnston-man-behind-londons-lettering\">Edward Johnston</a>’s 1918 London Underground logo in the mix. Turns out he was born in Uruguay before his Scottish parents moved back across the ocean to England when he was just three.</p>\n<p>The Underground roundel is one of Amijai’s favourites. In his words, “What I idolise about the accomplishment of Edward Johnston is that it is an everlasting design that has transformed into a symbol of British culture.”</p>\n\n<img width=\"1000\"

design history.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that Uruguayan design is under-represented, I know it is. In my opinion, this happens because there lacks a narration of our history where a tale is constructed.</p>\n<p>“For example, I learned about our graphic design background when I was in my thirties. This shows that there is a problem where me and my colleagues didn’t create a report of the history where shared.</p>\n<p>“The main objective of the archive is to enable design students to be aware of our heritage as soon as they start studying our vocation. La Patria will help to raise awareness of what was designed in our territory.”</p>\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\"

      "content_text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 1,000 items in the collection. As well as logos you’ll find historical posters, stamps, book and record covers.\n“There have been few attempts to narrate or document Uruguayan design tradition; because of this, the country appears to lack a design history. A commitment to my profession, my discipline, and my nation led me to want to fill those gaps, so we founded an archive of Uruguayan graphic design on July 10, 2018.” — Amijai Benderski\nI was surprised to see Edward Johnston’s 1918 London Underground logo in the mix. Turns out he was born in Uruguay before his Scottish parents moved back across the ocean to England when he was just three.\nThe Underground roundel is one of Amijai’s favourites. In his words, “What I idolise about the accomplishment of Edward Johnston is that it is an everlasting design that has transformed into a symbol of British culture.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Lamont interviewed Amijai for Design Reviewed and asked if he felt Uruguayan design is under-represented in design history.\n“I don’t feel that Uruguayan design is under-represented, I know it is. In my opinion, this happens because there lacks a narration of our history where a tale is constructed.\n“For example, I learned about our graphic design background when I was in my thirties. This shows that there is a problem where me and my colleagues didn’t create a report of the history where shared.\n“The main objective of the archive is to enable design students to be aware of our heritage as soon as they start studying our vocation. La Patria will help to raise awareness of what was designed in our territory.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more on the worthy endeavour visit The Daily Heller, and the site itself La Patria.",

It’s an independent award scheme by designer Kyle Courtright. Kyle and I have yet to meet in person, but we’ve come to know each other online over the years and I have a lot of respect for him as a family man and as a designer. Kyle kindly answered some questions to give us an insight into the awards.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you want to start a logo competition?</strong></p>\n<p>Like many ideas, Logo Wave was born out of necessity. I wanted to enter my own work into a logo awards competition and felt frustrated with the antiquated and drawn-out submission process. At that point, I knew I wanted to start a design awards to help support my fellow creatives, and I had three criteria out of the gate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Must be centered around logos</li>\n<li>Must encourage and give value to creatives</li>\n<li>Must fill a gap in the design awards space</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After feeling like each of those boxes had the potential to be checked (and getting the green light from my wife), I decided to move forward. We launched in June of 2016.</p>\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Calvary Church logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6198,6196,6197\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6198,6196,6197\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo.jpg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n<img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Crib Genie logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6198,6196,6197\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6198,6196,6197\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo.jpeg 1800w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-1200x1200.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" />\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Mujahid logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6198,6196,6197\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6198,6196,6197\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo.jpeg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n\n<p><strong>You describe Logo Wave as a “reimagined” awards platform. What sets it apart?</strong></p>\n<p>1. The “Wave” structure</p>\n<p>The wave model sets us apart. There are usually 3–4 waves per year (each lasting 3–4 months). Other design awards tend to run one annual competition.</p>\n<p>Freelancers and studios upload their best logo work from their design portfolios and when the wave’s complete our jury carefully reviews the entries and determines the <a href=\"https://logowave.com/wave-winners/ref/20/\">winners</a>. When one wave ends a new one begins, like waves in the ocean.</p>\n<p>2. Massive prize bundle</p>\n<p>Our prize pack includes $1,000 USD, custom-crafted bamboo trophies, a one year membership to <a href=\"https://www.logolounge.com\">LogoLounge</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.logopackage.com\">Logo Package Express</a> extension, a winner certificate, recognition on the Logo Wave website, additional network exposure, and more.</p>\n<p>3. The investment</p>\n<p>We’re one of the most affordable design awards and we’ve intentionally maintained a wallet-friendly, prize-heavy platform.</p>\n<p>4. Internationally acclaimed jury</p>\n<p>We have been fortunate enough to bring on a jury of design authors who genuinely care about moving our profession forward. People who love being a part of recognising and celebrating design.

Level playing field</p>\n<p>We’ve intentionally created a competition where freelancers, studios, and agencies alike have the chance to heighten their credibility and recognition. The platform was built by designers for designers, with the heart behind the brand being to give creatives a credible, exciting boost of social proof.</p>\n<p>6. User-friendly and fun</p>\n<p>Part of reimagining the awards space meant creating a user-friendly competition. As I mentioned, this was a big pain point from experiences with other design awards. We’re mindful that busy designers don’t have time to fill out long, drawn-out forms, so a simple, straightforward entry process was important.</p>\n<p>While we have an expectation of excellence, we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We want designers to have fun as we help to celebrate and shine a spotlight on their work, offering great prizes along the way.</p>\n<p>7. Value-add</p>\n<p>Logo Wave exists to help designers and studios secure a greater percentage of bids, land more consistently qualified clients, and raise their rates as a result of added credibility and value.</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you see as your competition (other design/logo awards)?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s interesting to see <a href=\"https://competition.adesignaward.com\">A’ Design Award</a> and the platform they’ve built. <a href=\"https://designawards.core77.com\">Core77</a> is doing some nice things as well!</p>\n<p><strong>Did you set any goals at the beginning, or have you reached any milestones that have helped keep you going?</strong></p>\n<p>Initial entries were mostly from freelancers. After a brand refresh, increased cash prize, additional trophies with an updated design, and increased brand recognition, there has been a seismic evolution in the audiences we’ve attracted. The number of studios and agencies deciding to take part has greatly increased in line with the value and credibility of the brand.</p>\n\n<img width=\"901\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo.png\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Art as Therapy logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6201,6202,6203\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6201,6202,6203\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo.png 901w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-300x300.png 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-700x699.png 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-150x150.png 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-768x767.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px\" />\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Baby Zebra logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6201,6202,6203\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6201,6202,6203\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo.jpeg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Tiki Tonga Coffee logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6201,6202,6203\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6201,6202,6203\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo.jpeg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n\n<p>I’m grateful to every designer who’s reached out over the years to say Logo Wave has helped level-up their business. That encouragement is part of why I love building the brand. Here’s just a couple of testimonials:</p>\n<p>“Logo Wave has been <em>the</em> catalyst in helping me win more large, qualified branding and identity gigs. With their top-tier jury, $1,000/trophy prize, and more than reasonable entry fee, this one is a no-brainer.”<br />\n&#8211; Costa Mamangakis, <a href=\"https://orfikdesign.com\">Orfik Design</a></p>\n<p>“Winning Logo Wave helped my studio generate new business leads and secure new clients as a result.”<br />\n&#8211; Filippos Pente, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/Mistershot\">Mistershot</a></p>\n<p>Those are the kind of stories that keep me trucking along.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anything proved more difficult than expected? Any plans to change the awards in future?</strong></p>\n<p>In early 2020, I was on the cusp of rolling out a membership/subscription option. Feedback from designers was overwhelmingly positive and I was excited for the big launch. Unfortunately, I realised that I didn’t have the time or infrastructure in place for the roll-out, so needed to pump the brakes. That was pretty tough on me. I put a lot of time and effort into its creation, all while running an <a href=\"https://courtrightdesign.com\">independent graphic design business</a>. With a commitment to my wife and three kiddos that I’d limit work to 40–45 hours per week I needed to put things on hold until I had right people in place.</p>\n<p>My vision is to pivot Logo Wave into more of a designer ecosystem. Members will have access to our job board with qualified and primarily remote logo/branding/identity gigs. We’ll also have a community forum where like-minded branding designers can support each other and access exclusive discounts on design-centric products such as Adobe CC, Dribbble, etc. and other perks/resources. We’ll still have the logo awards as the cornerstone, with the prizes and recognition that offers.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the time of this writing, I’ve slowly added new team members and I’m hopeful for a 2023 beta launch of the new membership experience. Designers can reach out <a href=\"https://logowave.com/contact/ref/20/\">here</a> to be a part of our beta.</p>\n<p>I’ve also learned that I have a heart for students and less-experienced creatives. I want to give the next generation a chance to stand out in a crowded marketplace. And this is how <a href=\"https://logowave.com/students/ref/20/\">Logo Wave Students</a> came to be.</p>\n<p>It’s structured differently. In short, we’ve partnered with universities to bring the competition to the classroom. Whether it’s helping final year students land their dream studio job, or helping attract qualified clients to their independent design businesses, the mission is to make a positive impact on the careers of design students across the globe.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you had any issues with the making or supply of your trophies?</strong></p>\n<p>We had difficult experiences with our first two trophy providers. Items not delivered on time, suppliers forgetting to engrave the winners names, poor customer experience. The list goes on.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Katie Totheroh and the team at <a href=\"https://www.awardingyou.com\">Awarding You</a> came along as a breath of fresh air.

      "content_text": "\n\nI’ve been judging the Logo Wave awards for a number of years now. It’s an independent award scheme by designer Kyle Courtright. Kyle and I have yet to meet in person, but we’ve come to know each other online over the years and I have a lot of respect for him as a family man and as a designer. Kyle kindly answered some questions to give us an insight into the awards.\nWhat made you want to start a logo competition?\nLike many ideas, Logo Wave was born out of necessity. I wanted to enter my own work into a logo awards competition and felt frustrated with the antiquated and drawn-out submission process. At that point, I knew I wanted to start a design awards to help support my fellow creatives, and I had three criteria out of the gate:\n\nMust be centered around logos\nMust encourage and give value to creatives\nMust fill a gap in the design awards space\n\nAfter feeling like each of those boxes had the potential to be checked (and getting the green light from my wife), I decided to move forward. We launched in June of 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou describe Logo Wave as a “reimagined” awards platform. What sets it apart?\n1. The “Wave” structure\nThe wave model sets us apart. There are usually 3–4 waves per year (each lasting 3–4 months). Other design awards tend to run one annual competition.\nFreelancers and studios upload their best logo work from their design portfolios and when the wave’s complete our jury carefully reviews the entries and determines the winners. When one wave ends a new one begins, like waves in the ocean.\n2. Massive prize bundle\nOur prize pack includes $1,000 USD, custom-crafted bamboo trophies, a one year membership to LogoLounge, the Logo Package Express extension, a winner certificate, recognition on the Logo Wave website, additional network exposure, and more.\n3. The investment\nWe’re one of the most affordable design awards and we’ve intentionally maintained a wallet-friendly, prize-heavy platform.\n4. Internationally acclaimed jury\nWe have been fortunate enough to bring on a jury of design authors who genuinely care about moving our profession forward. People who love being a part of recognising and celebrating design. Virtuosos like Louise Fili, David Airey, Gail Anderson, Chris Do, Alina Wheeler, Jacob Cass, Debbie Millman, and Bill Gardner have graced our panel over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Level playing field\nWe’ve intentionally created a competition where freelancers, studios, and agencies alike have the chance to heighten their credibility and recognition. The platform was built by designers for designers, with the heart behind the brand being to give creatives a credible, exciting boost of social proof.\n6. User-friendly and fun\nPart of reimagining the awards space meant creating a user-friendly competition. As I mentioned, this was a big pain point from experiences with other design awards. We’re mindful that busy designers don’t have time to fill out long, drawn-out forms, so a simple, straightforward entry process was important.\nWhile we have an expectation of excellence, we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We want designers to have fun as we help to celebrate and shine a spotlight on their work, offering great prizes along the way.\n7. Value-add\nLogo Wave exists to help designers and studios secure a greater percentage of bids, land more consistently qualified clients, and raise their rates as a result of added credibility and value.\nWho do you see as your competition (other design/logo awards)?\nIt’s interesting to see A’ Design Award and the platform they’ve built. Core77 is doing some nice things as well!\nDid you set any goals at the beginning, or have you reached any milestones that have helped keep you going?\nInitial entries were mostly from freelancers. After a brand refresh, increased cash prize, additional trophies with an updated design, and increased brand recognition, there has been a seismic evolution in the audiences we’ve attracted. The number of studios and agencies deciding to take part has greatly increased in line with the value and credibility of the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to every designer who’s reached out over the years to say Logo Wave has helped level-up their business. That encouragement is part of why I love building the brand. Here’s just a couple of testimonials:\n“Logo Wave has been the catalyst in helping me win more large, qualified branding and identity gigs. With their top-tier jury, $1,000/trophy prize, and more than reasonable entry fee, this one is a no-brainer.”\n– Costa Mamangakis, Orfik Design\n“Winning Logo Wave helped my studio generate new business leads and secure new clients as a result.”\n– Filippos Pente, Mistershot\nThose are the kind of stories that keep me trucking along.\nHas anything proved more difficult than expected? Any plans to change the awards in future?\nIn early 2020, I was on the cusp of rolling out a membership/subscription option. Feedback from designers was overwhelmingly positive and I was excited for the big launch. Unfortunately, I realised that I didn’t have the time or infrastructure in place for the roll-out, so needed to pump the brakes. That was pretty tough on me. I put a lot of time and effort into its creation, all while running an independent graphic design business. With a commitment to my wife and three kiddos that I’d limit work to 40–45 hours per week I needed to put things on hold until I had right people in place.\nMy vision is to pivot Logo Wave into more of a designer ecosystem. Members will have access to our job board with qualified and primarily remote logo/branding/identity gigs. We’ll also have a community forum where like-minded branding designers can support each other and access exclusive discounts on design-centric products such as Adobe CC, Dribbble, etc. and other perks/resources. We’ll still have the logo awards as the cornerstone, with the prizes and recognition that offers.\nFast forward to the time of this writing, I’ve slowly added new team members and I’m hopeful for a 2023 beta launch of the new membership experience. Designers can reach out here to be a part of our beta.\nI’ve also learned that I have a heart for students and less-experienced creatives. I want to give the next generation a chance to stand out in a crowded marketplace. And this is how Logo Wave Students came to be.\nIt’s structured differently. In short, we’ve partnered with universities to bring the competition to the classroom. Whether it’s helping final year students land their dream studio job, or helping attract qualified clients to their independent design businesses, the mission is to make a positive impact on the careers of design students across the globe.\nHave you had any issues with the making or supply of your trophies?\nWe had difficult experiences with our first two trophy providers. Items not delivered on time, suppliers forgetting to engrave the winners names, poor customer experience. The list goes on.\nIn 2021, Katie Totheroh and the team at Awarding You came along as a breath of fresh air. They’ve been outstanding, taking the custom trophy design I created and producing a perfect replica. Their turnaround times, quality of work, and communication have been superb.\n\n\n\nHow can designers enter the awards?\nUpload your logos here, 900 x 900px on a white background, and you’re all set. We get an average of three logos per designer/studio, per wave, and the maximum upload amount is ten. Here are the entry details and other relevant info.\n—\nIt’s a pleasure to be part of the esteemed jury, Kyle, and here’s to much success with the membership launch.\nLogo credit:\nCalvary Church, by Logan Brazeau\nCrib Genie, by Adolfo Teixeira\nMujahid, by Shyam Agarwal\nPenguin Brand, by Francesco Vittorioso\nFox Stevenson, by Samadara Ginige\nKieran Hawes, self-designed\nArt as Therapy, by Nothing\nBaby Zebra, by Mr Simc\nTiki Tonga Coffee, by John Vingoe",

He learned Spanish to be able to translate Lorca from his mother tongue. From 1949–55 he studied at IDGSA Painting Department in Istanbul, graduating from Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu Workshop.</p>\n<p>As a side job between 1955 and 1960 Maden designed logos, billboard displays, theatre decors, and cinema posters. It wasn’t until after 1960 when he focused on the graphic design discipline, concentrating mainly on publication design. He designed around 8,000 book and magazine covers for many publishing houses, as well as periodicals, brochures, packaging, labels, and around 500 logos. He crafted some of the fonts used in his books, and was the designer of many political election posters. In 1964 he established his own private workshop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01.jpg\" alt=\"Sait Maden photo\" width=\"700\" height=\"789\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5916\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01-266x300.jpg 266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/168229518?h=8ed78ebb57&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<em>Trailer for the Sait Maden documentary by <a href=\"https://www.miracguldogan.com\">Miraç Güldoğan</a>.</em></p>\n<p>He was among the founders of the Graphic Artists Association in 1969, spending a period as chairman of the association. In 1979, in an effort to document the history of Turkish graphic design, Sait started the book project “Turkish Graphic Art from the Beginning to the Present.” This would be the first book of its kind for his country. Although he couldn’t complete the book due to a lack of time and support, parts of the project were published in the “Graphic Art” magazine, and a section was published in the journal “Cevre.” Sait’s attention to the lack of design awareness in Turkey and his comments on the absence of a graphic designer in the museum are thought to explain the lack of support for his work.</p>\n\n<img

      "content_text": "\n\nBorn on May 3rd, 1931, in Çorum, Turkey, Sait Maden started writing poetry at the age of 13 and began learning French and Ottoman at the age of 16. He learned Spanish to be able to translate Lorca from his mother tongue. From 1949–55 he studied at IDGSA Painting Department in Istanbul, graduating from Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu Workshop.\nAs a side job between 1955 and 1960 Maden designed logos, billboard displays, theatre decors, and cinema posters. It wasn’t until after 1960 when he focused on the graphic design discipline, concentrating mainly on publication design. He designed around 8,000 book and magazine covers for many publishing houses, as well as periodicals, brochures, packaging, labels, and around 500 logos. He crafted some of the fonts used in his books, and was the designer of many political election posters. In 1964 he established his own private workshop.\n\n\nTrailer for the Sait Maden documentary by Miraç Güldoğan.\nHe was among the founders of the Graphic Artists Association in 1969, spending a period as chairman of the association. In 1979, in an effort to document the history of Turkish graphic design, Sait started the book project “Turkish Graphic Art from the Beginning to the Present.” This would be the first book of its kind for his country. Although he couldn’t complete the book due to a lack of time and support, parts of the project were published in the “Graphic Art” magazine, and a section was published in the journal “Cevre.” Sait’s attention to the lack of design awareness in Turkey and his comments on the absence of a graphic designer in the museum are thought to explain the lack of support for his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSait collated his logo designs for his book titled “Simgeler” (Icons) published in 1990.

As founder and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine, he employed an illustrator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Robinson_Sykes\">Charles Sykes</a>, and a private secretary, <a href=\"https://www.beaulieu.co.uk/news/women-in-motorsport-social-history-eleanor-thornton/\">Eleanor Velasco Thornton</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1909, Lord Montagu commissioned Sykes (who was also a sculptor) to make a mascot for his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Sykes produced a statue of a young woman in fluttering robes, which he named “The Whisper.” The figure is holding a finger to her lips, which some claim is a reference to Lord Montagu’s close relationship with Eleanor. Others suggest, more prosaically, that it relates to the engine’s quietness.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"The Whisper, Rolls-Royce, Charles Sykes\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5893\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5893\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-700x435.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-768x477.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-1200x746.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>Whatever the truth, The Whisper went on to adorn every Montagu Rolls-Royce. Soon, other owners were having their own ornaments made, much to the displeasure of Rolls-Royce general managing director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Johnson\">Claude Johnson</a>. In 1910, Johnson commissioned Sykes to make an official mascot to protect the company’s products from these unsightly additions. Sykes subtly reinterpreted The Whisper, and created what become known as the Spirit of Ecstasy.</p>\n\n<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Charles Sykes Spirit of Ecstasy\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5878\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5878\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01.jpg 2000w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-700x490.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1536x1075.jpg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1200x840.jpg 1200w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1860x1302.jpg 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" />\n\n<p>Challenging the social conventions of the time, her appearance became instantly iconic, leaning into the wind, arms outstretched, her dress billowing as if in flight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04.jpg\" alt=\"Spirit of Ecstasy\" width=\"700\" height=\"992\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5887\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04-212x300.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Charles Sykes made the mascots from February 1911, until his daughter, Jo, took over in 1928. Jo, the only child of Charles and Jessica Sykes, made the mascots from then until 1939, and has written that her mascot production was about seven per week. This suggests that only about forty percent of the Rolls-Royce cars manufactured between 1911 and 1939 were ordered with mascots (an optional extra). We know that the Sykes’ ceased mascot manufacture after 1939 but most pre-WWII Rolls-Royce cars seen today wear mascots. That would mean that perhaps half of the mascots now on these cars are copies, not made by Charles or his daughter.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Spirit of Ecstasy\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5886\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5886\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>The most common question asked by Rolls-Royce owners is whether their mascot is original. The answer depends on what’s defined as “original.” Charles Sykes’ master models are obviously original. From these he made copies, usually four. He then used these as masters to make agar jelly moulds from which in turn he cast wax patterns to be used to make castings. He then polished these castings and sold them to Rolls-Royce to be put on cars. Almost everyone would call these last original, even though they are copies of copies of Sykes’ original sculpture.</p>\n<p>In recent years the emblem was carefully redrawn by Marina Willer’s team at <a href=\"https://www.pentagram.com/work/rolls-royce-3/story\">Pentagram</a> in London.</p>\n\n<img width=\"2236\" height=\"1319\"

      "content_text": "\n\nLord Montagu of Beaulieu was one of Britain’s motoring pioneers. As founder and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine, he employed an illustrator, Charles Sykes, and a private secretary, Eleanor Velasco Thornton.\nIn 1909, Lord Montagu commissioned Sykes (who was also a sculptor) to make a mascot for his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Sykes produced a statue of a young woman in fluttering robes, which he named “The Whisper.” The figure is holding a finger to her lips, which some claim is a reference to Lord Montagu’s close relationship with Eleanor. Others suggest, more prosaically, that it relates to the engine’s quietness.\n\n\n\nWhatever the truth, The Whisper went on to adorn every Montagu Rolls-Royce. Soon, other owners were having their own ornaments made, much to the displeasure of Rolls-Royce general managing director Claude Johnson. In 1910, Johnson commissioned Sykes to make an official mascot to protect the company’s products from these unsightly additions. Sykes subtly reinterpreted The Whisper, and created what become known as the Spirit of Ecstasy.\n\n\n\nChallenging the social conventions of the time, her appearance became instantly iconic, leaning into the wind, arms outstretched, her dress billowing as if in flight.\n\nCharles Sykes made the mascots from February 1911, until his daughter, Jo, took over in 1928. Jo, the only child of Charles and Jessica Sykes, made the mascots from then until 1939, and has written that her mascot production was about seven per week. This suggests that only about forty percent of the Rolls-Royce cars manufactured between 1911 and 1939 were ordered with mascots (an optional extra). We know that the Sykes’ ceased mascot manufacture after 1939 but most pre-WWII Rolls-Royce cars seen today wear mascots. That would mean that perhaps half of the mascots now on these cars are copies, not made by Charles or his daughter.\n\n\n\nThe most common question asked by Rolls-Royce owners is whether their mascot is original. The answer depends on what’s defined as “original.” Charles Sykes’ master models are obviously original. From these he made copies, usually four. He then used these as masters to make agar jelly moulds from which in turn he cast wax patterns to be used to make castings. He then polished these castings and sold them to Rolls-Royce to be put on cars. Almost everyone would call these last original, even though they are copies of copies of Sykes’ original sculpture.\nIn recent years the emblem was carefully redrawn by Marina Willer’s team at Pentagram in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe static interpretation was combined with Pentagram’s “expression generator,” adding some flexibility, freshness, and distinction to the Rolls-Royce identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, each Spirit of Ecstasy ornament is cast in Southampton, England, and can be produced in 24-carat gold, sterling silver, glass, stainless steel, and even illuminated. The Black Badge cars feature a black Spirit of Ecstasy, and for security the figurine retracts when the ignition is turned off.\n\n\n\nIt’s still unclear whether The Whisper or the Spirit of Ecstasy were truly based on Eleanor Thornton. Either way, Eleanor would never see her likeness achieve global fame. In 1915, she was killed when the P&O liner SS Persia, on which she and Lord Montagu were travelling to India, was torpedoed off the coast of Crete by a German U-boat.\nEleanor Thornton, copyright Motoring Picture Gallery\nCharles Sykes never spoke publicly about Eleanor, while his daughter Jo confined herself to saying, “Eleanor was a lovely person.

Along with his brother John S Candler, John Pemberton’s former partner (and logo designer) Frank Robinson, and two other associates, Asa formed a Georgia corporation named <a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com\">The Coca-Cola Company</a>.

He was the first bottler of Coca-Cola.</p>\n<p>By 1895 Coca-Cola was drunk in every state.</p>\n<p>The first celebrity to be featured in Coca-Cola advertising was model and music hall singer, Hilda Clark (below).

      "content_text": "\n\nIt was May 8th, 1886, in Atlanta, Georgia, when Coca-Cola came to life. Local pharmacist Dr John Stith Pemberton created the syrup.\nJohn Stith Pemberton (1831–1888)\nJohn carried a jug of his syrup down the street to Jacobs’ Pharmacy where it was mixed with carbonated water, deemed tasty, and sold from a soda fountain for five cents a glass.\n\n\n\nTo understand where the brand name came from we need to go back a little further, to the 1860s when John Pemberton created Coca Wine, an alcoholic drink “for fatigue of mind and body.”\n\nA prohibition law was enacted in Atlanta in 1886, persuading John to rename and rewrite the formula for his popular Coca Wine stimulant, sold at the time by most, if not all, of the city’s pharmacies.\nJohn’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, suggested the Coca-Cola name, thinking that “the two Cs would look well in advertising.”\nThe first known use of the Coca-Cola logo was in an advertisement in the Atlanta Journal on May 29th, 1886. The logo was an all uppercase serif, and the ad invited people to try “the new and popular soda fountain drink, containing the properties of the wonderful Coca plant and the famous Cola nuts.”\n\nAn average of nine drinks per day were sold during the first year.\nFrank Robinson wanted the brand name to have a visual style of its own, so experimented with an elaborate Spencerian script, a form of penmanship that was characteristic of the time. There was unanimous consensus on the script logo among those working for the Pemberton company.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola’s is believed to be the first coupon ever offered in the US, first distributed in 1887 (although the “Trade Mark Registered” tag in the tail of the “C” shown above didn’t appear until a few years later).\nJohn never realised the potential of the drink he created, and gradually sold portions of his business to various partners. Just before John’s death in 1888, he sold his remaining interest in Coca-Cola to Atlanta-born Asa G Candler, who proceeded to buy additional rights to gain complete control over the business.\nAsa Griggs Candler (1851–1929)\nOn May 1st, 1889, Asa Candler published a full-page advertisement in The Atlanta Journal, proclaiming his wholesale and retail drug business as “sole proprietors of Coca-Cola… Delicious. Refreshing. Exhilarating. Invigorating.” Sole ownership, which Asa did not actually achieve until 1891, cost a total of $2,300.\nAn 1891 calendar (below) shows a version of the Coca-Cola logo at the top-right that only existed for a year. The logo at the top-left was for De-Lec-Ta-Lave — a mouthwash also owned by Asa Candler.\n\n\nIn March, 1892, Asa’s merchandising flair resulted in an almost ten-fold sales increase of the soft drink. He soon liquidated his pharmaceutical business and focused his full attention on Coca-Cola. Along with his brother John S Candler, John Pemberton’s former partner (and logo designer) Frank Robinson, and two other associates, Asa formed a Georgia corporation named The Coca-Cola Company. Initial capital was $100,000.\nIn 1894, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Joseph A Biedenharn was so impressed by the growing demand for Coca-Cola at his soda fountain that he installed bottling machinery in the rear of his store and began to sell cases of the drink to farms and lumber camps up and down the Mississippi River. He was the first bottler of Coca-Cola.\nBy 1895 Coca-Cola was drunk in every state.\nThe first celebrity to be featured in Coca-Cola advertising was model and music hall singer, Hilda Clark (below). She was featured on calendars, serving trays, metal advertising signs, posters, bookmarks, note pads, and various ephemera from the late 1890s to 1904.\n\n\n\nA glass of Coca-Cola was available for just 5¢ from 1886 all the way until 1959.\nHilda Clark and “The ideal brain tonic“ (1890s)\nShown below is the first ever magazine ad for Coca-Cola. The full-page spread featured Lillian Nordica and ran in Good Housekeeping and other leading magazines of the day. A promo coupon for a free drink was attached to the bottom of the ad. Nearly $43,000 worth of coupons were redeemed in 1905 — the equivalent of roughly $1,300,000 in 2021.\nFeaturing opera singer Lillian Nordica (1905)\nCoca-Cola poster ad (1909)\n“Sometime today you’ll be about all in. Feel as if you’d like to toss up the whole thing and just rest — but you can’t. When that time comes snatch a moment from your work — seek the nearest soda fountain and get a glass of delicious and refreshing Coca-Cola. It will relieve your fatigue, cool you off comfortably, calm your jangled nerves, and quench the thirst.”\nCoke bottle design (1894–1975)\nStraight-sided containers were used up until 1915, but as soft-drink competition intensified, so did imitation, and in early 1916 the Coca-Cola bottlers approved the unique contour bottle designed by the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\n\n\nNicknamed the “hobbleskirt,” due to the resemblance of the skirt-style in 1910, the historic bottle was derived from the shape of a cocoa bean, elongated with distinct ribs.\nCoca-Cola Hot Dog! ad (1919)\nIn 1919, the Candler interests sold The Coca-Cola Company to Atlanta banker Ernest Woodruff and an investor group for $25 million. The business was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation, and 500,000 shares of its common stock were sold publicly for $40 per share.\nThe red disc era (from 1930s)\nThe logo within a red circle began appearing in the early 1930s. It’s been widely used through the decades and in more recent years.\nIn 1945 “Coke” was registered as a trademark with the USPTO.\nCoca-Cola “Coke” ad (1947)\nAn arched “fishtail” surround could be seen on signage and vending machines for a few years in the late 50s and early 60s, but it was dropped in favour of a return to the earlier red circle.\n\n\n\nCoke Santa and terrier (1961)\nIn 1969 the “Arden Square” logo was unveiled. In a red box, the Coca-Cola script was underlined with a white “wave” or “dynamic ribbon device” that’s still used today.\nThe “Arden Square” (introduced in 1969)\nThe “Arden Square” with McDonald’s (1972)\nBy 2004 The Coca-Cola Company owned nearly 400 brands in almost every country, with seventy percent of income coming from outside the US. At the time of writing, the company has 2,061 trademark applications, including a trademark for the now-familiar bottle shape — a very rare option for packaging.\n\n\n\nToday, Frank Robinson’s elaborate handwritten design is one of the most recognisable logos in the world.\nSources:\n\nTrace the 130-year evolution of the Coca-Cola logo\nThe chronicle of Coca-Cola: birth of a refreshing idea\nThe first glass of Coca-Cola is served\nThe Coca-Cola logo story\nVintage Coca-Cola advertising\nVintage Coke / Coca-Cola advertising\nThe evolution of the Coca-Cola logo\nHow did the Coca-Cola bottle get its contour shape?\nThe Root family and Coca-Cola\n\nYou might like Jonathan Mak’s Sharing a Coke visual.",

Everything a passionate designer does is guided by design. My life is tied together by design. The commercial work, the socially focused work, my home and surroundings, my paintings, collages, and assemblages all come from my love for design and my aesthetic sensibility. Passion is the key.

      "content_text": "\n\nDuring its first ten years Pirtle Design produced some of the most celebrated graphic design work of the time. That work included identities and marketing material for Baylor University Medical Center, The Dallas Museum of Art, TGI Friday’s, Dallas Opera, Diamond Shamrock Corporation, Centex Homes, and Simpson Paper Company, to name a few.\nIn 1988, aged 44, Woody became a partner in the New York office of Pentagram, the international design consultancy founded in London in 1972. From then until 2005 Woody worked on some of the firm’s most prestigious projects, with clients such as Brown-Forman, Bacardi Global Brands, IBM, Champion International Corporation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Knoll International, Princeton University, Brooklyn Law School, Amnesty International, and many others.\nIn a UCDA interview Woody was asked where the Pentagram name came from.\n“Because the names of the five founders were cumbersome when listed together, they had to find a name that would continue to represent the firm even if one or more of the partners left or if a new partner was added. Pentagram was a provocative choice and of course makes a direct reference to five. And no, we are not a satanic cult!”\nWoody was awarded the AIGA Medal in 2003 before leaving Pentagram in 2005 so he could re-establish Pirtle Design.\nPhoto credit\nA few designs stand out from Woody’s logos and symbols, such as this personal mark for Mr and Mrs Aubrey Hair (1976).\n\n\n\nAnd this monogram for Railex (1984).\n\n\n\nFor his logo for Fine Line Features (1991), a division of New Line Cinema, the “F” and clapboard become one.\n\n\n\nThis next one for the artist Ward Schumaker is my favourite, where a seemingly simple flip of the “R” and “D” creates a beautifully relevant and distinctive wordmark.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if there had ever been a job offer that he didn’t accept, Woody replied, “Sometimes there are products that you don’t like or feel are not socially responsible.

      "content_text": "\n\nOn April 26th, 1986, events at Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant changed the world (the Chernobyl mini-series was a dark, fascinating watch). Many people know about the tragedy, but far fewer know that the cities of Chornobyl Exclusion Zone are gradually disappearing, being destroyed by neglect and absorbed by nature. This means that over time no one will be able to see the consequences of the man-made disaster.\n\n\n\n\nKiev-based creative agency Banda toured the Exclusion Zone, and the impression made by the disappearing cities was so strong that they began negotiations with the Zone’s representatives. The logo was designed with the support of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine, the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, and the State Agency for Tourism Development.\n\n\n\n“More than a year ago we began our work on the Zone’s new branding and we created the vanishing logo. This idea most accurately communicated the situation with the disappearing cities. Then lockdown happened and it wasn’t the right time to show the update. No one would be able to go to Chornobyl due to quarantine restrictions. Now Chornobyl is again open to tourists, so we can finally share the results of our cooperation.”\n\n\n\nThe form of the logo is based on the shape of the fourth reactor — the place where it all began. Every year the Chornobyl logo changes, becoming lighter in weight until the end point of its existence in 2064 when the Chornobyl Power Plant will be completely decommissioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanda created a visual identity around the logo, and just like the mark, the various designed items change each year on April 26th. Banda hopes that these changes create collectors items, while sharing a reminder of how the past always influences the present.\n\n\n\nThe chornobyl.today website was designed by Other Land and developed by Orient.\n\n\n\nMore from Banda.",

I said I would learn, and it happened.”</p>\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Karol Sliwka self portrait, 1952\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"6301\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6301\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952.jpg 1600w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952-700x525.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karol-sliwka-self-portrait-1952-1200x900.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\n\n<p>His education continued at the State Secondary School of Art Techniques, graduating with a diploma in 1953. He would later pass entry exams for the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, graduating in 1959.</p>\n<p>“I went to Warsaw with only a few zlotys with me, which my mother gave me for a roll, but that was not enough for food or for the train. So I admit that I was riding on a fake ticket. In the spot, I ate in a cheap bar in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariensztat\">Mariensztat</a>, where one meal had to be enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I remember it was a rhubarb soup and a thin macaroon. It was the only thing I could do.”</p>\n<p>“The scholarship was absolutely not enough for me. I also used to smoke cigarettes. I had no choice but to earn some extra money somewhere. In the second year, thanks to a friend, we won orders in a scientific and technical publishing house for the design of book covers, and when we were in the third year, it was this publishing house that announced a nationwide competition for a graphic sign. I had no idea about this area of ​​design, so I would go to the library and see what these characters look like, what they are. I tried and sent a few proposals for the competition. It was attended by an older generation of pre-war graphic artists who were still working and doing beautiful things. When I saw their works next to mine at the post-competition exhibition I was extremely ashamed. How could I send such scribbles?! It had nothing to do with a professionally designed sign, it was some kind of smear on a napkin in a coffee shop.”</p>\n<p>You can read more of this time in Karol’s life, and how his energy turned from painting to design, in an insightful interview on <a href=\"https://weekend.gazeta.pl/weekend/7,177333,22815308,karol-sliwka-leonarda-i-michala-aniola-poznalem-dzieki-ksiazkom.html\">weekend.gazeta.pl</a> (in Polish, I used Chrome’s translate). Or if you prefer to listen and watch, there’s an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7SNPdj-DKz0\">interview</a> on YouTube that’s very well pieced together, first aired (I think) during the <a

A commitment to my profession, my discipline, and my nation led me to want to fill those gaps, so we founded an <a href=\"https://lapatria.uy/\">archive of Uruguayan graphic design</a> on July 10, 2018.” — <a href=\"https://benderski.design\">Amijai Benderski</a></p>\n<p>I was surprised to see <a href=\"https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/stories/people/edward-johnston-man-behind-londons-lettering\">Edward Johnston</a>’s 1918 London Underground logo in the mix. Turns out he was born in Uruguay before his Scottish parents moved back across the ocean to England when he was just three.</p>\n<p>The Underground roundel is one of Amijai’s favourites. In his words, “What I idolise about the accomplishment of Edward Johnston is that it is an everlasting design that has transformed into a symbol of British culture.”</p>\n\n<img width=\"1000\"

design history.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that Uruguayan design is under-represented, I know it is. In my opinion, this happens because there lacks a narration of our history where a tale is constructed.</p>\n<p>“For example, I learned about our graphic design background when I was in my thirties. This shows that there is a problem where me and my colleagues didn’t create a report of the history where shared.</p>\n<p>“The main objective of the archive is to enable design students to be aware of our heritage as soon as they start studying our vocation. La Patria will help to raise awareness of what was designed in our territory.”</p>\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\"

href=\"https://logowave.com/ref/20/\">Logo Wave</a> awards for a number of years now. It’s an independent award scheme by designer Kyle Courtright. Kyle and I have yet to meet in person, but we’ve come to know each other online over the years and I have a lot of respect for him as a family man and as a designer. Kyle kindly answered some questions to give us an insight into the awards.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you want to start a logo competition?</strong></p>\n<p>Like many ideas, Logo Wave was born out of necessity. I wanted to enter my own work into a logo awards competition and felt frustrated with the antiquated and drawn-out submission process. At that point, I knew I wanted to start a design awards to help support my fellow creatives, and I had three criteria out of the gate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Must be centered around logos</li>\n<li>Must encourage and give value to creatives</li>\n<li>Must fill a gap in the design awards space</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After feeling like each of those boxes had the potential to be checked (and getting the green light from my wife), I decided to move forward. We launched in June of 2016.</p>\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Calvary Church logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6198,6196,6197\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6198,6196,6197\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo.jpg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calvary-church-logo-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n<img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Crib Genie logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6198,6196,6197\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6198,6196,6197\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo.jpeg 1800w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crib-genie-logo-1200x1200.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" />\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Mujahid logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6198,6196,6197\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6198,6196,6197\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo.jpeg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mujahid-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n\n<p><strong>You describe Logo Wave as a “reimagined” awards platform. What sets it apart?</strong></p>\n<p>1. The “Wave” structure</p>\n<p>The wave model sets us apart. There are usually 3–4 waves per year (each lasting 3–4 months). Other design awards tend to run one annual competition.</p>\n<p>Freelancers and studios upload their best logo work from their design portfolios and when the wave’s complete our jury carefully reviews the entries and determines the <a href=\"https://logowave.com/wave-winners/ref/20/\">winners</a>. When one wave ends a new one begins, like waves in the ocean.</p>\n<p>2. Massive prize bundle</p>\n<p>Our prize pack includes $1,000 USD, custom-crafted bamboo trophies, a one year membership to <a href=\"https://www.logolounge.com\">LogoLounge</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.logopackage.com\">Logo Package Express</a> extension, a winner certificate, recognition on the Logo Wave website, additional network exposure, and more.</p>\n<p>3. The investment</p>\n<p>We’re one of the most affordable design awards and we’ve intentionally maintained a wallet-friendly, prize-heavy platform.</p>\n<p>4. Internationally acclaimed jury</p>\n<p>We have been fortunate enough to bring on a jury of design authors who genuinely care about moving our profession forward. People who love being a part of recognising and celebrating design.

Level playing field</p>\n<p>We’ve intentionally created a competition where freelancers, studios, and agencies alike have the chance to heighten their credibility and recognition. The platform was built by designers for designers, with the heart behind the brand being to give creatives a credible, exciting boost of social proof.</p>\n<p>6. User-friendly and fun</p>\n<p>Part of reimagining the awards space meant creating a user-friendly competition. As I mentioned, this was a big pain point from experiences with other design awards. We’re mindful that busy designers don’t have time to fill out long, drawn-out forms, so a simple, straightforward entry process was important.</p>\n<p>While we have an expectation of excellence, we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We want designers to have fun as we help to celebrate and shine a spotlight on their work, offering great prizes along the way.</p>\n<p>7. Value-add</p>\n<p>Logo Wave exists to help designers and studios secure a greater percentage of bids, land more consistently qualified clients, and raise their rates as a result of added credibility and value.</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you see as your competition (other design/logo awards)?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s interesting to see <a href=\"https://competition.adesignaward.com\">A’ Design Award</a> and the platform they’ve built. <a href=\"https://designawards.core77.com\">Core77</a> is doing some nice things as well!</p>\n<p><strong>Did you set any goals at the beginning, or have you reached any milestones that have helped keep you going?</strong></p>\n<p>Initial entries were mostly from freelancers. After a brand refresh, increased cash prize, additional trophies with an updated design, and increased brand recognition, there has been a seismic evolution in the audiences we’ve attracted. The number of studios and agencies deciding to take part has greatly increased in line with the value and credibility of the brand.</p>\n\n<img width=\"901\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo.png\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Art as Therapy logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6201,6202,6203\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6201,6202,6203\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo.png 901w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-300x300.png 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-700x699.png 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-150x150.png 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/art-as-therapy-logo-768x767.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px\" />\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Baby Zebra logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6201,6202,6203\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6201,6202,6203\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo.jpeg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/baby-zebra-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Tiki Tonga Coffee logo\" loading=\"lazy\" size=\"full\" link=\"none\" ids=\"6201,6202,6203\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6201,6202,6203\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo.jpeg 900w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiki-tonga-coffee-logo-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" />\n\n<p>I’m grateful to every designer who’s reached out over the years to say Logo Wave has helped level-up their business. That encouragement is part of why I love building the brand. Here’s just a couple of testimonials:</p>\n<p>“Logo Wave has been <em>the</em> catalyst in helping me win more large, qualified branding and identity gigs. With their top-tier jury, $1,000/trophy prize, and more than reasonable entry fee, this one is a no-brainer.”<br />\n&#8211; Costa Mamangakis, <a href=\"https://orfikdesign.com\">Orfik Design</a></p>\n<p>“Winning Logo Wave helped my studio generate new business leads and secure new clients as a result.”<br />\n&#8211; Filippos Pente, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/Mistershot\">Mistershot</a></p>\n<p>Those are the kind of stories that keep me trucking along.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anything proved more difficult than expected? Any plans to change the awards in future?</strong></p>\n<p>In early 2020, I was on the cusp of rolling out a membership/subscription option. Feedback from designers was overwhelmingly positive and I was excited for the big launch. Unfortunately, I realised that I didn’t have the time or infrastructure in place for the roll-out, so needed to pump the brakes. That was pretty tough on me. I put a lot of time and effort into its creation, all while running an <a href=\"https://courtrightdesign.com\">independent graphic design business</a>. With a commitment to my wife and three kiddos that I’d limit work to 40–45 hours per week I needed to put things on hold until I had right people in place.</p>\n<p>My vision is to pivot Logo Wave into more of a designer ecosystem. Members will have access to our job board with qualified and primarily remote logo/branding/identity gigs. We’ll also have a community forum where like-minded branding designers can support each other and access exclusive discounts on design-centric products such as Adobe CC, Dribbble, etc. and other perks/resources. We’ll still have the logo awards as the cornerstone, with the prizes and recognition that offers.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the time of this writing, I’ve slowly added new team members and I’m hopeful for a 2023 beta launch of the new membership experience. Designers can reach out <a href=\"https://logowave.com/contact/ref/20/\">here</a> to be a part of our beta.</p>\n<p>I’ve also learned that I have a heart for students and less-experienced creatives. I want to give the next generation a chance to stand out in a crowded marketplace. And this is how <a href=\"https://logowave.com/students/ref/20/\">Logo Wave Students</a> came to be.</p>\n<p>It’s structured differently. In short, we’ve partnered with universities to bring the competition to the classroom. Whether it’s helping final year students land their dream studio job, or helping attract qualified clients to their independent design businesses, the mission is to make a positive impact on the careers of design students across the globe.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you had any issues with the making or supply of your trophies?</strong></p>\n<p>We had difficult experiences with our first two trophy providers. Items not delivered on time, suppliers forgetting to engrave the winners names, poor customer experience. The list goes on.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Katie Totheroh and the team at <a href=\"https://www.awardingyou.com\">Awarding You</a> came along as a breath of fresh air.

James doesn’t hold back on sharing his sketches. I’m positive that’s what contributed to his huge <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/made.by.james/\">Instagram</a> appeal, too, because there’s an insight you get from sketches that can’t be seen in any other part of a design project.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211206_130921.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full

Their ‘thing’ at the time had been the whole “alien” vibe (remember, we are talking 1991). So, I had been creating loads of designs based around the letter ‘A’ which got knocked back. Richard, having seen the work in progress, liked where I was going with the amorphic shape and from these I developed what is now the Aphex ‘A.’ The logo was finished early 1992, in time to appear on the ‘Xylem Tube’ sleeve.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pictograms.blogspot.com/2007/11/logo-111-aphex-twin.html\">Quote source</a>.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xylem-tube-aphex-twin-cover-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Xylem Tube Aphex Twin cover\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"6149\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6149\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xylem-tube-aphex-twin-cover-01.jpg 1200w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xylem-tube-aphex-twin-cover-01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xylem-tube-aphex-twin-cover-01-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xylem-tube-aphex-twin-cover-01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xylem-tube-aphex-twin-cover-01-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" />\n\n<p>The monogram was lifted from a larger wordmark in the same style, but it was always the symbol that was star of the show.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aphex-twin-logo-wordmark-01.jpg\" alt=\"Aphex Twin wordmark\" width=\"567\" height=\"540\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6151\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aphex-twin-logo-wordmark-01.jpg 567w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aphex-twin-logo-wordmark-01-300x286.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px\" /></p>\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"890\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chosen-lords-cover-art-aphex-twin-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Chosen Lords cover art Aphex Twin\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"6152\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6152\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chosen-lords-cover-art-aphex-twin-01.jpg 1000w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chosen-lords-cover-art-aphex-twin-01-300x267.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chosen-lords-cover-art-aphex-twin-01-700x623.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chosen-lords-cover-art-aphex-twin-01-768x684.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" />\n\n<p>Nostalgia.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.logodesignlove.com/aphex-twin/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">6139</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Marken und Signete</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.logodesignlove.com/marken-und-signete</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.logodesignlove.com/marken-und-signete#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[David Airey]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 15:53:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Designs]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.logodesignlove.com/?p=6102</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[A book of 471 (mostly German) mid-century marks, selected and edited by Gerda Finsterer-Stuber.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marken-und-signete-spreads-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Marken und Signete book\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"6111\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"6111\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marken-und-signete-spreads-01.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marken-und-signete-spreads-01-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marken-und-signete-spreads-01-700x438.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marken-und-signete-spreads-01-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marken-und-signete-spreads-01-1200x750.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>The 1957 book <em>Marken und Signete</em>, published by Julius Hoffmann, features logos by designers such as Helmut Salden, Roger Excoffon, Anton Stankowski, Philip Grushkin, and George Salter.

He learned Spanish to be able to translate Lorca from his mother tongue. From 1949–55 he studied at IDGSA Painting Department in Istanbul, graduating from Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu Workshop.</p>\n<p>As a side job between 1955 and 1960 Maden designed logos, billboard displays, theatre decors, and cinema posters. It wasn’t until after 1960 when he focused on the graphic design discipline, concentrating mainly on publication design. He designed around 8,000 book and magazine covers for many publishing houses, as well as periodicals, brochures, packaging, labels, and around 500 logos. He crafted some of the fonts used in his books, and was the designer of many political election posters. In 1964 he established his own private workshop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01.jpg\" alt=\"Sait Maden photo\" width=\"700\" height=\"789\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5916\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sait-maden-photo-01-266x300.jpg 266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/168229518?h=8ed78ebb57&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<em>Trailer for the Sait Maden documentary by <a href=\"https://www.miracguldogan.com\">Miraç Güldoğan</a>.</em></p>\n<p>He was among the founders of the Graphic Artists Association in 1969, spending a period as chairman of the association. In 1979, in an effort to document the history of Turkish graphic design, Sait started the book project “Turkish Graphic Art from the Beginning to the Present.” This would be the first book of its kind for his country. Although he couldn’t complete the book due to a lack of time and support, parts of the project were published in the “Graphic Art” magazine, and a section was published in the journal “Cevre.” Sait’s attention to the lack of design awareness in Turkey and his comments on the absence of a graphic designer in the museum are thought to explain the lack of support for his work.</p>\n\n<img

“<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16112116-simgeler\">Simgeler</a>” (Icons) published in 1990. Sadly out of print, as far as I can tell. In the preface he wrote, “Since my first award-winning icon was drawn in 1955, I have been an observer and practitioner for fifty years. In these fifty years, I have drawn hundreds of symbols.” <a href=\"https://saltonline.org/en/2238/sadik-karamustafa-ile-solun-70lerdeki-gorsel-seruveni-uzerine\">Sadık Karamustafa</a> said the following about Sait, “It would be fair to say that he is the designer who brought the contemporary typographic approach to Turkish graphic design.”</p>\n<p>In 1996, he founded Çekirdek Publishing in order to publish poetry and translation books. He reflected the different moods that literature brought him into his various illustration styles.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\"

href=\"https://nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/story-of-motoring/the-motoring-montagus/\">Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</a> was one of Britain’s motoring pioneers. As founder and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine, he employed an illustrator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Robinson_Sykes\">Charles Sykes</a>, and a private secretary, <a href=\"https://www.beaulieu.co.uk/news/women-in-motorsport-social-history-eleanor-thornton/\">Eleanor Velasco Thornton</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1909, Lord Montagu commissioned Sykes (who was also a sculptor) to make a mascot for his Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Sykes produced a statue of a young woman in fluttering robes, which he named “The Whisper.” The figure is holding a finger to her lips, which some claim is a reference to Lord Montagu’s close relationship with Eleanor. Others suggest, more prosaically, that it relates to the engine’s quietness.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"The Whisper, Rolls-Royce, Charles Sykes\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5893\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5893\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-700x435.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-768x477.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-whisper-rolls-royce-charles-sykes-01-1200x746.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>Whatever the truth, The Whisper went on to adorn every Montagu Rolls-Royce. Soon, other owners were having their own ornaments made, much to the displeasure of Rolls-Royce general managing director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Johnson\">Claude Johnson</a>. In 1910, Johnson commissioned Sykes to make an official mascot to protect the company’s products from these unsightly additions. Sykes subtly reinterpreted The Whisper, and created what become known as the Spirit of Ecstasy.</p>\n\n<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Charles Sykes Spirit of Ecstasy\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5878\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5878\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01.jpg 2000w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-700x490.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1536x1075.jpg 1536w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1200x840.jpg 1200w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/charles-sykes-spirit-of-ecstasy-01-1860x1302.jpg 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" />\n\n<p>Challenging the social conventions of the time, her appearance became instantly iconic, leaning into the wind, arms outstretched, her dress billowing as if in flight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04.jpg\" alt=\"Spirit of Ecstasy\" width=\"700\" height=\"992\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5887\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-04-212x300.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Charles Sykes made the mascots from February 1911, until his daughter, Jo, took over in 1928. Jo, the only child of Charles and Jessica Sykes, made the mascots from then until 1939, and has written that her mascot production was about seven per week. This suggests that only about forty percent of the Rolls-Royce cars manufactured between 1911 and 1939 were ordered with mascots (an optional extra). We know that the Sykes’ ceased mascot manufacture after 1939 but most pre-WWII Rolls-Royce cars seen today wear mascots. That would mean that perhaps half of the mascots now on these cars are copies, not made by Charles or his daughter.</p>\n\n<img width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Spirit of Ecstasy\" loading=\"lazy\" link=\"none\" columns=\"1\" size=\"full\" ids=\"5886\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"5886\" srcset=\"https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03.jpg 1400w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spirit-of-ecstasy-03-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" />\n\n<p>The most common question asked by Rolls-Royce owners is whether their mascot is original. The answer depends on what’s defined as “original.” Charles Sykes’ master models are obviously original. From these he made copies, usually four. He then used these as masters to make agar jelly moulds from which in turn he cast wax patterns to be used to make castings. He then polished these castings and sold them to Rolls-Royce to be put on cars. Almost everyone would call these last original, even though they are copies of copies of Sykes’ original sculpture.</p>\n<p>In recent years the emblem was carefully redrawn by Marina Willer’s team at <a href=\"https://www.pentagram.com/work/rolls-royce-3/story\">Pentagram</a> in London.</p>\n\n<img width=\"2236\" height=\"1319\"

He soon liquidated his pharmaceutical business and focused his full attention on Coca-Cola. Along with his brother John S Candler, John Pemberton’s former partner (and logo designer) Frank Robinson, and two other associates, Asa formed a Georgia corporation named <a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com\">The Coca-Cola Company</a>. Initial capital was $100,000.</p>\n<p>In 1894, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_A._Biedenharn\">Joseph A Biedenharn</a> was so impressed by the growing demand for Coca-Cola at his soda fountain that he installed bottling machinery in the rear of his store and began to sell cases of the drink to farms and lumber camps up and down the Mississippi River. He was the first bottler of Coca-Cola.</p>\n<p>By 1895 Coca-Cola was drunk in every state.</p>\n<p>The first celebrity to be featured in Coca-Cola advertising was model and music hall singer, Hilda Clark (below).
