      "content_text": "Last week, Ali Spittel tweeted…\n\n\nDon’t repeat yourself too much, but also don’t abstract your code to an extent that it is not understandable.\n\n\nIn programing, DRY is an acronym that stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It’s good advice that’s sometimes treated as a Holy Grail in coding.\n\nSometimes, a little repeated code a good thing. Today, I wanted to look at some specific examples of when DRY is good, and when it creates more problems than it solves.\n\nLet’s dig in!\n\nWhy DRY?\n\nWith any code you write, the “ideal” structure is one that makes your code easier to understand and maintain long term.\n\nBlocks of repeated code create maintenance challenges.\n\nConsider this function, contentList(). It takes an array of items and generates an unordered list (ul) as an HTML string from them.\n/**\n * Create a list of linked content items\n * @param  {Array}   items The content\n * @return {String}        The content list HTML\n */\nfunction contentList (items) {\n\tlet list = items.map(function (item) {\n\t\treturn `<li id=\"${item.id}\"><a class=\"link-no-underline\" href=\"${item.url}\">${item.title}</a></li>`;\n\t}).join('');\n\treturn`<ul>${list}</ul>`;\n}\n\nWhat if you also needed a way to create an ordered list (ol) from an array of items? You might create a second function, contentListOrdered().\n/**\n * Create a list of linked content items\n * @param  {Array}   items The content\n * @return {String}        The content list HTML\n */\nfunction contentListOrdered (items) {\n\tlet list = items.map(function (item) {\n\t\treturn `<li id=\"${item.id}\"><a class=\"link-no-underline\" href=\"${item.url}\">${item.title}</a></li>`;\n\t}).join('');\n\treturn`<ol>${list}</ol>`;\n}\n\nThis absolutely works! But, now you’re also repeating yourself.\n\nImagine that something changes. Maybe one of the properties in the array of items gets renamed. Maybe you want to remove a class. Maybe you want to add an icon.\n\nWhatever it is, now you need to make that same change in two places. This is where DRY programming comes in.\n\nMaking functions DRY\n\nWith our content list functions, the only difference between them is whether the list is ordered or unordered.\n\nThis makes it a great candidate for abstraction! We can add a second property to our contentList() function, ordered. If true, we’ll return an ordered list. If not, we’ll return an unordered list instead.\n/**\n * Create a list of linked content items\n * @param  {Array}   items   The content\n * @param  {Boolean} ordered If true, return an ordered list\n * @return {String}          The content list HTML\n */\nfunction contentList (items, ordered) {\n\tlet list = items.map(function (item) {\n\t\treturn `<li id=\"${item.id}\"><a class=\"link-no-underline\" href=\"${item.url}\">${item.title}</a></li>`;\n\t}).join('');\n\treturn ordered ? `<ol>${list}</ol>` : `<ul>${list}</ul>`;\n}\n\nWith one function parameter and a one-line code change, we removed six lines of code and a bunch of future maintenance challenges. That’s great!\n\nBut sometimes, you can take this too far.\n\nToo much abstraction is bad\n\nIn the portal that my students use to access their courses, books, and workshops, I have two endpoints.\n\nOne handles all of the account management stuff: logging in, changing your password, and so on. The other is used to get product data to render into the UI.\n\nI have two utility functions to help me with that.\n/**\n * Make a call to the courses API\n * @param  {Object}  data  Data to send with the API [optional]\n * @return {Promise}       The fetch Promise\n */\nfunction callAPI (data) {\n\treturn fetch('/account-endpoint', {\n\t\tmethod: 'POST',\n\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',\n\t\t\t'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n\t\t},\n\t\tbody: buildQuery(data)\n\t}).then(function (response) {\n\t\treturn response.json();\n\t}).then(function (data) {\n\t\tif (data.code >= 200 && data.code < 300) return data;\n\t\tthrow data;\n\t});\n}\n\n/**\n * Get data for a product\n * @return {Promise} The fetch Promise\n */\nfunction getProductData (api) {\n\treturn fetch(`/product-endpoint&api=${api}`).then(function (response) {\n\t\treturn response.json();\n\t}).then(function (data) {\n\t\tif (data.code >= 200 && data.code < 300) return data;\n\t\tthrow data;\n\t}).catch(function (error) {\n\t\tif (error.code === 401) {\n\t\t\tlogoutUser();\n\t\t}\n\t});\n}\n\nBoth of these methods using fetch() to call an API. They both accept some data as an argument. They both convert the response to JSON, and handle errors.\n\nIt’s tempting to look at these and try to wrap them into one utility function.\n\nBut they have a handful of small differences that make additional abstraction worse than just having two functions.\n\nThe callAPI() method sends POST requests. The getProductData() method makes GET requests. The endpoint for each is different. The headers are different. The way data is passed along to the API is different. The way errors are handled is different.\nfunction getData (product, data) {\n\n\t// Setup all of the options\n\tlet endpoint = product ? `/product-endpoint&api=${api}` : '/account-endpoint';\n\tlet options = {};\n\tif (!products) {\n\t\toptions = {\n\t\t\tmethod: 'POST',\n\t\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\t'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',\n\t\t\t\t'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tbody: buildQuery(data)\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n\t// Make the call\n\tlet call = fetch(endpoint, options).then(function (response) {\n\t\treturn response.json();\n\t}).then(function (data) {\n\t\tif (data.code >= 200 && data.code < 300) return data;\n\t\tthrow data;\n\t});\n\n\t// If it's the product API, handle errors\n\tif (product) {\n\t\tcall.catch(function (error) {\n\t\t\tif (error.code === 401) {\n\t\t\t\tlogoutUser();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\t// Return the API call\n\treturn call;\n\n}\n\nBy the time you account for all of these differences, you end up with an abstracted function that’s more bloated and less usable than just having two functions.\n\nI often tell my students “readability is more important than brevity.” It’s also more important than abstraction.",

A few weeks ago, he wrote about how the div element isn’t as terrible as some people make it out to be.\n\nBut today, I wanted to share a recent post he wrote on how to announce content to screen reader users.\n\n\nLive regions are elements that inform assistive technologies, such as screen readers, that their descendant content may update. And, in such situations those updates need to be relayed to their users.\n\nLive regions may be implemented into a web page via three different methods:\n\n\nUsing specific ARIA live region roles, such as alert, log or status. There’s also marquee and timer… but more on those in a second.\nUsing the aria-live attribute to turn “any element” into a live region. There are three states that a live region may be in.\n\n\nassertive: high importance updates which take precedence over other announcements.\npolite: announcements that will be made at the next opportunity.\noff: announcements will not be made unless focus is presently on the live region element.\n\nUsing HTML’s native <output> element.

Pass in the element to create, without angled brackets (<>), as an argument\nlet div = document.createElement('div');\nlet link = document.createElement('a');\nlet article = document.createElement('article');\n\nYou can use any valid HTML tag, and even create custom ones, too. For example, these also work.\nlet chicken = document.createElement('chicken'); // <chicken></chicken>\nlet placeholder = document.createElement('_'); // <_></_>\n\nYou can manipulate an element created with document.createElement() like you would any other element in the DOM. Add classes, attributes, styles, and more.\nlet div = document.createElement('div');\ndiv.textContent = 'Hello, world!';\ndiv.className = 'new-div';\ndiv.id = 'new-div';\ndiv.setAttribute('data-div', 'new');\ndiv.style.color = '#fff';\ndiv.style.backgroundColor = 'rebeccapurple';\n\nHere’s a demo of the document.createElement() method.\n\nThe Node.before() method\n\nThe Node.before() method inserts elements and strings before another element. Call the Node.before() method on the node you want to insert before, and pass in one or more new elements or strings as arguments.\n<div id=\"app\">Good evening</div>// Create a new element\nlet p = document.createElement('p');\np.textContent = 'Hello!';\n\n// Get the target node\nlet app = document.querySelector('#app');\n\n// Insert the new node before the target node\n// <p>Hello!</p><div id=\"app\">Good evening</div>\napp.before(p);\n\n// You can inject more than one item by passing in multiple arguments\n// <p>Hello!</p>What's poppin'<div id=\"app\">Good evening</div>\napp.before(p, `What's poppin?`);\n\nHere’s a demo of the Node.before() method.\n\nThe Node.after() method\n\nThe Node.after() method inserts elements and strings after another element. Call the Node.after() method on the node you want to insert after, and pass in one or more new elements or strings as arguments.\n<div id=\"app\">Good morning</div>// Create a new element\nlet p = document.createElement('p');\np.textContent = 'Hello!';\n\n// Get the target node\nlet app = document.querySelector('#app');\n\n// Insert the new node after the target node\n// <div id=\"app\">Good morning</div><p>Hello!</p>\napp.after(p);\n\n// You can inject more than one item by passing in multiple arguments\n// <div id=\"app\">Good morning</div><p>Hello!</p>What's poppin'\napp.after(p, `What's poppin?`);\n\nHere’s a demo of the Node.after() method.\n\nThe Element.append() method\n\nYou can use the Element.append() method to insert one or more elements or strings at the end of a set elements inside a shared parent. Call the Element.append() method on the target node, and pass in one or more new elements or strings as arguments.\n<ul id=\"list\">\n\t<li>Item 1</li>\n\t<li>Item 2</li>\n\t<li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>// Create a new element\nlet li = document.createElement('li');\nli.textContent = 'I am new here.';\n\n// Create another new element\nlet liToo = document.createElement('li');\nliToo.textContent = `I'm new, too!`;\n\n// Get the parent node\nlet list = document.querySelector('#list');\n\n// Insert the new node after the last element in the parent node\n// ...<li>Item 3</li><li>I am new here.</li>\nlist.append(li);\n\n// You can inject more than one item by passing in multiple arguments\n// ...<li>Item 3</li><li>I am new here.</li><li>I'm new, too!</li>\nlist.append(li, liToo);\n\nHere’s a demo of the Element.append() method.\n\nThe Element.prepend() method\n\nYou can use the Element.prepend() method to insert one or more elements or strings at the beginning of a set elements inside a shared parent. Call the Element.prepend() method on the target node, and pass in one or more new elements or strings as arguments.\n<ul id=\"list\">\n\t<li>Item 1</li>\n\t<li>Item 2</li>\n\t<li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>// Create a new element\nlet li = document.createElement('li');\nli.textContent = 'I am new here.';\n\n// Create another new element\nlet liToo = document.createElement('li');\nliToo.textContent = `I'm new, too!`;\n\n// Get the parent node\nlet list = document.querySelector('#list');\n\n// Insert the new node before the first element in the parent node\n// <li>I am new here.</li><li>Item 1</li>...\nlist.prepend(li);\n\n// You can inject more than one item by passing in multiple arguments\n// <li>I am new here.</li><li>I'm new, too!</li><li>Item 1</li>...\nlist.prepend(li, liToo);\n\nHere’s a demo of the Element.prepend() method.\n\nThe Node.replaceWith() method\n\nThe Node.replaceWith() method replaces an element (and all of its HTML elements and content) with another. Call the Node.replaceWith() method on the target node, and pass in one or more elements or strings as arguments.\n<h1>Good evening</h1>// Get the target element\nlet h1 = document.querySelector('h1');\n\n// Create a new element\nlet p = document.createElement('p');\np.textContent = 'Good morning';\n\n// Replace the target with the new element\n// <p>Good morning</p>\nh1.replaceWith(p);\n\n// You can replace it with more than one item by passing in multiple arguments\n// <p>Good morning</p>How are you today?\nh1.replaceWith(p, 'How are you today?');\n\nHere’s a demo of the Node.replaceWith() method.",

' + greeting.textContent;\n\n// HTML elements are automatically encoded and rendered as-is\ngreeting.textContent = '<p>See you later!</p>';\n\nHere’s a demo of the Node.textContent property.\n\nThe Element.innerText property\n\nThe Element.innerText property gets and sets the rendered text of an element (and omits the markup).\n\nUnlike the Node.textContent property, the Element.innerText property returns only rendered text, similar to what a user would be able to select with their cursor or the keyboard when highlighting text.\n\nLike Node.textContent, any HTML elements included in a string when setting content are automatically encoded and rendered as-is.\n<div class=\"greeting\">\n\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\tp {\n\t\t\tcolor: rebeccapurple;\n\t\t}\n\t</style>\n\t<p hidden>This is not rendered.</p>\n\t<p>Hello world!</p>\n</div>let elem = document.querySelector('.greeting');\n\n// Get text content\n// returns \"Hello world!\"\nlet text = elem.innerText;\n\n// Set text content\n// This completely replaces whats there, including any HTML elements\nelem.innerText = 'We can dynamically change the content.';\n\n// Add text to the end of an element's existing content\nelem.innerText += ' Add this after what is already there.';\n\n// Add text to the beginning of an element's existing content\nelem.innerText = 'We can add this to the beginning. ' + elem.innerText;\n\n// HTML elements are automatically encoded and rendered as-is\nelem.innerText = '<p>See you later!</p>';\n\nHere’s a demo of the Element.innerText property.\n\nWhich one should you use?\n\nGenerally speaking, if you’re only modifying text, using the Node.textContent property is your best, safest bet.\n\nFor modifying HTML, the Element.innerHTML property is very useful, but does have some security concerns that we’ll look at in another article.",

If you care about performance (and you should), using only browser-native JavaScript is the absolute fastest you can get.</p>\n\n<p>But, newer tools like Solid and Preact performed <em>really close</em> to vanilla JS. Shockingly, so did Vue v3.</p>\n\n<p>Why? They were all written fairly recently, and feature far fewer abstractions under-the-hood than older libraries like React and Angular do. In otherwords, they&rsquo;re a lot closer to vanilla JS than their peers.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, while Svelte has a library-like authoring experience, the exported code is mostly HTML with a sprinkling of vanilla JS. New kid on the block Astro wasn&rsquo;t tested, but I&rsquo;d expect similar results as Svelte.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"static-site-generators\">Static Site Generators</h2>\n\n<p>Static Site Generators (SSGs) take markdown files with content and template files with HTML, and mash them together to create a bunch of prerendered HTML files.</p>\n\n<p>They give you the authoring benefits of a tool like WordPress, with the performance benefits of hand-written HTML.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of JavaScript library proponents are quick to point out that you can now use React and Vue as SSGs, thanks to frameworks like Next.js (React), Nuxt.js (Vue), and Gatsby (also React).</p>\n\n<p>But, these tools still output client-side JS. A lot of it, in fact!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The median JS size for React-based Gatsby and Next.js and Vue-based Nuxt.js all stand at around 700 KB. This number is similar to the median for React and Vue in general.</li>\n<li>Compared to that, Go-based Hugo and Ruby-based Jekyll stand at 177 KB and 129 KB respectively.</li>\n<li>JS framework-based SSGs serve a median of over 500 KB of JS more than those not based in JS.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Old-school SSGs like <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> (what my site is powered by) and <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> where orders of magnitude smaller, and also 3x as likely to have good mobile performance scores.</p>\n\n<p>The data didn&rsquo;t look at <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">11ty</a>, which is built on Node. But I would expect it have similar results as Hugo and Jekyll, as it&rsquo;s built more like the old-school SSGs and not like a JS library-turned-SSG.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-key-takeaways\">More key takeaways</h2>\n\n<p>So, what should you take away from this?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Test your site and app performance on 3g.</li>\n<li>Using vanilla JS whenever you can.</li>\n<li>If you <em>need</em> a JS library, Preact is a no-brainer choice over React.</li>\n<li>Multi-page apps with SSGs are a better choice than SPAs with JS libraries.</li>\n</ul>",

If you care about performance (and you should), using only browser-native JavaScript is the absolute fastest you can get.\n\nBut, newer tools like Solid and Preact performed really close to vanilla JS. Shockingly, so did Vue v3.\n\nWhy? They were all written fairly recently, and feature far fewer abstractions under-the-hood than older libraries like React and Angular do. In otherwords, they’re a lot closer to vanilla JS than their peers.\n\nSimilarly, while Svelte has a library-like authoring experience, the exported code is mostly HTML with a sprinkling of vanilla JS. New kid on the block Astro wasn’t tested, but I’d expect similar results as Svelte.\n\nStatic Site Generators\n\nStatic Site Generators (SSGs) take markdown files with content and template files with HTML, and mash them together to create a bunch of prerendered HTML files.\n\nThey give you the authoring benefits of a tool like WordPress, with the performance benefits of hand-written HTML.\n\nA lot of JavaScript library proponents are quick to point out that you can now use React and Vue as SSGs, thanks to frameworks like Next.js (React), Nuxt.js (Vue), and Gatsby (also React).\n\nBut, these tools still output client-side JS. A lot of it, in fact!\n\n\n\nThe median JS size for React-based Gatsby and Next.js and Vue-based Nuxt.js all stand at around 700 KB. This number is similar to the median for React and Vue in general.\nCompared to that, Go-based Hugo and Ruby-based Jekyll stand at 177 KB and 129 KB respectively.\nJS framework-based SSGs serve a median of over 500 KB of JS more than those not based in JS.\n\n\n\nOld-school SSGs like Hugo (what my site is powered by) and Jekyll where orders of magnitude smaller, and also 3x as likely to have good mobile performance scores.\n\nThe data didn’t look at 11ty, which is built on Node. But I would expect it have similar results as Hugo and Jekyll, as it’s built more like the old-school SSGs and not like a JS library-turned-SSG.\n\nMore key takeaways\n\nSo, what should you take away from this?\n\n\nTest your site and app performance on 3g.\nUsing vanilla JS whenever you can.\nIf you need a JS library, Preact is a no-brainer choice over React.\nMulti-page apps with SSGs are a better choice than SPAs with JS libraries.\n",

      "content_text": "In JavaScript, event listeners have to be attached to individual elements. You can’t attach them to an array or node list of matching elements like you might in jQuery.\n\nToday, we’re going to look at a technique that you can use listen for the same even on multiple elements without having to attach to each element individually: event delegation.\n\nLet’s dig in!\n\nThe EventTarget.addEventListener() method\n\nAs a quick primer, you can use the EventTarget.addEventListener() method to listen for events on an element. You can find a full list of available events on the Mozilla Developer Network.\n\nAttached the EventTarget.addEventListener() method to the element you want to listen for events on. It accepts two arguments: the event to listen for, and a callback function to run when the event happens.\n\nYou can pass the event into the callback function as an argument. The event.target property is the element that triggered the event. The event object has other properties as well, many of them specific to the type of event that occurred.\nlet btn = document.querySelector('#click-me');\n\nbtn.addEventListener('click', function (event) {\n\tconsole.log(event); // The event details\n\tconsole.log(event.target); // The clicked element\n});\n\nHere’s a demo.\n\nListening for the same event on multiple elements\n\nOne trick to listen a specific event on bunch of elements at once is to attach your listener to a parent element that your elements are contained within, such as the window or document.\n\nEvents that happens on elements inside that parent element bubble up.\n\nThe event.target property is the element that triggered the event. We can use that property to check if the element that triggered the event has a matching selector.\n// Listen for clicks on the entire window\ndocument.addEventListener('click', function (event) {\n\n\t// If the clicked element has the `.click-me` class, it's a match!\n\tif (event.target.matches('.click-me')) {\n\t\t// Do something...\n\t}\n\n});\n\nHere’s another demo.\n\nWhy wouldn’t you just loop through each element and attach an event listener?\n\nYou can attach event listeners to individual elements by looping over each one, like this.\n/**\n * This works, but it's bad for performance\n * DON'T DO IT!\n */\nlet btns = document.querySelectorAll('.click-me');\n\nfor (let btn of btns) {\n\tbtn.addEventListener('click', function (event) {\n\t\tconsole.log(event); // The event details\n\t\tconsole.log(event.target); // The clicked element\n\t});\n}\n\nBut if you have a lot of elements, it can actually be worse for performance than event delegation.\n\nEvery event listener you create uses memory in the browser. It’s “cheaper” for the browser to track one event and fire it on every click that it is to manage multiple events.\n\nIf you’re only listening for events on a single element, feel free to attach directly to that element. But if you’re listening for events on multiple elements, I’d recommend using event delegation.\n\nCapturing events that don’t bubble\n\nCertain events, like focus, don’t bubble. In order to use event delegation with events that don’t bubble, you can set an optional third argument on the EventTarget.addEventListener() method, called useCapture, to true.\n// Listen for all focus events in the document\ndocument.addEventListener('focus', function (event) {\n\t// Run functions whenever an element in the document comes into focus\n}, true);\n\nYou can determine if useCapture should be set to true or false by looking at the event details page on the Mozilla Developer Network (like this one for the focus event).\n\nIf Bubbles in the chart at the top of the page is “No,” you need to set useCapture to true to use event delegation.\n\nHere’s one last demo.",

      "content_text": "In today’s article, we’re going to look at three different techniques you can use to get and set CSS properties with vanilla JS.\n\nLet’s dig in!\n\nA quick note on case\n\nVanilla JavaScript uses camelCased versions of the properties you would use in CSS.\n\nFor example, background-image in CSS is backgroundImage in JavaScript. The font-weight property in CSS is fontWeight in JavaScript.\n\nThe Mozilla Developer Network provides a comprehensive list of available attributes and their JavaScript counterparts.\n\nThe Element.style property\n\nYou can get and set inline styles for an element with the Element.style property.\n\nThe Element.style property is a read-only object. You can get and set individual style properties on it using camelCase style names as properties on the Element.style object.\n<p id=\"sandwich\" style=\"background-color: green; color: white;\">\n\tSandwich\n</p>let sandwich = document.querySelector('#sandwich');\n\n// Get a style\n// If this style is not set as an inline style directly on the element, it returns an empty string\nlet bgColor = sandwich.style.backgroundColor; // this will return \"green\"\nlet fontWeight = sandwich.style.fontWeight; // this will return \"\"\n\n// Set the background-color style property\nsandwich.style.backgroundColor = 'purple';\n\nYou can also get and set a string representation of the entire inline style property on the element itself with the Element.style.cssText property.\n// Get the styles on an element\n// returns \"background-color: green; color: white;\"\nlet styles = sandwich.style.cssText;\n\n// Completely replace the inline styles on an element\nsandwich.style.cssText = 'font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold;';\n\n// Add additional styles\nsandwich.style.cssText += 'color: purple;';\n\nHere’s a demo.\n\nThe window.getComputedStyle() method\n\nThe window.getComputedStyle() method gets the actual computed style of an element. This factors in browser default styles as well as external stylesheets being used on the page.\nlet sandwich = document.querySelector('#sandwich');\nlet bgColor = window.getComputedStyle(sandwich).backgroundColor;\n\nThis is read only, and can’t be used to actually modify styles on an element.\n\nHere’s another demo.\n\nAdding a styles to the document\n\nThe Element.style property is useful for adding inline styles to specific elements.\n\nBut what if you want to add styles to all elements that match a specific selector? You could loop through each matching element and add styles using the Element.style property.\nlet wizards = document.querySelectorAll('.wizard');\n\nfor (let wizard of wizards) {\n\twizard.style.backgroundColor = 'rebeccapurple';\n\twizard.style.color = 'white';\n}\n\nOr, you can add CSS directly to the document by creating a style element and appending it into the DOM.\n\nFirst, create a style element using the document.createElement() method. Then, add your CSS to it using the Element.textContent property.\n\nFinally, you can inject it into the document using the Element.append() method. I like to append into the document.head, but document.body works, too.\nlet style = document.createElement('style');\nstyle.textContent =\n\t`.wizard {\n\t\tbackground-color: rebeccapurple;\n\t\tcolor: white;\n\t}`;\ndocument.head.append(style);\n\nHere’s one last demo.",

      "content_html": "<p>Yesterday, one of my students asked me how I record <a href=\"https://vanillajsguides.com\">my JavaScript video courses</a> and <a href=\"https://vanillajsacademy.com\">workshop lessons</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I wanted to share both my technical setup and general approach to making videos. Let&rsquo;s dig in!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"screen-recording\">Screen recording</h2>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/\">Screenflow</a> for screen recording.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s macOS only. If you&rsquo;re feeling cheap, you can also just use QuickTime, but I found that makes my fans spin like crazy. Screenflow also has some great editing features, including easy cropping and zooming, noise isolation, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re on Windows, you can alternative use <a href=\"https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html\">Camtasia</a>, which I haven&rsquo;t used in years but used to when I was on a Windows rig.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"microphone\">Microphone</h2>\n\n<p>For microphones, I used a <a href=\"https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/\">Blue Yeti</a> for years.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the most entry-level of &ldquo;nice microphones,&rdquo; with a price to match. The audio quality on it is actually <em>really</em> good, if you configure it and use it properly.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known as a <em>condenser microphone</em>. It picks up a wide range of tones, but is also very sensitive to low volumes, and thus, picks up a lot of background noise.</p>\n\n<p>Now that everyone is remote, there&rsquo;s a lot more noise in my house, which was making recording very difficult. In a sound-treated space or dedicated studio, the Blue Yeti is amazing. But it&rsquo;s very unforgiving to background noise.</p>\n\n<p>I recently upgraded to the <a href=\"https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7\">Shure MV7</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known as a <em>dynamic microphone</em>. You need to put your mouth much closer to microphone to pick up a good audio level, but it isolates almost all noise that&rsquo;s not directly in front of it, which is just what I needed!</p>\n\n<p>Shure makes some other microphones that are technically a bit better, but the MV7 is a USB mic, which lets me plug it directly into my computer. Most of their other mics are XLR microphones, which require a special interface to boost the audio before connecting to your computer.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re on a budget, any headset with a built-in microphone is a great place to start. Just beware that the mic on Apple&rsquo;s old-school corded airbuds tend to drag across beards and clothing and pick up noise that way.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"boom-arm\">Boom Arm</h2>\n\n<p>While upgrading my microphone, I also purchased a <a href=\"https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1\">RØDE PSA1 boom arm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This lets me position the mic directly in front of my mouth, without interfering with my keyboard or notes as I record. Some folks recommend optional things like shock arms to absorb desk movement, but I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s totally unnecessary with this mic.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of a boom arm, you can use a desk stand. I did for years. They do sometimes pick up typing noises, so you have to be a bit careful about how hard you hit the desk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"positioning-the-mic\">Positioning the Mic</h2>\n\n<p>The microphone has a built-in pop filter to minimize the popping noises that result from saying &ldquo;p words&rdquo; (called <em>plosives</em>).</p>\n\n<p>I found that all of my s words sounded slurred with the new mic. From research, this often happens when a mic is positioned closer to your mouth.</p>\n\n<p>After some trial and error, I found that positioning it below my mouth pointed up made that go away. But it&rsquo;s different for each person. Try positioning the microphone to the side, from the bottom, and from above until you find something that works best for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"text-editor-settings\">Text Editor Settings</h2>\n\n<p>While I normally code in a dark theme, I use a light theme for my recordings, as many folks report that it&rsquo;s easier to see and read in well lit settings.</p>\n\n<p>I boost the size of my text up to 19 pixels to make it easier to read on smaller screens. It&rsquo;s a bit awkwardly large on my end, but much better for the people watching my videos.</p>\n\n<p>I use Monokai Light as my syntax highlighting theme. I&rsquo;ve found that it has good contrast for easier visibility.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n\n<p>I prefer talking over code to showing my face. Worrying about whether or not I&rsquo;m making stupid faces makes recording even harder than it already it is.</p>\n\n<p>I used to use a script, and restart my recordings every time I fucked up and said an &ldquo;ooh,&rdquo; &ldquo;um,&rdquo;, or &ldquo;ah.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Then, I did a few live streaming things, and had folks tell me they preferred the more casual tone of those over my well scripted videos. Some research indicates that filler words (the &ldquo;ums&rdquo; and such) often go unnoticed consciously, but trigger brains to pay more attention to what&rsquo;s being said.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I tend to write out a few notes on a piece of paper and &ldquo;just wing it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I aim for a single take with no edits beyond cropping the frame to HD and adjusting the audio level. If the video is longer than a minute or two, I may copy/paste the text into an email and keep it positioned on my phone in front of me instead.</p>\n\n<p>But I always keep it conversational, and leave in the mess ups and debugging. Students have actively told me they like to see that stuff and how I work through it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"creating-the-content\">Creating the Content</h2>\n\n<p>Each video starts with me creating the source code.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I write up how it works. Then, I use that text version to help guide the talking points in the video. Some folks prefer to learn by reading, so I include text options as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hosting\">Hosting</h2>\n\n<p>I host all of my videos on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\">Vimeo Pro</a>.</p>\n\n<p>They handle compressing the video, and dynamically serve it at different rates based on the user&rsquo;s bandwidth and screen size. They also let me control the UI of the video player, and where it can be embedded. Finally, they have a &ldquo;download video&rdquo; link, which is also useful for my students.</p>\n\n<p>Vimeo Pro is money well spent!</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> for business videos, you need at least Vimeo Pro. The Vimeo Plus plan does not allow business videos under its TOS.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"captions\">Captions</h2>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.rev.com/\">Rev</a> for video captioning.</p>\n\n<p>You can link your Vimeo account directly in Rev using the Vimeo API, and select the videos you want to caption directly from the Rev UI. Captions are uploaded directly to the video without you having to manually upload them.</p>\n\n<p>This saves me a <em>ton</em> of time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"anything-i-missed\">Anything I missed?</h2>\n\n<p>Hope that helps! Let me know if there&rsquo;s anything you want me to talk about that I missed.</p>",

Screenflow also has some great editing features, including easy cropping and zooming, noise isolation, and so on.\n\nIf you’re on Windows, you can alternative use Camtasia, which I haven’t used in years but used to when I was on a Windows rig.\n\nMicrophone\n\nFor microphones, I used a Blue Yeti for years.\n\nIt’s the most entry-level of “nice microphones,” with a price to match. The audio quality on it is actually really good, if you configure it and use it properly.\n\nHowever, it’s what’s known as a condenser microphone. It picks up a wide range of tones, but is also very sensitive to low volumes, and thus, picks up a lot of background noise.\n\nNow that everyone is remote, there’s a lot more noise in my house, which was making recording very difficult. In a sound-treated space or dedicated studio, the Blue Yeti is amazing. But it’s very unforgiving to background noise.\n\nI recently upgraded to the Shure MV7.\n\nIt’s what’s known as a dynamic microphone. You need to put your mouth much closer to microphone to pick up a good audio level, but it isolates almost all noise that’s not directly in front of it, which is just what I needed!\n\nShure makes some other microphones that are technically a bit better, but the MV7 is a USB mic, which lets me plug it directly into my computer. Most of their other mics are XLR microphones, which require a special interface to boost the audio before connecting to your computer.\n\nIf you’re on a budget, any headset with a built-in microphone is a great place to start. Just beware that the mic on Apple’s old-school corded airbuds tend to drag across beards and clothing and pick up noise that way.\n\nBoom Arm\n\nWhile upgrading my microphone, I also purchased a RØDE PSA1 boom arm.\n\nThis lets me position the mic directly in front of my mouth, without interfering with my keyboard or notes as I record. Some folks recommend optional things like shock arms to absorb desk movement, but I’ve found that’s totally unnecessary with this mic.\n\nInstead of a boom arm, you can use a desk stand. I did for years. They do sometimes pick up typing noises, so you have to be a bit careful about how hard you hit the desk.\n\nPositioning the Mic\n\nThe microphone has a built-in pop filter to minimize the popping noises that result from saying “p words” (called plosives).\n\nI found that all of my s words sounded slurred with the new mic. From research, this often happens when a mic is positioned closer to your mouth.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I found that positioning it below my mouth pointed up made that go away. But it’s different for each person. Try positioning the microphone to the side, from the bottom, and from above until you find something that works best for you.\n\nText Editor Settings\n\nWhile I normally code in a dark theme, I use a light theme for my recordings, as many folks report that it’s easier to see and read in well lit settings.\n\nI boost the size of my text up to 19 pixels to make it easier to read on smaller screens. It’s a bit awkwardly large on my end, but much better for the people watching my videos.\n\nI use Monokai Light as my syntax highlighting theme. I’ve found that it has good contrast for easier visibility.\n\nApproach\n\nI prefer talking over code to showing my face. Worrying about whether or not I’m making stupid faces makes recording even harder than it already it is.\n\nI used to use a script, and restart my recordings every time I fucked up and said an “ooh,” “um,”, or “ah.”\n\nThen, I did a few live streaming things, and had folks tell me they preferred the more casual tone of those over my well scripted videos. Some research indicates that filler words (the “ums” and such) often go unnoticed consciously, but trigger brains to pay more attention to what’s being said.\n\nNow, I tend to write out a few notes on a piece of paper and “just wing it.”\n\nI aim for a single take with no edits beyond cropping the frame to HD and adjusting the audio level. If the video is longer than a minute or two, I may copy/paste the text into an email and keep it positioned on my phone in front of me instead.\n\nBut I always keep it conversational, and leave in the mess ups and debugging. Students have actively told me they like to see that stuff and how I work through it.\n\nCreating the Content\n\nEach video starts with me creating the source code.\n\nNext, I write up how it works. Then, I use that text version to help guide the talking points in the video. Some folks prefer to learn by reading, so I include text options as well.\n\nHosting\n\nI host all of my videos on Vimeo Pro.\n\nThey handle compressing the video, and dynamically serve it at different rates based on the user’s bandwidth and screen size. They also let me control the UI of the video player, and where it can be embedded. Finally, they have a “download video” link, which is also useful for my students.\n\nVimeo Pro is money well spent!\n\nNote: for business videos, you need at least Vimeo Pro. The Vimeo Plus plan does not allow business videos under its TOS.\n\nCaptions\n\nI use Rev for video captioning.\n\nYou can link your Vimeo account directly in Rev using the Vimeo API, and select the videos you want to caption directly from the Rev UI. Captions are uploaded directly to the video without you having to manually upload them.\n\nThis saves me a ton of time.\n\nAnything I missed?\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if there’s anything you want me to talk about that I missed.",

      "content_text": "This week, we’ve looked at various techniques for looping over arrays and objects.\n\nIn both articles I noted:\n\n\nin a real site or application, you might want to manipulate the data in some way.\n\n\nToday, we’re going to look at how to mutate and transform arrays. Let’s dig in!\n\nAn example array\n\nFor today’s article, lets use an array of wizards as an example. Each item in the array is an object with the wizard’s name and signature spell.\nlet wizards = [\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Merlin',\n\t\tspell: 'Dancing teacups'\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Gandalf',\n\t\tspell: 'You shall not pass!'\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Radagast',\n\t\tspell: 'Talk to animals'\n\t}\n];\n\nWe’ll transform it in various ways to create a new array.\n\nThe Array.map() method\n\nYou can use the Array.map() method to loop through each item in an array, transform it, and return a new array. Pass in a callback function that accepts three arguments: the current item in the loop, its index, and the array itself. All three are optional.\n\nWhatever you return inside the callback function becomes the new value at that index in the new array.\n\nIn this example, we’re creating a new array that contains just the wizard’s names.\n// returns [\"Merlin\", \"Gandalf\", \"Radagast\"]\nlet names = wizards.map(function (wizard) {\n\treturn wizard.name;\n});\n\nHere’s a demo of the Array.map() method.\n\nThe Array.filter() method\n\nYou can use the Array.filter() method to create a new array with only elements that pass a test you include as a callback function. The callback accepts three arguments: the current item in the loop’s value, its index, and the array itself. All three are optional.\n\nIn this example, we’re creating a new array that contains only wizards whose spell does not include an exclamation mark (!).\n// includes Merlin and Radagast, but not Gandalf\nlet quiet = wizards.filter(function (wizard) {\n\treturn !wizard.spell.includes('!');\n});\n\nHere’s a demo of the Array.filter() method.\n\nThe Array.reduce() method\n\nThe Array.reduce() method takes the content of an array and returns a single value. That value can be anything: a string, number, object, or even another array.\n\nThe Array.reduce() method accepts two arguments: a callback method to run against each item in the array, and a starting value. Both are required.\n\nThe callback also accepts two arguments: the accumulator, which is the current combined value, and the current item in the loop. Whatever you return is used as the accumulator for the next item in the loop. On the very first loop, that starting value is used instead.\n\nIn this example, we’re going to group our wizards into an object, organized by the number of characters in their spell. We’ll pass in an empty object ({}) as the starting value.\n// returns {15: [\"Merlin\", \"Radagast\"], 19: [\"Gandalf\"]}\nlet spellLengths = wizards.reduce(function (obj, wizard) {\n\n\t// Get the spell length\n\tlet length = wizard.spell.length;\n\n\t// if there's no property yet, create one\n\tif (!obj[length]) {\n\t\tobj[length] = [];\n\t}\n\n\t// Add the wizard to the object\n\tobj[length].push(wizard.name);\n\n}, {});\n\nHere’s a demo of the Array.reduce() method.\n\nA quick note about the Array.reduce() method: using a more verbose method (or combination of methods) typically results in more readable code. I tend to avoid this one now.\n\nThe Array.reverse() method\n\nYou can use the Array.reverse() method to reverse the order of items in an array.\n// Now Radagast is first and Merlin is last\nwizards.reverse();\n\nHere’s a demo of the Array.reverse() method.\n\nThe Array.join() method\n\nYou can use the Array.join() method to combine all items in an array into a string, separated by a delimiter that you can pass in as an argument. By default, it will use a comma (,) as the delimiter if one is not provided.\n\nIn this example, we’re using the Array.map() method to create an array of wizard names, and then joining them together, separated by a dash (-).\n// returns \"Merlin - Gandalf - Radagast\"\nlet wizardList = wizards.map(function (wizard) {\n\treturn wizard.name;\n}).join(' - ');\n\nHere’s a demo of the Array.join() method.\n\nUsing a loop\n\nYou can replicate any of the features of the dedicated methods above using an array loop.\n\nFor example, we can replicate the Array.map() method by first creating an empty array, and then looping through the wizards array and pushing items into the new one.\nlet names = [];\n\nfor (let wizard of wizards) {\n\tnames.push(wizard.name);\n}\n\nHere’s a demo of this technique.\n\nA lot of people who are learning JavaScript find this approach easier to read and understand because what you’re doing is more explicit. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, so choose whatever approach you personally find most readable.",

The idea was simple: someone visits <code>catsarethebest.com</code>, where they&rsquo;re loading <code>jquery.1.1.8.js</code> from the jQuery CDN. Then, that same person visits <code>dogsarebetter.com</code>, where that same file is hosted from that same CDN.</p>\n\n<p>Since the browser already loaded that file from that exact URL on another site, it&rsquo;s already cached and doesn&rsquo;t need to be downloaded again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Make a lot of sense, right? Problem is&hellip; browsers don&rsquo;t actually do that anymore.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cross-domain-caching-doesn-t-work-anymore\">Cross-domain caching doesn&rsquo;t work anymore</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/say-goodbye-to-resource-caching-across-sites-and-domains/\">In an article from 2020, Stefan Judis explains&hellip;</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839–as.svg</code> – I made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Historically, browsers used just the asset URL as the cache key. Modern implementations now use a combination of the URL, the requesting domain, and the current frame instead.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269\">Safari implemented an approach like this</a> as far back as 2013! Chrome started doing it in 2020. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#network_partitioning\">Firefox added this feature</a> at the start of 2021.</p>\n\n<p>As Stefan explains&hellip;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from unpkg.com, font files from Google fonts or GA&rsquo;s (Google Analytics) analytics.js, users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</p>\n\n<p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you should drop the third-parties and ship all resources yourself.

And that violates Europe&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, when the plaintiff visited the website, the page made the user&rsquo;s browser fetch a font from Google Fonts to use for some text, and this disclosed the netizen&rsquo;s IP address to the US internet giant. This kind of hot-linking is normal with Google Fonts; the issue here is that the visitor apparently didn&rsquo;t give permission for their IP address to be shared. The website could have avoided this drama by self-hosting the font, if possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The penalties for violating this ruling are pretty serious!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ruling directs the website to stop providing IP addresses to Google and threatens the site operator with a fine of €250,000 for each violation, or up to six months in prison, for continued improper use of Google Fonts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-what-can-you-do\">So&hellip; what can you do?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gomakethings.com/how-to-self-host-google-fonts/\">You can self-host your custom web fonts.</a></p>\n\n<p>I started doing that two years ago, out of privacy concerns with Google-hosted fonts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about how <a href=\"https://gomakethings.com/i-dont-know-if-youre-reading-this/\">I removed all tracking from my website and newsletter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the brilliant <a href=\"https://laurakalbag.com/\">Laura Kalbag</a> pointed out a vector I’d missed: Google Fonts. While the data is not as rich as you’d get from a full on analytics script, it still gives Google more information about who your visitors are.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only do you get a privacy benefit, but if you <a href=\"https://vanillajsguides.com/service-workers/\">pair self-hosting with service workers</a>, your fonts load amazingly fast with dramatically reduced data usage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-is-this-different-from-loading-assets-from-other-cdns\">How is this different from loading assets from other CDNs?</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not, really!</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you use Cloudflare, the visitor&rsquo;s IP address gets sent along with the request. Same with JSDelivr and other CDN-for-OSS-projects services.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this ruling affects how other CDNs will operate going forward, or if Google was targeted specifically because they&rsquo;re in the &ldquo;suck up data to sell ads&rdquo; business.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t<title>AHA programming, a nice balance between DRY and WET</title>\n\t\t\t\t<link>https://gomakethings.com/aha-programming-a-nice-balance-between-dry-and-wet/</link>\n\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 10:30:00 -0500</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<guid>https://gomakethings.com/aha-programming-a-nice-balance-between-dry-and-wet/</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[ On Tuesday, I wrote about DRY programing, and how it&rsquo;s actually OK to repeat yourself.\nSomeone pointed me to this article by Kent C.

It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For me, these two sentences really sum up years of evolving thinking and experience for me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the key is that we don&rsquo;t know what the future of code will be. We could spend weeks optimizing code for performance, or coming up with the best API for our new abstraction, only to find out the next day that we made incorrect assumptions and the API needs a complete rework or the feature the code was written for is no longer needed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gomakethings.com/its-ok-to-repeat-yourself-dry-coding-isnt-the-holy-grail/\">Go read Kent&rsquo;s entire article</a>, and the articles he links to.

A few weeks ago, he wrote about <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/01/20/divisive.html\">how the <code>div</code> element isn&rsquo;t as terrible as some people make it out to be</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But today, I wanted to share a recent post he wrote on <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/02/05/are-we-live.html\">how to announce content to screen reader users</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Live regions are elements that inform assistive technologies, such as screen readers, that their descendant content may update. And, in such situations those updates need to be relayed to their users.</p>\n\n<p>Live regions may be implemented into a web page via three different methods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using specific <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#live_region_roles\">ARIA live region roles</a>, such as <code>alert</code>, <code>log</code> or <code>status</code>. There’s also <code>marquee</code> and <code>timer</code>&hellip; but more on those in a second.</li>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-live\"><code>aria-live</code> attribute</a> to turn “any element” into a live region. There are three states that a live region may be in.\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>assertive</code>: high importance updates which take precedence over other announcements.</li>\n<li><code>polite</code>: announcements that will be made at the next opportunity.</li>\n<li><code>off</code>: announcements will not be made unless focus is presently on the live region element.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/07/10/the-output-element.html\">Using HTML’s native <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> element.</a> This element has the implicit ARIA role of <code>status</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why you would use one method over the other will depend on how you want the content exposed to your users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s article digs into the various approaches, and when and why you&rsquo;d choose one over the other.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve got a pretty good grasp on this, I&rsquo;d recommend <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/02/05/are-we-live.html\">giving the whole article a read</a>.
